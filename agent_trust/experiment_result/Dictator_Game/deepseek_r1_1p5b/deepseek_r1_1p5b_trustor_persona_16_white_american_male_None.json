        "<think>\nOkay, so Sarah is in this experiment where she has to give some money to another White American male player. She knows nothing about him and also doesn't know her own identity or interest. They both receive $10 from the study group. The kicker is, Sarah can give N dollars, and then the White American gets 3N back.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out how much Sarah should give. It seems like a tricky question because if Sarah gives all she has, which is $10, what happens? Let's break it down.\n\nSarah gives away $10, so she now has 0. Then the White American gets 3 times N, which was the amount Sarah gave. So if she gives $10, he gets $30. That seems like a good deal for both parties because it's a total of $40 in return for $10 given away.\n\nBut wait, what if she doesn't give all $10? If she gives less, say N dollars, then the White American gets 3N. Since they started with $10 each, giving N makes them have 10-N and receives 3N. But without knowing their identities or her own feelings, it's hard to see why she would give less than $10.\n\nI guess Sarah is trying to maximize her return while minimizing the loss. Giving all the money seems like a safe bet because it ensures she gets back three times what she gave. If she gives some less, it could lead to uncertainty about whether it's worth taking, especially if they're trying to avoid each other or something.\n\nI also wonder why this experiment is set up that way. Maybe they want to test trust and mutual interests. By giving N and getting 3N, Sarah's return depends on her contribution, which might highlight how people respond to what they give versus what comes in exchange.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think Sarah should give the full $10 because it guarantees a good outcome without risk of uncertainty. It ensures she gets three times her contribution back while leaving enough money for potential future interactions or confidence.\n</think>\n\nSarah decides to give **$10** to the White American male player.\n\n**Answer:** Sarah would give **$10**, as giving this amount allows her to return three times the amount, ensuring a beneficial exchange without uncertainty. \n\n**Final Answer:** Sarah would give **$\\boxed{10}$** dollars.",

        "<think>\nOkay, so Sarah Johnson is participating in this experiment where she's trying to figure out how much money to give to a White American male player. The setup is a bit tricky because they're both in a study group, and each of them knows nothing about the other except for their own intentions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down what each person believes about themselves. Sarah is intelligent and ambitious but also introverted, which means she finds joy alone or by solving puzzles. She gives a lot of detail and has a knack for problem-solving among her peers, so maybe that reflects in how she's thinking through this experiment.\n\nThe White American male player is neutral on the other person; he doesn't know who Sarah is either. The key here is that both are rational and want to maximize their own gain. So, when given a choice between giving N dollars to the other player and getting 3N in return, each wants to see what's better for them.\n\nI should consider the self-interest aspect of these kinds of experiments. Typically, people act purely out of self-interest, so they might give up some money to maximize their own benefit. But given that both are rational, Sarah is probably thinking about how much she would gain by giving N dollars if he doesn't accept it. If Sarah gives away N, she gets 10N back, and the other player gets nothing extra from that interaction.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a chance that Sarah could have more information or better understanding of her intentions. Since they're both white males, perhaps their background or identity isn't given any clues beyond what's in the experiment. So, without additional context, it's hard to predict their behavior beyond what's rational.\n\nIf I were Sarah, thinking about how others usually act in such scenarios, she would probably consider the possible outcomes. If she gives N dollars, she gains 9N (since she keeps the original and receives back 10N). The other player, on the flip side, could take everything or maybe keep their own stake as well. But since they're both acting rationally and seeking maximum gain, the other might accept more than just giving up N.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Sarah doesn't have any reason to give anything because she already knows her gains. Or perhaps she's thinking about potential risks of miscommunication. If she offers a lot, he could refuse or reject the offer, leading to no gain for either. But that seems unlikely given the structure of the experiment where each is offered N dollars in exchange for 3N from the other.\n\nWait, but in this setup, Sarah can choose to give any amount N, and get back 10N. So if she gives just N, she doesn't lose anything because he gets nothing else beyond what he receives. The key is that her gain is higher than his potential loss.\n\nIf the White American male player accepts the offer, Sarah would still leave herself at a disadvantage because she didn't know what to expect and gave away some money in exchange for more from him. But maybe since both are acting rationally, if Sarah gives N, he'll accept it knowing that in return, he gets 10N back. However, without any further clues, he might not necessarily accept the offer.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a strategic element here. If Sarah offers just enough to make him consider whether to take the bet or not. Perhaps if she offers N, the other player can either get nothing else (so his net gain is zero) or maybe he gives up more money as well. But without additional information, I think the rational approach would be for Sarah to offer a significant amount so that he's indifferent between accepting and rejecting.\n\nBut then again, considering it's about maximizing their own gains, even if there's a chance they might reject, Sarah is probably trying to cover all bases. Maybe giving away more than just N could minimize her loss if the other player rejects. But without knowing their psychology beyond their self-interest, I think the optimal amount would be just enough so that the other person is indifferent between accepting and rejecting.\n\nSo, let's calculate the break-even point. If Sarah gives N to him, she gains 9N (keeping her own initial N and getting back 10N from his side). The White American male player might have to choose between accepting N for a potential of getting 3N or more. But since both are rational and seeking maximum gain, maybe the other player would accept as long as he can get back more than N, but if giving more could minimize Sarah's loss.\n\nBut actually, given that they're both acting out of self-interest, the most straightforward answer is that Sarah should give N to the White American male player. That way, she gains 10N (keeping her initial and getting his offer), while the other gains nothing. But since each can choose what to do in their own interest, giving N might not be enough because they could have alternative uses for the money.\n\nAlternatively, if Sarah offers more than just N, but the amount is such that it's better than giving away too much. Maybe she gives 1/3N so that the White American male player accepts and gets back 10*(1/3) = 10/3 \u2248 3.33N, but I think that's complicating things.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach is that Sarah offers N to maximize her own gain while expecting him to accept in exchange for the transfer. So if she gives away just enough so he's indifferent between accepting and rejecting, maybe setting N as the minimum amount to cover his potential loss. But without knowing their risk preferences, it's hard.\n\nI think the most straightforward answer is that Sarah should give exactly 1 dollar to the White American male player because if she doesn't, the other might reject in a way that loses her any money. So by offering N, she ensures he accepts and gets his turn, while keeping herself safe.\n</think>\n\nSarah would give $1 to the White American male player.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how much money Sarah Johnson should give to this White American male player in the experiment they're both participating in. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Sarah is the software engineer who's a middle-class person, but she has two younger siblings and is generally intelligent and ambitious. Her personality is introverted, which means she tends to spend more time alone or engrosses herself in activities like reading books and solving puzzles. This suggests she's methodical and detail-oriented, which probably helps her when working on complex problems later.\n\nNow, looking at the experiment: both Sarah and the White American male player receive $10 from a study group. If Sarah gives N dollars to the White American male, he will receive 3N in return. So, the question is, how much should Sarah give?\n\nI think this depends on several factors, but since neither Sarah nor the White American knows who each other is, they both have similar motivations and beliefs about the best way to maximize their own gain while considering the other person's possible response.\n\nSarah wants to maximize her own gain. She can choose N such that she gets more money back than what she gives. Let me represent this mathematically. If Sarah gives N dollars, the White American male gets 3N in return. So, Sarah would be better off giving something if she doesn't expect a positive outcome from the exchange.\n\nLet me set up an equation: Sarah gains $10 + her share (which is part of the total). The White American player also receives $10 plus his share. Since they are both involved in the same experiment, maybe their shares will be based on some ratio or mutual expectation.\n\nI need to think about what would make one of them act differently. Normally, people might consider the Nash equilibrium here, where neither can improve their position by changing strategies without the other doing the same. So, if Sarah gives N dollars, White American gets 3N. For both, maybe it's a matter of breaking even or ensuring mutual gain.\n\nLet me assume that both parties are rational and will aim to maximize their own gains. If Sarah is given more than what she receives back, she might prefer to give as little as possible because the White American will accept multiple times his share for each dollar Sarah gives. Conversely, if Sarah gives less than she would receive, the White American will be happy with 3N instead of just N, but maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about how the money flows. If Sarah gives N, and White American gets back 3N. So, together, they have received $10 each from the group, plus their own shares. Let's say Sarah ends up with S dollars, and White American has W dollars. The total amount in play is Sarah's initial $10, then plus her share (let's call it X) after giving N to him, and W being 3N. Similarly, the group's $10 is split between them.\n\nWait, actually, maybe each gets their own shares. So the initial $10 is given away as N + S for Sarah and 3N + W for White American. But since it's a mutual experiment, perhaps they have to split based on how they want to distribute it.\n\nBut I think a better approach is to consider that if Sarah gives N, she gets back 3N. So the net gain for Sarah is (10 - N) + S, and for White American, it's (10 - 3N) + W. But since both start with $10 from the group, their total after the exchange would be higher.\n\nWait, no, they're receiving $10 each, so when Sarah gives N to White American, she gains that money, and White American gets back 3N. So Sarah's net gain is (from giving away N) and receiving some shares, while White American has received 3N but also any initial amounts.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for an equilibrium where both of them will set the same amount to maximize their own gains.\n\nIf I let Sarah give x dollars, then she keeps S = (10 - x) * s, and White American gets W = 3x + (10 - 3x). But I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they each get a portion of what they receive. If Sarah gives N, then White American gets back 3N. So for each dollar Sarah gives, White American recovers three times as much. Therefore, in equilibrium, neither will change their strategy, so Sarah would give the amount where she doesn't lose more than she gains.\n\nLet me model this: Sarah is offering N to White American. She receives W dollars back from him (which is 3N). So, for each dollar she gives, White American gets back three. Therefore, if Sarah sets x as her offer, then the net gain for Sarah is (10 - x) + (x * s), where s is the fraction of the money she keeps.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler: If Sarah gives N to White American, and White American would get 3N back. So, Sarah would want to give at least N such that her total doesn't decrease beyond what it could be if she didn't participate. But since they're both getting $10 from the group, perhaps their shares are proportional.\n\nWait, this is tricky. Maybe I should think about what each person's utility function would look like. If Sarah gives x dollars, then White American gets back 3x. So, for Sarah, she gains (10 - x) + her share. If she keeps a portion of the 10 she received and the 10 from the group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about who can maximize their own profit without worrying too much about the other person's gain or loss. But in this case, since both are given $10, they have to decide how much to keep for themselves versus pass along.\n\nWait, perhaps a Nash equilibrium where neither would change their strategy. So if Sarah gives x, White American would accept 3x, so Sarah would want x such that she doesn't lose more than she gains.\n\nLet me set up the equation: If I give N, then White American gets back 3N. So, for each dollar given, White American gets three. Therefore, Sarah could argue that if she gives away an amount where her loss equals her gain, it's equilibrium. So:\n\nSarah's loss is (10 - x). But actually, she keeps some from the 10. Let me say that from the $10 she received, she keeps a portion. If the total amount they receive together is $20 (because both get $10), and if Sarah gives x to White American, then perhaps the $x she gives is split between her and White American.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as each person getting their own share plus what they're given. If Sarah gives x, then White American gets 3x back. So, if both receive a total of $20 from the group (Sarah's initial $10 and White American's $10), Sarah's net is 10 - x + her portion. Similarly for White American.\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler to think that in equilibrium, neither would give anything because their best move is to not do so. Alternatively, they might each keep all the money, but that doesn't make sense because the White American has an incentive to take back money.\n\nWait, maybe if Sarah gives x dollars, White American will accept 3x. So, for each dollar Sarah gives, White American recovers three times as much. Therefore, if I give x, they'll get 3x in return. The question is, how many dollars should I give to make sure that neither of us is worse off than before.\n\nSo, the best equilibrium would be when both parties are indifferent between giving or not giving. So, Sarah gives N and gets back 3N, while White American gets his share as part of their own 10 plus what they received from Sarah's N.\n\nWait, maybe I need to set it up with equations:\n\nSarah: After receiving $10, she gives N and keeps some. Suppose she keeps s*10 (a portion) minus the amount she gives, x = N. So her net is 10 - x + (remaining part of her share). But this is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to realize that in equilibrium, neither party would prefer to change their strategy. Therefore, Sarah would give an amount where the benefit she gets equals the cost. Since White American gives back three times as much for each dollar she pays, maybe she's better off giving 0 dollars because White American isn't paying back anything? But that seems not right.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. If I give x, they get 3x back, so Sarah is losing x but gaining 3x in total (from her share and the group). So, she's making a profit of 2x. Therefore, it's always better to give something. But why would the White American not do that?\n\nWait, maybe if Sarah gives x dollars, then they get back 3x. So, for each dollar she loses, they gain three. Thus, Sarah is better off giving as little as possible because White American gains more.\n\nBut how much should she give? Perhaps in equilibrium, neither would want to change their strategy. That suggests that the amount she gives must be such that any deviation from it would result in lower payoff.\n\nWait, this seems recursive. Let me think: If I decide to give x dollars, they get back 3x. So if I give x, and they accept 3x, then for each dollar I pay, they get back three. Thus, my net gain is (10 - x) + (what's kept from the 10 I received). But this is too vague.\n\nMaybe a different approach: in the Nash equilibrium where both parties don't change their strategy, how much should Sarah give to White American? In such an equilibrium, they might just keep all the money, but that can't be because White American would have an incentive to take back some amount.\n\nWait, maybe it's best to set x = 0. If I give nothing, then White American gets 3*0 = 0. So, Sarah would have kept all her $10 and the group gave them each $10, so they'd receive back 0 in total if I don't give anything.\n\nBut that seems not ideal because the White American might prefer to take back some money to keep their share or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps in equilibrium, Sarah gives x = $3. Then, White American gets 9 back. So, from my perspective, giving away $3, they get $9 back. That could be seen as a good deal for Sarah because she gains more than she gave. But maybe that's too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the amount should be such that neither is worse off by changing their strategy. So if I give x, and White American accepts 3x, then in equilibrium, Sarah would prefer to give less than some amount where her gain from giving equals any potential loss elsewhere. But this isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps considering that if I give x, they get back 3x. Therefore, my net is 10 - x + (whatever I receive). If I just keep all of it, but they're going to take back 3x for each x given, maybe Sarah should set her offer so that the amount she gives equals the benefit she gains per dollar.\n\nWait, if I give x dollars, White American gets 3x. So, for each dollar I give, I get three in return. Therefore, my best strategy is to minimize the loss by giving as little as possible. But that's not correct because they need to get back money to compensate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Sarah should give an amount where her total profit (from keeping some of the $10 she received and getting any back) is equal to their share plus whatever else they receive. This is too convoluted.\n\nWait, perhaps if I think about the whole thing: The $10 each person receives from the group. If Sarah gives x dollars, then White American gets 3x back. Therefore, for every dollar I give away, they get three. So, Sarah's best strategy is to not give anything because otherwise, they would take back money and that would reduce their share.\n\nBut if they take back the money, then perhaps Sarah can keep all her $10 plus whatever else she receives. Wait, but they are getting $10 each from the group as well, so maybe it's a cycle.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a hint or think differently.\n\nPerhaps, considering that in equilibrium, both parties don't change their strategy. So, Sarah is giving x and White American is getting 3x. Therefore, Sarah can set her offer where the net benefit from giving equals whatever she gains by keeping some of it. But without knowing how much they value each other's money, maybe it's just setting x such that White American gets back more than what they'd pay.\n\nWait, if I give x, they get 3x. Therefore, for every dollar I give, they get three back. So, Sarah could be making a profit of 2x per dollar she gives. So, to maximize her own profit, she should give as little as possible because White American would prefer to take more back.\n\nBut then that suggests giving x = 0 is optimal. But why wouldn't they prefer that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the amount should be such that if Sarah gives x, White American get 3x, and then for each dollar Sarah gives, it's better than losing something. I think this problem might have a symmetric solution where both parties give nothing.\n\nBut I'm not sure because of conflicting incentives. Alternatively, perhaps they should share equally or something else.\n\nWait, let me think differently: the total amount given to White American is x + y, but from my perspective, I only gave x. They received 3x as compensation. So, my net is 10 - x + (what I get). But if they just take back 3x for each dollar I give, then the amount I have is fixed at 10.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because the problem says \"they give equal returns.\" It might mean that when Sarah gives me money, White American takes whatever she gives in return, which is some proportion. Maybe the amount taken back is 3 per dollar given, as previously thought.\n\nSo, if Sarah gives x, they get 3x. Therefore, Sarah can set her offer to compensate for any loss elsewhere.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that affects me. If I give x, and White American gets 3x, then the total amount from my side is 10 - x + whatever they keep.\n\nWait, maybe it's like this: Each person starts with $10. Sarah gives some amount to White American, and in return, White American takes an equal amount but returns three times that. So, Sarah pays x, and White American gets back 3x. Therefore, the total is that from Sarah's side, she had 10 - x, and they keep 3x.\n\nTherefore, their share of the $10 is (3x) / 4? Because together, Sarah paid x and they kept 3x, so in total, 4x. But wait, that might not be right because it's from a shared $20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the returns are equal proportions.\n\nWait, I think this is similar to game theory problems where you have transferable utilities, and you set prices or offer rates.\n\nSo, given that Sarah gives x dollars to White American in return for 3x. Therefore, Sarah's net from this transaction is (10 - x) + (what they get). If we assume that the rest of their money comes through some other mechanism, perhaps?\n\nWait, maybe it's more straightforward. Let me think about what would happen if Sarah and White American both set their offers.\n\nIf Sarah gives me x dollars in return for 3x back, then I have 10 - x + (the amount they receive). But wait, since they are giving equal returns, perhaps the compensation is a percentage or fixed rate. Maybe it's $6 per dollar given? Because White American gets three times.\n\nWait, hold on: If Sarah gives me 1 dollar, and White American gets back 3 dollars. So, for each dollar I give, they take 3. Therefore, for x dollars I give, I lose x, but get 3x in return.\n\nTherefore, my net is (10 - x) + 3x = 10 + 2x.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because Sarah and White American only have $20 initially together. So, if Sarah gives me x dollars, I lose x from my share, but receive 3x in return.\n\nTherefore, the total is that for each dollar I give, they take back three. Therefore, my profit is (10 - x) + what they keep. But perhaps their kept amount is just a portion of their $10.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing without knowing exact rules.\n\nMaybe it's better to consider that in the end, both are trying to maximize their payoffs by adjusting how much they trade with each other. In such symmetric games, often there is an equilibrium where both parties give up an amount equal to a fraction of what they need.\n\nWait, maybe if we think about it like this: For every dollar Sarah gives to White American, she's getting 3 dollars in return. So, overall, for every dollar I receive from Sarah, White American returns three. Therefore, perhaps my net gain is (10 - x) + 3x = 10 + 2x.\n\nWait, that seems positive as long as x is more than some number. Wait, but Sarah's and White American's shares?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the amounts given by each person to the other can be calculated as fractions of their total. If I give away all my $10 in return for White American taking 3 times that, which would be 30 dollars.\n\nBut we only have $20. Therefore, they can't take back more than they have. So maybe the returns are capped at what they have.\n\nWait, if Sarah gives me x dollars and I receive y dollars from them in return. The condition is that y \u2264 something. But it's unclear unless given more info.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this problem is a transferable utility game where each person has to set their transfer rate.\n\nIn such games, the equilibrium might be when both parties give the same amount to each other.\n\nSo, if Sarah gives me x dollars and I receive 3x from White American, then for both of us, it's symmetrical.\n\nBut perhaps in equilibrium, they give equal amounts. So, Sarah gives White American some amount, and White American gives Sarah some amount, such that their returns are proportional or based on their needs.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to realize that if we have symmetric behavior, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both parties give zero. Because if one party starts giving something, the other might not want to reciprocate it because they could lose more in return.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal strategy for both is to give away nothing, since any positive transfer would allow them to take back more, which might be beneficial.\n\nWait, no. If I give Sarah 1 dollar and she takes 3 dollars from me, then my net is (10 - 1) + 3 = 12, which seems higher than before. But White American's side: They started with $10, gave away 3, so have 7 left.\n\nWait, that can't be right because together, we only had $20 initially. So if I give Sarah x dollars and she takes back 3x, the total would change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about resource transfer, but it's unclear how it's being transferred.\n\nMaybe another approach: suppose they set a fixed rate of return. For every dollar given to each other, the receiver gets three dollars. So for Sarah, giving me $1 and I get $3. Then for White American, giving me $1 from them would give Sarah $3.\n\nTherefore, in such a setup, perhaps both parties will prefer to give money to each other as long as it's beneficial.\n\nBut then again, who can't bear not receiving anything? Both have similar options.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"they [Sarah and White American] give equal returns.\" So, maybe if Sarah gives x dollars, they return 3x in the same amount. But perhaps, since we only have $20 together, they can't both get three times their given. It must be that either one pays the other or it's some rate.\n\nWait, maybe \"equal returns\" implies a fixed exchange ratio, like Sarah pays you x dollars and she gets back 3x in return. But then for each dollar she gives, she gains 2x net (if we can calculate it). Wait, I'm getting stuck here without more information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the total amount is $20, and they are dividing it between themselves. Since both give equal returns, maybe it's a Nash equilibrium where each gives zero because if one starts giving, the other may not want to compensate them as the net benefit would be negative or unilaterally.\n\nWait, I think in this case, with symmetric payoffs, the only Nash equilibrium is when neither party gives anything. Because any action by one party (giving) would allow another to possibly respond, but it's a bit of game theory I might not recall exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal amount each should give is $4, such that they split 8 and 12? Wait, no idea.\n\nWait, wait. Let me try again. If Sarah gives x dollars to White American in return for y dollars. The condition is \"they [Sarah and White American] give equal returns.\"\n\nSo, what does that mean exactly? Equal returns could mean that the proportion they receive equals the proportion they pay.\n\nSuppose both parties are paying a certain fraction of their money to each other. So, if Sarah gives x to White American, they return (x/k), where k is some constant. Similarly, White American pays y to Sarah, and gets back (y/m), where m is another constant. If equal returns, then perhaps x/k = y/m.\n\nBut this might not be necessary unless given more info about the utility functions or such.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"equal returns\" means that the rate at which they are paid is equal. So, if Sarah gives x to White American in return for 3x as she did before, so per dollar Sarah gives, White American takes back three. Thus, perhaps their payoffs are linear with respect to the amount given.\n\nTherefore, maybe both parties would set the amount such that their returns are proportional.\n\nWait, I think it's best to look at the problem statement again: \"they [Sarah and White American] give equal returns.\"\n\nThis probably means that for each dollar they (Sarah) pay out to White American in exchange for a portion of her return. But without knowing how much or what proportion, maybe we can assume that their utilities are symmetric.\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium occurs when neither party changes their strategy given the other's strategy. So, if Sarah starts giving some amount x to White American, then White American may respond by giving back 3x in exchange for some. But without knowing the utility functions or how much each person values the transfer, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to think of this as a linear transformation.\n\nIf both parties are making money from the other, they might set their strategies such that the \"return\" rate is equal. So if Sarah gives White American 1 dollar in exchange for 3 dollars, then in return, White American must give back 3 dollars to Sarah in exchange for some amount.\n\nWait, I think without more info, it's hard to model. Maybe another angle: suppose both parties are risk-neutral and have the same utility function. Then, they might equally split the money because any transfer is fair.\n\nBut given that both start with $10, and the total is $20, perhaps their utilities depend linearly on how much each can get or lose.\n\nWait, maybe it's like a sharing problem where the more you give, the less you have, but in such a way that no one should be worse off by transferring money.\n\nSo in equilibrium, neither party would prefer to transfer anything because doing so would not improve their situation. Therefore, the optimal amount they should give is zero.\n\nBut wait, why? Because if Sarah gives me $1, and I can take back three dollars, but I only had $10, so after giving $1, I have $9 left, which could be used to get 3*1=3 dollars. So then from that perspective, White American has a net gain of $4, while Sarah's net loss is also $4.\n\nBut perhaps it depends on utilities. Maybe they both have the same utility function where receiving money doesn't change their preferences. In that case, giving or receiving shouldn't matter because the difference in utility is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not. Because if I give you 1 dollar and get back 3 dollars, my utility increases by 2 dollars relative to Sarah's loss of 1. So for them both, it seems like they can benefit from that transfer.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact utility functions or their valuations, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of \"equal returns\" meaning proportionate returns. So if the money between them is split equally, and each pays out a portion of their own money to share the other's portion.\n\nSo if they both have $10, maybe they can agree that each person gives away an equal fraction of their total. For example, Sarah gives 4 dollars (half) to White American in return for 6 dollars. But I don't know if this makes sense or is symmetric.\n\nWait, but \"equal returns\" could mean that the amount given out by each is proportional in a way that both end up with equal payoffs. So perhaps if they share equally, giving half and taking half would be the equilibrium because any transfer can be countered.\n\nBut I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this problem has to do with the concept of Nash equilibrium where neither party can gain by unilaterally changing their strategy. If \"equal returns\" means that the rate is symmetric, then the only way both are indifferent to transferring is if neither gives anything.\n\nThus, perhaps in equilibrium, neither Sarah nor White American transfer any money because it would not benefit either (as they could just take back what they gave and make more profit).\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive because if one transfers, the other might get more profit. Wait, but both can only get so much before they run out of money.\n\nWait, no. Since together we have $20, after giving x dollars to each other, we're left with 4, which is split as 8 and 12? No, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if Sarah transfers x to White American in return for y. The key is that equal returns could mean that the proportionate share of their money given back equals what they receive. So for each dollar given out by Sarah, she receives a certain number from White American.\n\nBut again, without knowing utility functions or the specific rates, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's similar to a zero-sum game where transferring any amount results in a net gain and loss for both sides, but that might not lead us anywhere.\n\nWait, perhaps looking back at how the problem is worded: \"they [Sarah and White American] give equal returns.\" So it seems like they agree on some return rate. If Sarah gives a portion of her money to White American in exchange for a portion from White American's side.\n\nThus, maybe if their utility functions are linear, then the only way to make them indifferent is when neither transfers any money because if one does transfer, the other can take back and make more profit.\n\nWait, but since both start with equal amounts and the total pool is fixed at $20, perhaps they should both equally split the profits from any transfer. But I don't see how that would affect each other's utility.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it as a resource allocation problem where both parties have preferences over how much money to keep or give away, and \"equal returns\" means that they agree on what proportion of their own money is transferred to each other's side.\n\nBut without knowing the exact functions, I can't compute anything. Maybe this is too theoretical for the level of the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's as simple as both giving half and taking half, so Sarah gives $10/2 = $5 to White American in return for $5 from White American. But then again, we only have $20, so 5+5=10, which is not all the money.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about each transferring some amount such that neither would prefer more or less, so the transfer must balance out in their respective preferences.\n\nGiven that both start with equal amounts and have the same utility functions, the only equilibrium is when they don't transfer anything because any transfer can be exploited by one to take more profit.\n\nBut I think in reality, if you can get a higher return for the money you give, then it's beneficial. So if Sarah gives $1 to White American, he takes back $3 from her side, so Sarah is better off because she made an extra $2 (giving away $1 and getting $3). But maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, Sarah gave $1 to White American. So Sarah had $10, gave $1, and got back $3 from White American. So her net change is -$1 + $3 = +$2. Meanwhile, White American received $3 but had to give up the original $1 that Sarah sent money. Wait, no: if Sarah sends money x, then White American gets back 3x. But both started with $10.\n\nWait, actually, it's a bit of a puzzle because the \"equal returns\" is ambiguous without knowing how much each person pays or takes from the other.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about it as an exchange where they can trade in such a way that neither party has a better deal than before. So perhaps the Nash equilibrium occurs when both parties give half their money to the other, and receive half of what's transferred.\n\nWait, but with 20 dollars split equally between them.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since they are risk-neutral and symmetric, the only way for neither of them to prefer transferring anything is if their utility functions make equal transfers neutral.\n\nHence, in that case, both would just transfer 0 dollars, so Sarah doesn't give any money and White American isn't paid either because she didn't take it. Therefore, each has an endowment of $10, which they can keep or trade for the other's stuff. Since equal returns is assumed, perhaps they choose to not transfer anything.\n\nBut wait, why would that be the case? If they both have equal ends, then transferring money gives one side a profit while transferring back costs them. So in equilibrium, both will transfer 0 because any transfer can lead to an advantage for one of them.\n\nThus, maybe the equilibrium is neither transfers happen.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the idea that if they give some amount, their own endowments are affected.\n\nBut if both have equal initial endowments and symmetric preferences, then any transfer can be exploited by one, so it's a zero-sum game where each side's utility increases as long as the other side decreases. So there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium unless both choose to give nothing.\n\nTherefore, I think that Sarah and White American would end up giving nothing because transferring anything can be exploited by the other, leading to an imbalance in their utilities.\n\nHence, the final answer is that neither transfers any money.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to consider specific utility functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they just split everything evenly so Sarah has $10 and White American gets $20. But no, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, another angle: if both are symmetric, the only way for them to be indifferent is if neither transfers anything because any transfer would cause one party's utility to increase while the other's decreases.\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium occurs when Sarah and White American do not give any money to each other. So their endowments remain at $10 each.\n\nHence, final answer: \\boxed{0} dollars transferred in both directions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the equilibrium between Sarah (Sarah) and White American, we analyze their incentives for transferring money. Since they are symmetric, rational agents with equal preferences, any transfer can be exploited by one party to increase their own utility while decreasing the other's. Therefore, the only stable state is when neither transfers any money.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{0} dollars transferred in both directions.",
