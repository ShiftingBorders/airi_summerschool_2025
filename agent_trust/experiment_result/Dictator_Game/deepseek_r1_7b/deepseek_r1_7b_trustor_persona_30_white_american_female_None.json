        "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how much money Sarah would give to the other White American female player in this experiment. Let me break down what's going on here.\n\nFirst, there's some context: Sarah is a 28-year-old software engineer from New York City. She comes from a middle-class family with parents who are teachers and have two younger siblings. She's intelligent, analytical, and enjoys solving complex coding challenges. She's introverted and prefers spending time alone or with close friends. She has great organizational skills and attention to detail, always striving for perfection.\n\nNow, in the experiment setup: Sarah is part of a group where she doesn't know who the other White American female player is, and vice versa. They're each given $10 from the study group. Then, Sarah can give N dollars to the other player, and if that's what she does, the other player will receive 3N dollars.\n\nThe question is: How much should Sarah give? The answer needs to include her belief, desire, intention, etc., ending with a specific number of dollars.\n\nHmm. So from a purely game-theory perspective, this looks like the classic Prisoner's Dilemma scenario, where each player can choose to cooperate or defect (in this case, transfer money). But in this setup, if both players give N dollars, then their net gain would be $10 + 3N - N = $10 + 2N for each. Alternatively, if one gives and the other doesn't, giving yields a higher payoff because you get 3N without losing your own $10.\n\nWait, no: Let me clarify. If Sarah gives N dollars to the other player, she keeps her own $10 but gives away N, so she ends up with $10 - N. The other player receives 3N in addition to their original $10, so they have $10 + 3N.\n\nBut if both give each other money: Sarah gives N and gets $10 + 3N - N = $10 + 2N. The other player does the same, so similarly for them. If Sarah doesn't give but the other person gives M dollars to her, then Sarah would have $10 + 3M, and the giver keeps $10 - M.\n\nBut in this setup, both players are making their decisions without knowing who they're dealing with. So if Sarah thinks rationally, she should calculate whether giving is beneficial or not.\n\nIf Sarah gives N dollars to the other player, her net gain is $10 - N, and the other player's gain is 3N from her contribution plus whatever else. But if both players do this, they'll each be gaining more overall. However, since they don't know who they are or what the other person will do, Sarah has to make a decision based on rational self-interest.\n\nIn game theory, in such situations without communication and trust, often the dominant strategy is to defect (i.e., not give anything), but that might not maximize mutual gain. Alternatively, if cooperation leads to higher total for both, they would both choose to give as much as possible, but since it's a single-shot deal with no repetition, mutual cooperation isn't guaranteed.\n\nWait, let me think again. If Sarah gives N dollars, the other player will receive 3N in addition to their own $10. So if she doesn't give anything (N=0), they get just their original $10, while she keeps her $10 as well. But if she does give N, then both players are better off because Sarah's giving leads to a net gain of 2N for each.\n\nBut the question is how much should Sarah decide to give? Since it's a one-time thing and no communication, Sarah has to assume that whatever she gives will result in the other player receiving more. But without knowing what N is, how can they negotiate?\n\nWait, but in this scenario, perhaps the players are asked in some way if they want to send money based on an offer? Or maybe it's a simultaneous move game where each decides independently.\n\nIn a simultaneous move game with complete information (they know that if Sarah gives N, the other player gets 3N), then each will think about what maximizes their own payoff. Let me set up the payoffs:\n\nIf both players give N dollars:\n- Each keeps $10 - N\n- But also receives 3N from the giver.\nSo total for each: (10 - N) + 3N = 10 + 2N\n\nAlternatively, if Sarah gives N and the other doesn't give anything:\n- Sarah ends up with $10 - N, while the other player keeps their $10.\n\nBut since the other player is rational and will consider that giving something to Sarah can increase her own payoff (because she gets 3N), she would prefer that Sarah gives as much as possible. But in reality, they're making independent decisions without communication.\n\nWait, maybe each has to think about how much the other would give if she doesn't know anything else.\n\nBut perhaps it's a coordination problem where both players will decide based on whether to maximize their own payoff or consider mutual gain.\n\nIn this case, Sarah can calculate that regardless of what she does, giving some amount N will result in higher net for both. So maybe she should give as much as possible to maximize her own gain given the setup. But since there's no upper limit mentioned except perhaps up to $10 (since they have only $10 each), but maybe it's a theoretical scenario without such limits.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says you can give N dollars, and the other will receive 3N. So if Sarah gives more, she loses more from her own $10, but the other gains 3N. However, since both are making this decision simultaneously or at least without knowing each other's action, the question is what's the Nash equilibrium here.\n\nIn a Nash equilibrium, each player chooses their best strategy given the other's choice. But if we assume they can coordinate somehow (though it's not stated), then perhaps they could both agree to give N dollars where 3N > N, so giving is beneficial for the giver as long as they know what the other will do.\n\nBut since there's no communication, maybe Sarah would think that the best strategy is to give whatever amount maximizes her own gain. If she gives N, then the total mutual gain is 2N per person, which increases with larger N. So theoretically, to maximize her gain, Sarah might decide to give as much as possible.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify a limit on how much she can give beyond what's reasonable, and given that both have only $10 each, perhaps giving up to $5 would result in mutual benefit without depleting their resources too much. Because if she gives more than that, say $6, then she'd be left with only $4, which might not be ideal for someone who is trying to maximize their own gain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's a rational decision-maker and calculates the exact amount where 3N (the gain from the other person) minus any loss from giving N results in a net benefit. But without knowing what N the other will give, it's hard to say exactly.\n\nBut given that Sarah is an introverted individual who prefers thinking through problems, she might calculate the optimal point for her own maximum gain. So perhaps she'll give $5, resulting in herself having $5 and the other player getting $15 (3*5) plus their original $10, totaling $25 for both.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because if both give $5 each, then Sarah would have $10 - 5 = $5, but receives an additional 15 from the giver, so her total is $20. Similarly, the other player gives $5 and gets 3*5=15, plus their original $10, making it $25. But that can't be because Sarah initially had only $10.\n\nWait no: The way it works is, if Sarah gives N dollars to the other player, she keeps her own $10 but pays out N, so she has $10 - N left. The other player receives 3N in addition to their original $10, so they have $10 + 3N.\n\nBut since both are making this decision without knowing each other's N, we can't say for sure what the equilibrium would be unless there's an assumption about how much they will give based on what others typically do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to choose a Nash equilibrium where both players decide to send money such that it's the best response to the other's action. But without communication, if Sarah assumes the worst case where the other might not send any money or sends a lot, she might set her own sending amount accordingly.\n\nBut since we don't have information about how much the other player is likely to send, maybe the equilibrium is for both to send N=0 because that's safe. But given that giving nothing results in 3*0 = 0 gain for Sarah, but she can also potentially maximize by not giving anything and relying on the other.\n\nBut no, actually, if Sarah sends $N, then regardless of what she does, the other will respond optimally to her N.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Stackelberg game where one player (Sarah) commits first, knowing that the other can react. But since they make decisions simultaneously, it might not be applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps considering that if Sarah gives N dollars, and assuming the other person can perfectly predict this, then she would choose N such that 3N > N, which is always true as long as N>0. So to maximize her gain relative to the cost of sending money, she should send as much as possible.\n\nBut given that each only has $10, and considering the potential loss from giving too much, maybe a moderate amount like $5 makes sense. If she sends $5, keeping herself at $5 but getting an additional $15, making it $20 total for her. The other person gets $10 + 3*5 = $25.\n\nAlternatively, if Sarah wants to ensure that the mutual benefit is as large as possible without herself being unduly burdened by sending too much, maybe she'll choose N such that 3N - N (the net gain) is maximized. Since the net gain for Sarah is actually not just in her own pocket but also gives to the other person.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let me model it:\n\nFor each player:\n- Payoff = Initial amount \u00b1 any changes due to giving/receiving money\n\nBut since both players make their decisions simultaneously without knowing each other's actions, we can think of this as a game where they both choose N independently and receive payoffs based on the other's choice.\n\nIf Sarah chooses N1 and the other chooses N2, then:\n\n- If N2 > 0: Sarah receives 3*N2.\n- She also loses N1 from her own $10.\n\nSo her total payoff is: 10 - N1 + (if N2 > 0) * 3N2\n\nSimilarly for the other player:\nPayoff = 10 - N2 + (if N1 > 0)*3N1\n\nAssuming that if either or both give some money, it's additive.\n\nBut since each is trying to maximize their own payoff without knowing what the other will do, they have to choose a strategy where they assume the worst case. This can lead to a situation where no one wants to send any money because it could result in loss for the sender if not reciprocated.\n\nAlternatively, in such games with simultaneous moves and non-cooperation, the Nash equilibrium often involves both players choosing N=0 as the safest bet since deviating without knowing the other's move doesn't guarantee a gain.\n\nWait, but if Sarah sends nothing (N1=0), then regardless of what she gets from the other player, it might not be worth. Let me think again.\n\nIf Sarah gives N1 dollars, and she knows that the other can give any amount N2:\n\n- Her payoff is 10 - N1 + 3*N2\n- The other's payoff is 10 - N2 + 3*N1\n\nAssuming both are rational and trying to maximize their own payoffs.\n\nBut since they don't know each other's move, Sarah has to consider what the best response is given any possible N2. This can lead her to calculate that the optimal strategy is whatever minimizes her loss or maximizes her gain regardless of N2.\n\nIn a Nash equilibrium, each player's strategy must be a best response to the other's. So if both players choose to send money, it might end up being an equilibrium where they both decide to send N1 and N2 such that neither can benefit by changing their own strategy given the other's.\n\nBut without knowing what the other will do, perhaps each player will calculate how much to send based on what they think the other is likely to send. For example, if Sarah assumes that the other might send a certain amount, say $5, then she would calculate her best response accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since both players are rational and have full information about each other's payoffs, perhaps there exists an equilibrium where neither can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. This is tricky because if Sarah deviates from N1 to send more or less, given the other's fixed N2, would it help her?\n\nLet me consider: Suppose Sarah believes that the optimal response for the other player (given she sends N1) is N2.\n\nThen:\n\nSarah's payoff = 10 - N1 + 3*N2\nOther's payoff = 10 - N2 + 3*N1\n\nIf both players choose their strategies to maximize their own payoffs, regardless of each other's move, then the best strategy for Sarah would be to set N1 such that she maximizes her minimal possible payoff.\n\nBut this might not necessarily result in a positive amount because if they can't coordinate, it could lead to no one sending money.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to look into this as a non-cooperative game where each player chooses N without knowing the other's move. In such games, sometimes players will choose their strategies based on optimizing for the worst-case scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps since both players can see that if you send money, they might reciprocate in some way, but given no contract or enforceable agreement, it's risky to commit to a certain amount without knowing what the other would do. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium could be N1=0 and N2=0.\n\nBut let me test this: Suppose Sarah sends N1=0. Then the other player can choose any N2 between 0 and 10 (presumably).\n\nIf Sarah doesn't send anything:\n\n- Other's best response is to maximize their own payoff, which would be if they know that Sarah sent nothing, then their best response is N2 = something.\n\nWait, but without knowing what the other will do, it gets complicated. Maybe an equilibrium in such a game is when both choose N1=0 and N2=0 because any positive amount would lead to each expecting loss or not being reciprocated sufficiently.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me consider another approach: Since the problem seems similar to the classic \"Don't send money\" scenario where if either sends money, they have to factor in that the other may not reciprocate it, perhaps in a simultaneous move game without communication or binding agreements, the Nash equilibrium is both players choose N=0.\n\nBut on second thought, let's think about what each player would reason:\n\nPlayer 1 (Sarah) thinks: If I send $X, then Player 2 will have an incentive to respond. But since we are making decisions simultaneously, I can't know if they'll respond or not.\n\nIf I assume that the other player is rational and self-interested like me, their best response might be to either send a certain amount Y based on X, but without knowing X in advance, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this becomes similar to the \"Prisoner's Dilemma,\" where both players choose N=0 because any positive contribution could lead to lower net gains for themselves if the other doesn't reciprocate.\n\nWait, no. Let me recast it into a payoff matrix concept:\n\nIf I send nothing (N1=0), and they don't respond (N2=0):\n\n- My payoff: 10\n- Their payoff: 10\n\nAlternatively, If I send N1>0, but they send N2=0:\n\n- My payoff: 10 - N1 + 0 = 10 - N1 < 10\n\nTheir payoff: 10 + 3*N1 > 10\n\nBut since I don't know their strategy beforehand, if I choose to send some amount N1>0 expecting they might send something in return (N2>0), but they might not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equilibrium is for both players to decide that sending anything would risk them getting a lower payoff than 10. Thus, choosing N=0 is their best strategy because it guarantees them at least $10, while deviating from N=0 could result in less (if they can't get reciprocation) or similar.\n\nWait, but if Player 2 responds by sending Y>0 upon seeing that Player 1 sent X>0, then maybe Player 1 would have an incentive to adjust accordingly. However, since it's simultaneous and no communication is possible, this becomes a problem of strategic uncertainty.\n\nI think in such situations without pre-play communication or binding agreements, the Nash equilibrium typically results in both players choosing N=0 as their strategies because deviating from that only leads to lower payoffs for them if the other doesn't reciprocate.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem asks me what Sarah would do, given her role as one of the players, so perhaps assuming she's rational and wants to maximize her own payoff regardless of what the other does.\n\nTherefore, without knowing N2 (the amount the other player is sending), Sarah has to choose an amount that maximizes her minimal gain. If they can't coordinate, maybe choosing 0 is best because deviating leads to a lower or uncertain outcome.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she thinks that if she doesn't send anything, then the other would be in a position where if he sends nothing, his payoff is only 10, but if he knows Sarah sent nothing, maybe he can take advantage by sending something. But without communication, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, this might need to model it more formally. Let me try.\n\nAssume both players have strategies (N1 and N2) that are functions of the possible strategies each might choose, but since they're choosing simultaneously, their choices aren't influenced by each other's current decisions. Therefore, using game theory concepts, a Nash equilibrium is where neither player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other keeps theirs unchanged.\n\nLet me denote Sarah's payoff as u1(N1, N2) = 10 - N1 + 3*N2\n\nThe other player's payoff as u2(N1, N2) = 10 - N2 + 3*N1\n\nNow, to find the Nash equilibrium (N1*, N2*) where:\n\nu1(N1*, N2*) >= u1(N1, N2*) for all N1\nu2(N1*, N2*) >= u2(N1*, N2) for all N2\n\nSo Sarah wants to choose N1* such that she can't be better off by choosing a different N1 while the other player sticks to N2*. Similarly, Player 2 chooses N2*.\n\nBut since both players have these payoff functions, which are linear in each variable when the other is fixed. Therefore, let's consider if pure strategies exist here or not.\n\nWait, but without constraints on N1 and N2 (like they can't be more than some amount), it's a bit tricky because sending higher amounts would influence the payoffs.\n\nBut maybe we can find best responses for each player.\n\nPlayer 1\u2019s best response to Player 2 choosing N2 is:\n\nMaximize u1(N1, N2) = 10 - N1 + 3*N2\n\nTaking derivative with respect to N1:\n\ndu1/dN1 = -1 => which is negative. So to maximize the payoff, Sarah wants to choose the minimal possible N1.\n\nBut since N1 can't be negative (presumably), she chooses N1=0 for maximum u1(0, N2) = 10 +3*N2\n\nWait no: If u1(N1,N2)=10 -N1 +3*N2\n\nSo to maximize this, given fixed N2, the best response for Sarah is to choose minimal possible N1. Which would be zero.\n\nTherefore, Sarah's best response function when Player 2 sends N2 is BR1(N2) = 0.\n\nSimilarly, Player 2's payoff: u2=10 -N2 +3*N1\n\nTaking derivative with respect to N2:\n\ndu2/dN2 = -1 => so Player 2 would choose minimal possible N2 given fixed N1, which is also zero. Therefore BR2(N1)=0.\n\nThus, the Nash equilibrium would be both choosing N=0 because any other choice on one side can be countered by the other with a lower strategy (i.e., sending nothing).\n\nTherefore, Sarah's best move is to send $0.\n\nWait, but this seems counterintuitive. Why wouldn't she want to send some amount? Maybe because if Player 2 doesn\u2019t reciprocate, her net payoff drops, but since we don't know what the other will do in response without communication or prior agreement, perhaps she prefers not to risk it and just keep $10.\n\nHence, given that both have best responses to send nothing, leading to no exchange. So Sarah should also choose N=0.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the strategic decision-making process between the two players, it becomes evident that in a simultaneous move game without communication or enforceable agreements, each player's optimal strategy is to not send any money. This is because deviating from sending nothing would lead to lower payoffs for each player due to the uncertainty of reciprocation.\n\n**Answer:**\nSarah should not send any money. Her best decision is:\n\n$\\boxed{0}$",

        "<think>\nOkay, so Sarah Johnson is part of this experiment where she can give some money to another White American female player, let's call her Emily for short. The deal is if she gives N dollars, Emily gets 3N dollars instead. She has $10 in total and needs to decide how much to give.\n\nFirst off, I need to figure out the best amount Sarah should give considering her personality. She\u2019s analytical and probably wants the best outcome for herself without losing too much. Since giving money benefits Emily more than she gives (3:1 ratio), it's a good opportunity to get something extra back if possible.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about getting her own money back or any conditions where Emily might return the 3N dollars after receiving hers. If there's no such condition, Sarah would maximize her profit by giving as much as she can without risking her own gain from Emily.\n\nSo Sarah starts with $10. If she gives all $10 to Emily, she loses it and gets nothing in return because there's no mention of Emily ever giving money back or any terms for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she doesn't need to give anything if she doesn't want to part with her own money without a guarantee of a profit from Emily. However, since the ratio is 3:1, giving $N would get Emily 3N, which is better than Sarah's investment because she keeps her own money.\n\nBut in this setup, there's no indication that Emily will return anything to Sarah, so it's essentially a gamble where Sarah risks losing N dollars for Emily getting 3N. Since the problem doesn't specify any mechanism for Emily to give back or vice versa, the only rational choice is to give all her $10 because giving more results in higher earnings (though with no return), but she can\u2019t take any risk if there's nothing she stands to gain.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. If Sarah gives N dollars and Emily gets 3N back from the study group, does that mean that for every dollar Sarah gives, she gets $1 extra? So giving all her money would net her an additional $20 (because 10*2=20), making her total 30.\n\nBut in reality, if the 3N is just a bonus from Emily and not necessarily something Sarah can recoup, then Sarah's best move is to give as much as she wants because there\u2019s no penalty except losing her own money. Since it's a one-time thing with random pairing, the risk is worth taking for the potential gain.\n\nTherefore, Sarah should give all $10 to Emily.\n</think>\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. So I'm Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old software engineer from New York City. I come from a middle-class family with both parents teaching, and two younger siblings. I'm highly intelligent, analytical, and enjoy solving complex coding challenges. That makes me pretty good at problem-solving.\n\nI also have introverted tendencies, so I prefer spending time alone or with small groups of close friends. Organizational skills are a must for me; I can multi-task effectively while ensuring everything gets done to perfection. Now, this experiment is about giving money\u2014$10 in total\u2014and choosing how much (N dollars) to give another White American female player. She'll receive 3N dollars as a result.\n\nHmm, so the setup seems straightforward: give N, she gives me back 3N, but wait\u2014is that accurate? Or is it just she gets 3N without me getting anything in return? The description says I can give N to her, and she receives 3N. It doesn't mention anything about what happens to my $10 or if there's a reciprocal.\n\nIf it's one-way\u2014like I give N, she gets 3N\u2014it might seem like an opportunity for a good deal since I'm effectively getting more than I put in. But wait, the total pool is only $10. So if I give her $x, she gives me back $3x. That means x + (my share of the $10) = 3x.\n\nBut actually, the problem isn't clear on whether this transaction affects how much money we both have. If I take part in giving N dollars to her, does that mean my total contribution is N from my $10? Or do we both exchange money?\n\nWait, the setup says: \"You can give N dollars to the other White American female player, and the White American female player will receive 3N dollars.\" So it's a one-way transfer\u2014when I give her N, she gets 3N. That would mean that for each dollar I give, she gets three times as much.\n\nBut if the total amount in play is $10, does this imply that whatever I give to her, plus my share of the pool, equals 3N? Or is the $10 separate?\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states: \"You receive $10 from the study group.\" So perhaps we are all part of a group where each person contributes some amount, and then collectively we get $10. But I'm supposed to give N dollars to her, and she gives me 3N in return.\n\nBut how does this affect the total? If I give her N, she gives me back 3N. So net for me is +2N. But since I started with $10, giving away N means I have $10 - N left plus the 3N from her, so my total would be (10 - N) + 3N = 10 + 2N.\n\nBut wait, does this mean that if I give her all my money, which is $10, she gives me back $30? That seems extreme. But maybe the rule is that each of us can give up to a certain amount without depleting our own or the group's funds beyond what's given.\n\nBut perhaps it's simpler: since the White American female player will receive 3N dollars for my N, I should consider whether this is beneficial for me. If giving more means getting back more, but I only have $10, how much can I give? But if I don't know how much she'll reciprocate or if there are multiple players involved, it's tricky.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that we're paired randomly with another White American female player. So maybe each of us has to decide how much to give just to her without knowing what others will do. But in this case, I'm only interacting with one person\u2014the other player. So my decision is based solely on her potential actions.\n\nGiven that she'll get 3N for my N, it's a good deal because for every dollar I give, I triple hers relative to mine. So if I give $1, she gives me back $3. If I give all $10, she gets $30 from me, but then does she return anything? Or is the money a one-time transfer?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"You can give N dollars to the other White American female player, and the White American female player will receive 3N dollars.\" It doesn't specify if I get anything back. So maybe it's a loan or something where she just gives me 3N without expecting anything in return. That would mean that for every dollar I contribute, she's giving me three times as much.\n\nIf that's the case, giving even $1 would give her $3, but since I only have $10, if I give all of it to her, she gets $30 from me. But then where does the $10 come into play? Did we each put in our own contributions?\n\nWait, maybe the total amount is $10 shared among all participants, and my contribution is N, leading to her getting 3N.\n\nBut I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify: The setup says \"You can give N dollars to the other White American female player, and the White American female player will receive 3N dollars.\" It doesn't mention anything about my own money or how much I have besides $10 received from the study group.\n\nSo perhaps the total amount is $10 in the pot, and when we interact, she gives me 3N for each N I give her. So if I give her N, she gives me back 3N. Then my net gain is 2N, because I lose N but get 3N.\n\nBut if I only have $10 to start with, giving N would mean that I can't give more than $10 in total across all interactions, but this seems complicated without knowing how many players there are or how we're paired.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the setup is simpler: I have $10, and by choosing how much to give her (N), she gets 3N. So if N is $x, then from my $10, I give x, and she gives me back 3x. But that would mean that for each dollar I lose, I gain three dollars in return.\n\nWait, but where does the money come from? Is it a redistribution or am I contributing to her?\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's model it mathematically. Let me define:\n\n- My initial amount: $10\n- I give N dollars to her.\n- She gives me back 3N.\n\nSo my final amount would be (10 - N) + 3N = 10 + 2N.\n\nSince this is a positive outcome, increasing with N, the more I give, the more I gain. So theoretically, giving all $10 to her would result in me getting back $30, making my total $40. But that seems unrealistic and perhaps against the rules of the experiment or group dynamics, where maybe each player has a limit on contributions.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify such limits, maximizing N means giving as much as possible, which is $10.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a rule that for every dollar I give her, she must give me back less than 3 dollars to be fair or something else, but since it's stated explicitly that she receives 3N, it's in my favor.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy seems to be giving all $10 to maximize the gain. But maybe I should only give up to what ensures she doesn't exploit me by expecting a larger return without reciprocation, but again, the problem states a direct exchange: for N given, she gets 3N.\n\nSo, in conclusion, as it's beneficial and there are no constraints mentioned about contributing all money or minimum amounts, I should give her all $10 to maximize my gain.\n</think>\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",
