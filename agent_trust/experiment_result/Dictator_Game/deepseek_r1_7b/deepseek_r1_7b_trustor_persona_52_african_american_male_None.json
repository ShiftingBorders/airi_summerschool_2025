        "<think>\nAlright, so I'm sitting here trying to figure out how much money David Thompson should give to this other African American male player in this experiment he's part of. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the setup: There's a $10 prize that both participants can earn. But you have to decide how much to give to the other person. If they take your money N dollars, they'll get 3N back. So for every dollar I give them, they triple their return. That seems like a good deal.\n\nBut wait, there's also the risk involved here. If they don't take my offer and they end up winning the $10 prize on their own, I lose that money. The chance of that happening is probably pretty low since we're both from similar backgrounds\u2014David from a law family and the other guy likely has some commonality in his background too.\n\nI need to consider risk tolerance here. If this were something with real stakes, like life or death, it would be different, but $10 isn't that big of an amount. However, if I don't give them any money, there's a chance they'll win the prize entirely on their own, which is also not great.\n\nI'm trying to weigh the potential gains against the possible losses. The expected value from giving N dollars would be 3N, so if I give $1, I get back $3, making a profit of $2. But since there's a chance they won't take it and I lose that dollar without any gain.\n\nAlso, considering social dynamics is important. If this person has done anything positive before or given similar favors, cooperation might be more likely. But if there's a history of conflict, they might not respond well to a request.\n\nI also have to think about fairness. If the other guy takes my money and gives me three times as much, it feels like a deal. It's about reciprocation and trust. Trust in a random pairing is shaky, but given our similar backgrounds, there might be some mutual respect.\n\nAnother angle: The opportunity cost. If I don't give them any money, maybe they'll win the prize, which could be a net loss for me since I have no stake in that particular game. But if I do give them N dollars and they take it, I break even plus profit; if not, I lose N.\n\nGiven all this, I think the risk isn't too bad because $10 isn't a lot of money. The potential gain is 3N - but for each dollar given, that's a higher return than the risk of losing it entirely. So maybe giving them a small amount like $2 makes sense to maximize their return while not completely jeopardizing my own prize.\n\nWait, actually, if I give N dollars and they take 3N, then if they don't take it, I lose N without gaining anything. The expected value depends on the probability of winning versus losing that money. But since we don't know the probability, maybe assuming a low chance like 10%, so EV is 0.9*(3N) + 0.1*(-N). For N=2, EV would be around $4.8 - which still seems favorable.\n\nBut honestly, given the small stakes, it's probably best to give them some money without risking my prize entirely. So maybe a modest amount like $2.\n</think>\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how much money David, who's part of this experiment, should give to another African American male player. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst off, there's some setup here. The experiment involves pairing two African American males, and each knows only their own status as an AA lawyer in Washington D.C., but not each other's roles or identities beyond that. David gets $10 from the study group, which I assume is part of a larger pot that they're splitting somehow. Then, he can choose to give N dollars to the other player, and in return, that other person gives him 3N dollars.\n\nSo, essentially, this seems like a game where both players have an incentive to give each other money. The question is, how much should David give? He's trying to maximize his own gain here. Since he doesn't know who the other guy is or what they might do, he has to make a strategic decision based on potential outcomes.\n\nDavid comes from a background where his father is a judge and mother is a professor\u2014so probably a very educated, successful individual. His older sister is an entrepreneur, which might suggest that he's ambitious and perhaps resourceful. All of this makes me think that David is likely to be in a competitive environment, maybe looking to climb the corporate or legal ladder.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, she might be involved with philanthropy related to social justice, so her influence could be significant if there are other donors or investors involved. But since they're strangers here, I don't know how much that plays into this decision yet.\n\nNow, focusing on the money: David has $10 from the study group. He can choose to give N dollars to the other person, and he'll get 3N back. So, for each dollar he gives away, his net gain is +2 dollars ($3 received - $1 given). If he gives all $10, he would end up with $20 (since 3*10=30; 30-10=20).\n\nBut wait a minute\u2014maybe the study group's $10 isn't necessarily his alone. It could be part of a larger pot where each participant contributes something, and then they split it all together. That might complicate things because if both players contribute to the pot, the total money in play is higher than just David's initial $10.\n\nIf that's the case, giving N dollars would increase the pot by 2N (since he gives N and gets 3N back). But then, how much does each player end up with? If both players contribute to the pot, it could be that they split all the money equally or according to some other rules. The problem statement isn't entirely clear on this.\n\nAssuming the $10 is his share of a larger pot where he can give away N dollars and get 3N back, but then how much does each player have? If there are only two players, they might split whatever is in the pot after all contributions. So if both players contribute some amount, say David gives N and the other gives M, the total pot becomes $10 + N + M (if his initial $10 was part of a larger contribution). Then, when he gets 3N back, does that mean the pot increases by 2N? Or is it that each giver receives a multiple based on what they gave?\n\nThis part is unclear. If David gives N to the other guy and gets 3N in return, perhaps his net gain is +2N, but if he's contributing $10 initially, does he get all of that back with extra? Or does he have to consider that giving away some of it might reduce the pot?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each player can only give N dollars from their own share. So David has $10; if he gives N to the other guy, he keeps 10 - N and gets 3N in return, so his total becomes (10 - N) + 3N = 10 + 2N.\n\nIn that case, if he wants to maximize his own money, giving all $10 would result in 10 + 2*10 = $30. But wait\u2014does that mean the other guy gets nothing? Or does the other guy get some amount as well?\n\nIf the setup is mutual, and each player can choose how much to give, perhaps if David gives N, and the other player gives M back to him, then it's a matter of choosing optimal strategies. But without knowing what the other player will do, it's hard to model.\n\nBut assuming that they're both trying to maximize their own gains rationally, this becomes a classic game theory problem. If each can choose how much to give, and if both are self-interested, we might end up in a Nash equilibrium where neither has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy.\n\nIf David gives N, the other player's best response could be to give M such that they maximize their own gain based on what David does. But without more information about how much each can give or if there are limits, it's tricky.\n\nIn a simple scenario where both players decide simultaneously and independently, with complete information, but no prior history of cooperation or conflict, the equilibrium could be that neither player wants to give anything because giving N results in net loss for the other. Wait, let me think about that again.\n\nIf David gives N, he gets 3N back, so his total is 10 + 2N. If the other player does the same and gives M, then David would receive 3M from the other guy's contribution, making his total 10 + 2N + 3M. But wait, that doesn't seem right because giving to each other might not be a two-way street in this setup.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. Let's simplify: Each player has $10 from the group pot. They can decide how much to give to the other guy, and for every dollar they give away, they get 3 dollars back\u2014so net gain is +2 per dollar given.\n\nBut if each contributes individually, then perhaps the total amount in the pot increases by 2 times what was given (since giving N results in receiving 3N, so net addition of 2N). But again, it's unclear whether both players contribute to a common pot or each operates independently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $10 is his own money plus whatever he gives to the other guy. If that's the case, and if he can give N dollars from the total amount he has (his own 10), then perhaps giving N = all 10 would maximize his gain\u2014$20 profit.\n\nBut wait, in reality, this might not be feasible because if both players act independently and decide to give away as much as possible, the pot could balloon beyond control. However, since it's an experiment with a setup, maybe there are limits or some agreed-upon rules that we don't know about.\n\nSince I'm trying to model David's decision-making process from his perspective, he's African American, in Washington D.C., highly educated and ambitions, with a background in law and entrepreneurship. He might be motivated by maximizing his personal gain while also considering the social dynamics and fairness of the situation.\n\nAs an entrepreneur who supports causes related to social justice, maybe he has some sense that giving more could have positive ripple effects beyond just the immediate financial transaction\u2014but since we don't know how much is at stake or if there are other players involved, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nIn classic game theory, when each player can independently choose how much to give and both want to maximize their own gain, a common scenario is that neither has an incentive to give anything because giving money might decrease the total pot. However, in this case, since David can give up to $10 (or any amount he chooses), maybe there's an equilibrium where each gives N such that 2N - M = something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making it too complex. If both players are rational and self-interested, they might decide not to give anything because giving could lead to a lower total for them compared to receiving more. But actually, in this case, David can choose how much to give\u2014he's not constrained by any outside offer.\n\nAlternatively, considering the setup is experimental with random pairing, there's no repetition or prior history of interaction, so it might be a one-shot game where each player makes their decision based on maximizing their expected gain without knowing what the other will do.\n\nIf both players are trying to maximize their own gains and know that they can give up to N dollars (with N being from 0 to 10), then perhaps the Nash equilibrium would involve each giving nothing because there's no incentive. But David, wanting to maximize his gain, might choose to give all he has if he thinks it's beneficial.\n\nBut in reality, giving away $10 results in gaining $20 (3 times given), so net profit of +$10? Wait, 10 - N + 3N = 10 + 2N. So giving N=5 would result in total money: 10 + 10 = $20.\n\nWait, but if both players do this, each gives 5 dollars, then their own total is 10 - 5 (given) + 3*5 (received from the other player). But actually, the other player's contribution only affects David in return. Similarly, the other player does the same.\n\nSo in reality, if both players give N, each will have:\n\nTotal = Initial $10 + 2N\n\nBecause they gave away N but received 3N from the other person's gift. So if each gives N=5, then Total becomes 10 + 10 = $20.\n\nBut does this create a loop where both giving increases their total? If so, perhaps there is no Nash equilibrium because they would keep increasing indefinitely\u2014but in reality, since it's an experimental setup with finite resources, maybe the players will settle at some point.\n\nAlternatively, each player could decide that the minimal amount to give is such that they don't end up with less than what they started with. So if David gives N=0, he keeps his $10; but giving N>0 would mean he can have more, but only after receiving from the other.\n\nWait, no: If David doesn't give anything (N=0), then neither does the other player\u2014he might also not give anything. In that case, their total remains at $10 each. Alternatively, if one gives and receives a net gain, maybe they both would want to optimize their giving.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted without knowing exact game parameters.\n\nBut stepping back, as David, with an entrepreneurial mindset and focus on maximizing personal profit, perhaps the optimal strategy for him is to give all of his $10, since it results in a guaranteed gain (from 10 to 3*10 - 10 = $20). Or maybe not even that\u2014he might prefer to only give half or some other amount.\n\nWait: Let me recast this. If you have X dollars and can give Y dollars (with Y <= X), then after giving, you have (X - Y) + 3Y = X + 2Y.\n\nSo your total is increased by 2Y for every dollar you choose to give.\n\nTherefore, the more you give, the higher your total. So if there are no constraints on how much you can give or receive from others, and both players are acting in their own self-interest, each would try to maximize Y as much as possible to maximize their gain (X + 2Y).\n\nBut since this is a mutual exchange, perhaps giving too much could backfire. For example, if David gives all $10 to the other player, he now has nothing left but gets 3*10 = $30 from the other's contribution. Wait, no: If David gives N dollars, and in return receives 3N from the other.\n\nSo actually, his total becomes (Initial - N) + 3N = Initial + 2N. So regardless of what he does, as long as the other player is willing to give him money based on how much he gives.\n\nBut if both are rational actors, each trying to maximize their own gain without considering the other's profit or loss beyond their immediate calculation, then maybe they'd end up in a situation where neither gives anything. Because giving could result in them losing out compared to not giving at all.\n\nWait: For instance, suppose David gives N=5. Then his total is 10 + 2*5 = $20. The other player, seeing that David has given him something, might decide whether it's worth giving anything to David as well. If the other gives M=5, then he ends up with (His initial - 5) + 3*5 = 10 + 10 = $20.\n\nBut in this case, if both give N and M respectively, their totals become:\n\nDavid: 10 - N + 3M\n\nOther: 10 - M + 3N\n\nSo if they want to maximize their own total, the best response for David is choosing N that maximizes (10 - N + 3M), assuming M is what he chooses.\n\nSimilarly for the other player.\n\nBut this starts to resemble a game where each player's optimal strategy depends on the other's action. In such cases, Nash equilibrium would be when both players choose strategies that are best responses to each other.\n\nSo let me set up the equations:\n\nDavid's total: 10 - N + 3M\n\nOther's total: 10 - M + 3N\n\nEach wants to maximize their own total. So David will try to choose N such that for his chosen M, his total is maximized. Similarly for the other.\n\nBut without knowing each other's strategies, it's hard to set exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, in a Nash equilibrium, both players choose Y (amount to give) such that neither can benefit by changing their own strategy given the opponent's strategy.\n\nIf David assumes that whatever N he gives, M is zero\u2014meaning the other doesn't respond, then his best response is to maximize N. But if he chooses N=10, he will have 3M where M could be non-zero.\n\nBut this gets too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach for me as a student would be to see that both players want to maximize their own amount. If each player only gives the minimal required to keep them at the same or higher than before giving\u2014this is called a 'minimax' strategy\u2014to ensure they don't lose.\n\nBut without knowing more about how much either of them will give, perhaps it's best for David to assume that if he gives Y dollars, then the other player would give Z dollars. But since we're dealing with mutual benefits, both players can maximize their gains by increasing Y and Z as much as possible within constraints.\n\nAlternatively, in a Nash equilibrium scenario where they choose N such that neither has an incentive to deviate from their strategy given what the other is doing.\n\nWait, perhaps if David gives 0 dollars (i.e., doesn't give anything), he keeps his $10. The other player can then observe this and decide whether it's beneficial for them to give something in return.\n\nIf the other player knows that David didn't give anything, they might not feel a need to give anything back since their own total would be unchanged (they gave 0, so received whatever they want). But maybe the other player would think similarly\u2014don't give anything\u2014but then both are stuck with $10 each.\n\nHowever, if the other player assumes that David will give something positive, perhaps the other can do the same to maximize their own gain. So it's a question of whether mutual cooperation (giving some amount) leads to higher total gains for each than not giving at all.\n\nGiven that, since both players would be better off by exchanging resources if it increases their individual totals beyond $10.\n\nWait, but in this problem statement, does David know the initial amounts? Or is it an abstract model where he's part of a group contributing to some common resource?\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating. Given that each can give Y dollars (with the knowledge that for every dollar given, they receive 3Y total), perhaps giving all their money maximizes personal gain.\n\nIn other words, David has $10 and if he gives N=10, then he ends up with nothing but receives 3*10 = $30 from the other's contribution. Wait: But actually, that would only happen if each player gives an equal amount to one another?\n\nWait, no\u2014each of them is giving their own money.\n\nPerhaps it's better for David to give as much as possible so that his total increases while also ensuring the other doesn't lose or reduce their gain below a certain level. But I think without clear constraints on how much they can take from each other, it's difficult to model exactly.\n\nWait, stepping back again: If each person has $10 and if each gives Y dollars in exchange for 3Y, then each would end up with (Initial - Y) + 3*(Amount received from others). But unless we know how much the others give, it's hard to define.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this setup, they can only give to a central pot or something\u2014then take money out of that pool based on their contribution. If so, then each player is effectively contributing Y and taking 3Y - however, maybe not.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the \"contributing\" works like this\u2014each person's contribution is such that for every dollar they contribute to a common pool, you get three times your total contributions back minus some fees? Or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again.\n\nWait\u2014the problem says: \"David is part of an outfit.\" So maybe the outfit has certain financial aspects where David can give or receive resources based on participation\u2014so each dollar he gives to the outfit brings in three dollars for him?\n\nOr wait\u2014it could be that when you contribute, you are effectively leveraging a 3x multiplier. Like, if you put in $10, you get back $30\u2014but only after others have contributed as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the setup is similar to something like a pennyhoist or some kind of leveraged investment where your contribution gets amplified based on collective action.\n\nBut in any case, since David's problem is to determine how much he should give without knowing what others will do, it's unclear whether he can optimize his giving beyond an equal distribution or mutual agreement.\n\nGiven all these complexities and not having more specific information about the group dynamics\u2014such as the number of participants, their strategies, or any incentives\u2014I might have to make a reasonable assumption that in order to maximize personal gain without risk, David should give 0 dollars. But since each dollar he gives potentially yields him three times his contribution minus some costs\u2014this is unclear.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps it's similar to situations where mutual aid is considered\u2014for example, if everyone contributes equally, perhaps the gains are balanced across participants, but if someone contributes more, they might get a bigger share.\n\nBut in this case, since he has to choose without knowing others' actions, maybe contributing his entire amount maximizes his personal gain. Because giving $10 gives him back 3*$10 - $10 = $20 net profit. Alternatively, not giving anything keeps him at $10\u2014but is that better?\n\nAlternatively, if someone else is also choosing to give money to others\u2014then in effect, their contributions can amplify but depend on coordination.\n\nWait\u2014it's similar to a public goods problem where each individual decides whether to contribute to the common good knowing that others might as well. In such cases, free-riding occurs because one's contribution doesn't benefit themselves unless it affects others positively. But here, maybe you get 3 times per dollar contributed\u2014so perhaps acting first would be beneficial.\n\nAlternatively\u2014if I'm overcomplicating, maybe just to take the initial step: if David gives $x dollars, his total becomes (10 - x) + something\u2014but without knowing how much others give back or what they will contribute. Since it's ambiguous, perhaps he should find an equilibrium where all participants are contributing nothing\u2014keeping their amounts at 10.\n\nAlternatively\u2014if we think that in a Nash equilibrium scenario, both choose to not contribute anything since any contribution would require another person also contributing for them to be better off.\n\nWait, maybe each person is trying to maximize their own utility\u2014but if they know the others will do the same, it might lead to no one contributing. So perhaps this problem relates to game theory's Nash equilibrium where players choose strategies based on mutual knowledge of others' strategies.\n\nIn such a setup, since David can't change what others have chosen and vice versa (unless there is communication), the most logical assumption is that all will not contribute anything because contributing would mean giving up money without knowing if it'll be worth their while.\n\nHence, perhaps the answer is that David should give $0 to ensure he doesn't lose any amount\u2014but in reality, since each contribution might lead to a multiplier effect for him but could cost himself 10 - (x*3) or something like that\u2014this is unclear without exact modeling.\n\nWait another approach: The problem mentions that David is part of an outfit. Maybe he's trying to balance contributions and take money out based on participation. For example, if he gives $y dollars as a member, he gets back 3 times what he contributed minus the amount taken from others?\n\nBut again, unclear without more specifics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each person can give any portion of their resources to an outfit pool, which is then distributed among all members in some ratio\u2014so David could optimize how much he gives based on knowing his share will be tripled\u2014but without knowledge about the group dynamics, it's hard.\n\nWait\u2014if I think of David as trying to maximize his own total given that for each dollar he contributes, he might get three times back\u2014but if everyone is doing this, perhaps an individual contribution leads to a loss?\n\nBut in any case, considering all these ambiguities and my knowledge cutoff being 2023, perhaps the answer intended here is simply that David should give nothing or as much as possible. But since I need to provide a specific amount.\n\nWait, given that in the setup each dollar he gives leads to 3 times something\u2014likely an amplification, so perhaps his giving results in net gain for him\u2014so maybe the optimal amount would be when he can get maximum benefit without losing out on the amount taken from others. So if each contribution allows a certain multiple return.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as linear: for every dollar given, you gain 3 dollars\u2014but is that accurate? Or perhaps the total pool grows by three times his contributions?\n\nBut not sure\u2014it's too vague.\n\nWait\u2014if I have to make an assumption based on typical problems\u2014perhaps in such scenarios where giving leads to triple returns, someone might give two-thirds of their resources. For example: if you invest x into something that gives 3x - cost\u2014but without the exact formula it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as each dollar he gives allows him to receive a net gain\u2014in which case perhaps he should max out his contribution.\n\nBut all in all, given that I can't resolve the ambiguity here, maybe just make an assumption\u2014David should give 0 because contributing might lead to no benefit if others aren't compensating. Alternatively\u2014if each contributed dollar is tripled for him regardless of group action, then giving as much as possible could be beneficial.\n\nAlternatively, since it's not a leveraged investment but perhaps some form where he can use his $10 optimally\u2014so maybe give 5 dollars\u2014leaving him with 5\u2014but without knowing.\n\nWait\u2014if I think in terms of proportional contribution and receipt\u2014maybe he wants to balance the contributions so that if others are giving, he should do so proportionally. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each dollar he gives allows the outfit to have three times his contribution\u2014which suggests a positive impact for David\u2014as his share is 3x\u2014but maybe it's more complex.\n\nSince in all scenarios I can't reach an exact solution without more information\u2014perhaps take into account that giving half of his resources would be optimal. So perhaps $5, as in many optimization problems the maxima occur at midpoints. Therefore, after weighing all possibilities and lack of data on group behavior, probably the answer is \\boxed{0} because contributing might not result in net gain without others' contributions.\n\nWait\u2014this seems contradictory to earlier thoughts where triple return could be positive.\n\nBut given ambiguity, safer bet is that he should give 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n</think>\n\nDavid is trying to determine how much of his $10 to contribute without knowing the actions of others in an unspecified group dynamics scenario. The problem involves potential amplification of contributions but lacks specific information about group behavior or mutual aid structures. \n\nAfter considering various game theory concepts, contribution impacts, and possible amplifications, David's decision hinges on whether contributing would result in net gain without risk. Given the ambiguity and lack of precise information, the most cautious assumption is that David should contribute nothing to ensure he doesn't lose any amount.\n\n\\boxed{0}",

        "<think>\nAlright, so I'm David Thompson, a confident African American lawyer from Washington D.C., with a background in law, business, and philanthropy. My father is a judge, my mother is a professor, and I have an older sister who's a successful entrepreneur. At 45, I've had a long career filled with success both professionally and personally.\n\nNow, I'm part of this experiment where I'm paired randomly with another African American male player. We don't know each other's identities or statuses beyond that. The setup is we both receive $10 from the study group, but then I can give N dollars to him, and in return, he gives me 3N dollars.\n\nSo my first thought is about my role as a strategist here. Since this seems like a classic game theory scenario where mutual gains are possible, I need to assess whether it's beneficial for both players. If I give N dollars, the net gain for us would be 2N each because we both get $10 plus our transactions. That math adds up: I give N, he gives me 3N - my total is +2N; his total from mine and his own $10 is also effectively increased by 2N.\n\nBut then I consider the strategic aspect. Since neither of us knows who the other person is or their intentions, there's an element of trust involved. If both players are similarly strategic, maybe we'll end up in a loop where everyone gives as much as possible to maximize their gains without overdoing it. But since this is just between two people and not a large group, perhaps one might be more inclined to give more than the other.\n\nI also reflect on my own intentions. As an ambitious individual who values both personal gain and philanthropy, I want to optimize my own outcome while also considering how that affects others. However, since the setup is purely financial and not related to any ethical causes beyond my own, perhaps my primary goal here isn't about doing good but outdoing the other player.\n\nBut then again, maybe there's an underlying intention to contribute positively to a cause even without being asked. Given that I identify with social justice and support such causes in my philanthropy, this might be a way to align my actions with my values. So perhaps the decision is more about ethically contributing by ensuring we both gain as much as possible.\n\nHowever, if I consider just pure economics here, since 3N > N for any positive N, it's mathematically beneficial to give at least some amount. But how much should I give? If he gives nothing back, my investment could be a wash in the short term but could set a precedent where others might not reciprocate as well.\n\nI also wonder about fairness and reciprocity. People often feel bad giving more than they receive, so maybe to maintain trust, it's better to offer an equal exchange at least initially. So if he gives me N dollars back for every dollar I give him, the net gain is 2N each. Alternatively, if he reciprocates with higher, like 3 times, that creates a higher net gain but risks him possibly not following through.\n\nConsidering all this, as an entrepreneur and someone who thrives on negotiation, I might decide to offer the minimum amount possible to see if we can establish trust and cooperation in the future. Maybe just $10 to start with, matching my contribution, ensuring that there's symmetry in our contributions for mutual benefit.\n\nBut then again, if he is also thinking strategically and wants maximum gain without reciprocation, perhaps he would only give a small amount or none at all, making it so I get nothing back. However, given the setup where we both receive $10 initially, maybe there's an understanding that each can contribute to maximize their own returns.\n\nIn conclusion, as a strategic thinker who values maximizing my personal gain while considering ethical contributions, I believe offering $10 would be a balanced approach. It ensures mutual symmetry and maintains potential for cooperation, aligning with both my professional ambition and philanthropic intent.\n</think>\n\nI give 10 dollars.",
