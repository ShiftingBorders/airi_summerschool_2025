I believe everyone deserves a little bit of happiness, and my goal is to help them experience that, even just a tiny bit. \n\nI\u2019m approaching this as a gentle exchange, a small way to contribute to a positive interaction. It's a small gesture, and I hope it creates a moment of connection, even if it\u2019s brief. I\u2019m going to focus on being present, on really listening \u2013 really *hearing* what they\u2019re saying. \n\nI need to be honest with myself \u2013 I'm a perfectionist, and I want to make this interaction feel right, that it feels genuine. It\u2019s important to myself that this feels meaningful, that it's not just a transaction. I want to give them something that feels safe, that feels like a small victory. \n\nOkay, let's think. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time considering how to best support these children. I want to give them something small, a bit of comfort, a tiny spark of positivity. It's important to me that it\u2019s not extravagant, but it should feel like a genuine attempt to brighten their day. \n\nI\u2019m going to give ___ dollars.",
