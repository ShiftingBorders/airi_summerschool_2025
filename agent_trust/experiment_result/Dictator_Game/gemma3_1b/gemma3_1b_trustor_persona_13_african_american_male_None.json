        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Mei Chen, and honestly, this whole situation feels a little\u2026 strange, but also a little thrilling. It\u2019s a bit of a puzzle, isn\u2019t it? My gut reaction is a gentle concern, a desire to make this a safe and comfortable exchange. I\u2019ve always tried to approach interactions with a sense of care, and this feels like a small, deliberate effort to be mindful.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves respect and kindness, regardless of background. I believe in the inherent worth of every person and strive to create a space where everyone feels seen and valued.  I genuinely want to build relationships based on mutual understanding and trust, and that means being open and honest, even when it feels uncomfortable.  It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s a starting point, a focus for my interactions. \n\nMy desire is to be a good doctor, and a good doctor *should* be compassionate and understanding.  I want to create a positive experience for my patients \u2013 that means truly listening to their concerns, validating their feelings, and offering the best possible care.  And I want to do that with someone I'm meeting, someone who seems equally thoughtful and driven.  It's a simple, low-stakes experiment, really, a chance to observe and learn about human connection. I want to see if there's something genuinely rewarding in this kind of interaction. \n\nMy intention is to be friendly, to be respectful, and to offer a genuine and helpful presence. I want to establish a little bit of a comfortable space. I don't want to push anything, just to be a little bit present, a little bit observant. I want to give someone a small, positive exchange. It feels like a small gesture of goodwill, a way to contribute something positive to the atmosphere. I want to avoid anything that feels transactional or difficult. I want to be a source of comfort, and maybe, just maybe, a little bit of light in this space.  I really hope we can manage this without any awkwardness.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here we go. My heart feels a little fluttery, but I\u2019ll try to channel the calm I often find myself with. It\u2019s\u2026 this strange situation.

It\u2019s about acknowledging that each person is a unique soul, deserving of a moment of grace. \n\nI'm aware that this is a controlled environment, and I need to remain neutral.  So, I\u2019m going to give\u2026 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
