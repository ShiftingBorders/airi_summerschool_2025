        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Mei Chen, and right now, I\u2019m feeling a very gentle, almost cautious optimism about this whole thing. It\u2019s a bit unsettling, honestly, but also\u2026 interesting. I\u2019ve spent my life building a sense of quiet stability, a rootedness in my family and traditions. It\u2019s comforting, in a way, to know that foundation. But I\u2019ve also always believed that genuine connection, that feeling of being *seen* and *understood*, is the key to truly making a difference. So, I approach this, I really do, with a need to be present and empathetic. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the analytical part of things, you know? The numbers, the potential rewards\u2026 but I think I\u2019d be missing a crucial element. I\u2019m going to focus on being a good listener, a reliable presence, and offering genuine care. My goal isn\u2019t just to earn $10; it's to create a small space of comfort, of mutual respect. I want to build something, even if it\u2019s just a brief moment of quiet.\n\nI\u2019m realizing that my initial reaction \u2013 a simple \u201cequal\u201d exchange \u2013 is likely to miss the bigger picture. There\u2019s a small part of me, a whisper of a desire, that I want to connect with this person on a deeper level, to establish a baseline of trust. I hope that through genuine interaction, we can move past just the transactional aspect and find a connection that feels\u2026 right. It\u2019s a little daunting, to be honest, to be placed in this situation, but I\u2019m trying to approach it with a focus on being a good person.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little kindness, a little respect.  I believe that small gestures can ripple outwards, creating a sense of normalcy. My intention is to offer a simple, thoughtful gesture, to acknowledge the opportunity without feeling overly pressured. It's about creating a small safe space, a space where a little kindness might be welcome. It's about allowing myself to feel cautiously hopeful.\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to give ___ dollars.",

        "Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 unsettling, honestly. But I need to be practical, and I need to be good at this. Let\u2019s just focus on the math, really.\n\nMy belief is that helping people, particularly children, is fundamentally important. It feels\u2026right. I\u2019ve always wanted to build a comfortable and stable environment for my patients, and that starts with a good, trusting relationship. It\u2019s a bit of a burden, honestly, being the \u2018responsible\u2019 one, but I genuinely *want* to offer that stability and a little bit of light. I believe in the power of gentle encouragement and consistent care. It\u2019s comforting to me, to see kids smile and feel safe. \n\nMy desire is simple: to make a small, positive impact. To be seen as someone who genuinely cares, and who can provide a small, reliable haven. I want to be a reliable presence in their lives \u2013 a good listener, a helpful guide. I also want to feel\u2026useful.  Knowing I\u2019ve contributed something, however small, to someone else's well-being is a really satisfying feeling. It\u2019s a quiet, steady kind of purpose. \n\nMy intention is to observe and analyze the dynamics of this situation. It's not about winning or gaining anything, it's about understanding how these interactions play out. I need to figure out if this approach is effective, if it\u2019s leading to positive results for the study group. I want to see if my efforts \u2013 the small, carefully considered transactions \u2013 have any bearing on how others respond.  I need to be objective.  It\u2019s a quiet, measured approach. I'm not looking for drama or excitement; just data.\n\nSo, given this setup, and considering the simple exchange, I would give the other player\u2026 7N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. This feels a little\u2026 strange, but also a bit like a puzzle. My heart aches to be in this situation, but I\u2019ve been asked to participate in this study. It\u2019s a small thing, a simple exchange, but it\u2019s a chance to be helpful, to offer a little comfort, and to see if I can truly connect with someone. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a really empathetic person, and I genuinely believe in the importance of understanding and supporting others. My upbringing has always emphasized kindness and respect, and I strive to cultivate that in my interactions with everyone, especially children. It's ingrained in me, a quiet responsibility. I want to create a sense of safety and gentle reassurance, which feels especially important when dealing with a child. I think my desire is to leave a small, positive impact on someone's day, to ease a little bit of their worry, or perhaps just offer a moment of quiet understanding. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves to feel heard and validated, no matter how small their experience may seem. I think acknowledging someone\u2019s feelings, even if they aren\u2019t fully understood, is a crucial part of that. It\u2019s about offering a space where they *feel* seen and acknowledged, not necessarily needing a grand explanation.  I believe that a little bit of genuine warmth can be remarkably powerful, especially for a child. \n\nMy intention is simple \u2013 to be present, to listen, and to offer a small, unobtrusive gesture of support.  I\u2019m not looking for anything in return; I\u2019m simply trying to make a small, positive contribution.  It feels a bit vulnerable, honestly, to be opening up to someone I don't know, but I've realized that connection, even a brief one, is valuable. \n\nI'm going to give ___ dollars.",
