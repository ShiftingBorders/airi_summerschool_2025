        "Okay, here goes. This feels a little strange, but\u2026 it\u2019s a really good opportunity. My gut reaction is a little nervous, honestly, but also a thrill. It\u2019s\u2026 unexpected. I\u2019ve always been a bit of a solitary person, and this feels like a chance to maybe, just maybe, connect with someone different. I tend to overthink things, so it\u2019s important to me to be calm and thoughtful. I need to approach this with a level of clarity that I haven\u2019t always possessed, which is why I\u2019m trying to analyze the situation \u2013 not just react impulsively. \n\nI\u2019m going to be honest, I\u2019m a bit hesitant. It\u2019s easy to get swept up in a game, but I want to make sure I\u2019m being generous and giving more than I take. It feels\u2026 like a way to test a bit of my generosity, a small gesture of goodwill, perhaps. I hope it doesn\u2019t feel greedy on my part. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little kindness, even in a game like this. It\u2019s about recognizing that we\u2019re all just trying to survive and thrive, and maybe even a little bit to leave a positive impression.  I believe in the power of small gestures to make a difference, even if it\u2019s just a little bit of generosity. I'm hoping it makes her feel comfortable and a little less alone, which is a good thing. \n\nMy desire is simple: to make this interaction\u2026 pleasant, if possible. I want to be polite and respectful, and make sure my offer feels genuine. I genuinely want to leave a feeling of\u2026acceptance, maybe. I want to let her know I'm not trying to take *all* the money, just\u2026 a little. \n\nMy intention is to be fair, and to not come across as overly eager. I want to appear reasonable and not push my luck. I\u2019m hoping to establish a baseline of respect, and possibly, a comfortable interaction. I also want to look for a subtle way to make her feel like she can handle the situation, rather than having to push back.  It feels like a chance to be a bit thoughtful and not just focus on getting the most out of it. I\u2019m trying to be strategic here, I suppose.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019d give her five dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. This is\u2026 weird, honestly. It\u2019s a bit unsettling, but I\u2019ve got to be practical. My gut feeling is a little anxious, a little cautious. I\u2019ve always been a bit of an observer, a planner, and I\u2019m trying to be as calm as possible. I\u2019m trying not to let my excitement overwhelm me, but there\u2019s a part of me that wants to *understand* this. It feels like a low-stakes game, a way to interact with someone, but the lack of information \u2013 the complete stranger \u2013 is making me a little nervous.\n\nHonestly, my desire is to just\u2026 get through this. To not feel completely overwhelmed by it. I want to be polite, of course, and make a reasonable exchange. I don\u2019t want to come across as pushy or demanding. I need to be respectful of their time, and hopefully, this won\u2019t be a completely awkward experience.  I want to find a balance between being agreeable and not overextending myself. It\u2019s a little daunting, this lack of context. \n\nMy intention is to be fair.  I'll give the most amount of money I can reasonably manage, given the circumstances, without being overly generous.  I want to make it feel like a mutually acceptable exchange. I'm aiming for a steady, manageable amount \u2013 enough to feel like I'm contributing, but not so much that it\u2019s a significant financial burden.  I\u2019m trying to keep it simple, a small, polite gesture. \n\nRight now, looking at this situation, I\u2019m thinking... about how much is *actually* needed to feel comfortable?  And I guess, realistically, I'd give maybe $7.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. This feels a little\u2026 strange, but I\u2019m trying to be calm and focused. Let\u2019s just\u2026 think.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a little anxious, to be honest. It\u2019s a new environment, and I want to make a good impression. I\u2019ve been working hard lately, you know? Building things, really focusing on my work. It\u2019s important to me, it feels like. I want to prove I can be reliable and contribute meaningfully. I want to show that I\u2019m capable, and that I\u2019m a good team player \u2013 even though I actually prefer my own company sometimes. It's just\u2026 a little daunting, you know? I want to feel like I\u2019m *doing* something, contributing to this group. \n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019d give a little bit. Just enough to\u2026 ease the pressure. It\u2019s a small gesture, really. A way to feel a little less isolated, maybe. It's not about extravagance; it\u2019s about a little reassurance, a little acknowledgement that I\u2019m here, and that I'm trying.  It\u2019s about showing a willingness to connect, even if it's just a small, simple thing. I'm hoping it creates a little bit of\u2026 lightness. It feels like a chance to subtly start a conversation, a little nudge towards a shared space.\n\nI want to be polite, and friendly, I guess. Not pushy, just\u2026 present. I want to remember to be respectful of everyone's time, of course. It\u2019s a bit overwhelming, honestly, just to be in this situation. I think\u2026 I think a small amount is a good way to start.  A bit of a buffer, if you will.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
