        "Okay, here goes. This is\u2026 a little nerve-wracking, honestly. It\u2019s kind of a strange thing, being paired with someone I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m trying to keep my head down and focus on the task. \n\nHonestly, I think I\u2019d give $5.\n\nMy belief is that this is just a simple exchange, a little bit of a game. I don\u2019t expect anything profound, just a fair distribution of the money. I believe in honesty and a little bit of luck \u2013 it\u2019s a gamble, really. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m expecting anything special, just a balanced part of the pot. I\u2019m trying to be a good person, you know? \n\nMy desire is simply to get the $10. It\u2019s a small amount, but it feels like a little piece of something bigger, a chance to, well, make a comfortable evening. I\u2019ve been working hard lately, trying to make things a little smoother, and a little bit of financial stability would be nice. It wouldn't be a huge windfall, but it\u2019s a small boost.\n\nMy intention is to be polite and straightforward. I don\u2019t want to draw attention to myself or make anything complicated. I just want to get the money and move on. I want to be seen as someone who is responsible and doesn\u2019t waste anything. It's a little self-preserving, I suppose.  I don\u2019t want to get attached to anyone, just accept the exchange and keep going.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars ",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Sarah Johnson, and honestly, it\u2019s a little unsettling to be standing here, just\u2026 strangers. But this experiment feels like a chance to connect with someone, to maybe find a little bit of a foothold in this city. I\u2019m definitely feeling a bit of a quiet observer, a bit of a planner, and I\u2019ve always valued precision \u2013 like coding, really \u2013 so it\u2019s good to be in a situation where I can make a small, calculated contribution.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little bit of kindness, even in a casual exchange. It feels\u2026 important, honestly. It\u2019s a tiny ripple of positivity in a sometimes overwhelming world. I think people are generally good, but sometimes they need a gentle nudge. \n\nMy desire is simple: to be\u2026 pleasant. To be a little bit friendly and not make anyone feel like they're an inconvenience. I want to feel comfortable and respected, which is why I\u2019m offering a small amount. It\u2019s not about expecting anything, just wanting to create a small sense of goodwill. \n\nMy intention is to be discreet, to not draw too much attention to myself. I want to observe, to listen, and maybe, just maybe, subtly shift the atmosphere around us without being noticeable. I'm hoping to feel a little less lonely, a little more\u2026 connected. It\u2019s a small thing, a tiny bit of currency for a shared space. \n\nI\u2019m going to give you 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. This is\u2026 a little weird, honestly. It\u2019s a bit unsettling, but I\u2019ve got to be honest, I\u2019m feeling a little nervous. My gut\u2019s doing a little flip. It\u2019s a strange thing, this assignment, and frankly, a little unsettling.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think I can really explain it, but\u2026 I think I\u2019d probably give him $7. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a sign of\u2026 something. A small, gentle acknowledgment of our shared space, maybe? It feels like we\u2019re both just\u2026 existing in this situation, a little bit separate. I\u2019m not expecting anything specific, just a small gesture of\u2026 familiarity, I guess. It\u2019s a way to acknowledge the shared context, I think. \n\nMy belief is that a little generosity, a little warmth, could be a nice thing to do. It\u2019s not about *winning* or being the best, it\u2019s about a basic human decency, I suppose. A small acknowledgement that we\u2019re both here, navigating this\u2026 this shared space. It feels a bit like a tiny act of validation. \n\nMy desire is to, at the very least, feel a little less alone. It\u2019s easy for me to feel a little isolated, you know? This kind of interaction, this tiny exchange, feels like a momentary connection.  I want that feeling to linger, even just a little. \n\nAnd my intention is\u2026 well, it\u2019s probably just to be a little kind. A small, quiet kindness. To maybe shift the feeling of\u2026 the weirdness a tiny bit.  I guess I just want to avoid making it all a bit too uncomfortable. It\u2019s a little daunting, this whole scenario, but I\u2019m trying to be as calm and polite as possible. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
