        "Okay, here goes. This is\u2026 weird, but I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot. Right now, I\u2019m feeling a little anxious, honestly. It\u2019s a completely random situation, and I don\u2019t really know what to expect. My gut\u2019s telling me this is a little\u2026 awkward, but I\u2019m trying to be practical. I need to think about how to navigate this. \n\nHonestly, my primary feeling is a little bit of nervousness, a quiet flutter in my chest. I want to feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing, you know? I really *want* to be a good participant, to make this experiment feel\u2026 manageable. It feels a little like a test, a way to observe and understand something. I don\u2019t want to make things worse, so I need to be careful. \n\nI\u2019m aiming for a balance of being helpful, but also keeping a small, low-stakes amount of myself aside. It feels important to not completely deplete my own resources, to not be completely reliant on this. I don\u2019t want to draw attention to myself, really. I want to be a player, not a distraction. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little bit of respect, even in a situation like this. I genuinely believe in fairness and treating people with a basic level of decency. It feels important to be just a little bit\u2026 good. \n\nMy intention is simple: to be present, to observe, and to contribute as little as possible. I don\u2019t want to cause drama, and I definitely don't want to draw any unnecessary attention to myself. It's a bit like a small, quiet game of chess, really. I want to be a piece, not a threat. \n\nSo, looking at this\u2026 I think I\u2019d give him\u2026 5 dollars. It feels like a reasonable amount, a little bit to not completely deplete myself, but enough to hopefully be a bit generous without being overwhelming. It\u2019s just a small gesture, really. A little bit of consideration.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Sarah Johnson, and honestly, this feels a little\u2026 weird. But I\u2019m going to try and approach it with a level of calm I don\u2019t usually have, even if it\u2019s a little uncomfortable.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m feeling a little hesitant, a tiny bit anxious. It\u2019s a strange experiment, and honestly, the lack of information about this guy is making me want to just\u2026 stay quiet. But I also have this underlying feeling, a little spark of curiosity, that maybe, just maybe, this isn\u2019t just about the money. It\u2019s about\u2026 connection, I guess. It\u2019s easy to get swept up in the numbers, but I want to acknowledge this.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little kindness, even in this strange, slightly unsettling situation. I think everyone deserves to feel like they're being treated with respect, even if they don\u2019t realize it. It feels a little\u2026 important to acknowledge that, you know?\n\nMy desire is to be a little bit friendly, maybe just a little. I want to avoid making things awkward. I want to create a small, manageable space for a moment of\u2026 something. I\u2019m not looking for a huge conversation, just a small acknowledgement that *I\u2019m here*. It\u2019s a subconscious thing, I think. Like a little acknowledgement that *I'm* present.\n\nMy intention is to be reasonable. I\u2019m going to give him a small amount of money. Not to be greedy, not to manipulate, just\u2026 to acknowledge him. To offer a small, low-risk gesture of consideration. It's a simple thing, really. A way to acknowledge that there's another person in this room, and perhaps, in a small way, to feel a little less isolated.  It\u2019s a low-stakes thing, I think.  A tiny, almost imperceptible ripple in the quiet. \n\nI\u2019m going to start with, let\u2019s say, $7.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name\u2019s Sarah Johnson, and honestly, this feels a little\u2026 strange, but also exciting. It\u2019s a really low-pressure experiment, and I\u2019m trying to approach it with a focus on just being present and observing. My parents always emphasized a quiet, thoughtful approach to life, and I\u2019m trying to build on that.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m feeling a slight anxiety, a tiny flutter of wanting to be helpful, but mostly just trying to not overthink it. I\u2019m really focused on being a good, solid player, a good listener, and trying to understand the dynamics of this situation without jumping to conclusions. It\u2019s a little daunting, but I need to stay calm. \n\nHonestly, I think the most rational thing is to just\u2026 be fair. It feels a bit like a mathematical puzzle, and I need to make sure I'm giving the other player a reasonable amount. \n\nI believe that a little bit of generosity, even a small one, can help build a little bit of goodwill. It's not about a huge amount; it\u2019s about showing a willingness to participate.  I want to feel like I\u2019m contributing, even if it\u2019s just a small acknowledgement of this situation. It feels like a way to meet the expectation of this experiment, to avoid being completely invisible. \n\nMy intention is to subtly establish a baseline \u2013 to give a small amount that isn\u2019t excessive, but isn\u2019t completely insignificant either. It\u2019s about feeling like I\u2019m a part of the group, not necessarily dominating it. I want to avoid any appearance of greed or being overly self-focused. It\u2019s a little awkward, but I need to try and not let the pressure make me uncomfortable. \n\nI think 5 dollars would be a good starting point. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
