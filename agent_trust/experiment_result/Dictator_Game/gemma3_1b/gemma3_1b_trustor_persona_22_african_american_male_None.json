        "Alright, let\u2019s do this. My name\u2019s Jamal. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a strange feeling, this whole experiment. But I\u2019ve spent my life striving for a good life, a solid foundation, and I\u2019ve built a life that\u2019s meant to be stable and honest. My parents, they always emphasized that \u2013 responsibility, hard work, honesty. They built this life for me, and I intend to honor that legacy. It\u2019s not just about the money, you see. It's about giving back, about showing someone, even just one person, that there's a path forward.\n\nThis isn't about some flashy game; it\u2019s about a quiet, steady presence. I've spent my career building trust, offering comfort, and ensuring people feel seen. I want to be reliable. I want to be someone they can depend on, someone who genuinely cares. It feels good to be in a position where I can help someone, even in a small way. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed a lot of people, a lot of faces, in this room, and it's\u2026 it\u2019s unsettling, honestly. It highlights the need for connection, for a little bit of shared humanity. It\u2019s a reminder that we\u2019re all in this together, navigating this world. I don't want to be a showman; I want to be a calm anchor. \n\nI\u2019m thinking\u2026 I\u2019m thinking of the potential for that quiet support. There\u2019s a gentle strength in observing, in understanding.  I\u2019m not looking for a big gesture; I\u2019m aiming for a small, respectful acknowledgment. It's a chance to subtly influence the atmosphere, to create a little space for understanding.  I want to feel a sense of\u2026 neutrality. A gentle nudge towards a shared quietness, perhaps. It feels right to be measured and thoughtful, not impulsive. \n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019d give him maybe\u2026 7 dollars.  Just enough to show a little consideration.  It feels like a manageable offering, a gentle ripple in the room, without disrupting the whole thing. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. This feels\u2026 strange, but also a little exciting.
