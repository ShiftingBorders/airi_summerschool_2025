        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Jamal Ahmed\u2019s perspective:\n\nRight. This is\u2026 strange, actually. It\u2019s a bit unsettling, this feeling of being thrust into this situation, completely detached from everything familiar. My gut\u2019s telling me this isn\u2019t a game, it\u2019s a test. A test of how I manage stress, how I prioritize. My parents always taught me that responsibility comes with a weight, and this feels like that weight is suddenly doubled.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m feeling a bit of apprehension. It\u2019s not just about the money, though that\u2019s certainly a factor. It\u2019s about\u2026 understanding. I want to be seen as someone who can handle this, someone who doesn\u2019t crumble under pressure. My father always stressed the importance of calm, a steady hand. My mother, a whirlwind of empathy, taught me to always look for the human element in everything. I want to *show* them that, not just *be* that person. \n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about my own goals, you know?  I want to be respected, not just for my medical expertise, but for the way I approach everything. I want to be someone people can rely on, someone who is dependable.  This experiment, this unexpected pairing, feels like a chance to prove that. It\u2019s a little vulnerable, letting someone else know about me, but I need to trust my own ability to remain composed. \n\nI want to be\u2026 generous. It\u2019s not about some grand gesture, not really. It\u2019s a small act of recognition, a little acknowledgement of this chance to *connect*. I want to make her feel like she\u2019s contributing, that her presence, even for a moment, isn\u2019t insignificant. It's a chance to see how she responds to a bit of\u2026 vulnerability. \n\nSo, I think\u2026 I think I\u2019d give her, let\u2019s say, 5 dollars.  It feels right. A little acknowledgement, a little trust. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars \n",

        "Alright, let\u2019s\u2026 let\u2019s just think this through. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a little unsettling, honestly, this whole situation. My father always stressed the importance of treating everyone with respect, regardless of their background. My mother, a rock, always insisted on fairness. It\u2019s a pressure, you know? A lot of unspoken expectations, simmering beneath the surface.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m trying to be calm. I don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions, to say anything rash. My job\u2026 it\u2019s important. It\u2019s about providing care, about making a difference, even if it\u2019s just a small one. I want to be seen as someone who\u2019s reliable, someone who gets things done.  It\u2019s a comfort, a responsibility, to be competent. \n\nI'm a bit hesitant, though. It feels\u2026 strange. This isn't exactly a typical interaction. It feels like a small exchange, a temporary arrangement. I\u2019m not expecting anything extravagant, not really. I want to keep a level head.  My initial instinct is to just\u2026 not think about it too much.  It\u2019s easier to focus on the task at hand \u2013 assessing the situation, understanding the rules, and trying to be as objective as possible. \n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019d offer a small amount. A fair amount, perhaps.  Something that feels\u2026 balanced. It\u2019s a small gesture, perhaps, to acknowledge her presence, without drawing attention to myself.  It\u2019s a way of showing that I'm not going to let this situation dominate my thoughts. \n\nI'd aim for around\u2026 7. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here\u2019s what I\u2019d do, honestly. It\u2019s a bit of a tricky situation, but I\u2019ve thought about it. My belief is that everyone deserves a fair shake, even when things feel a little\u2026unbalanced. I believe in striving for justice, even in a system that sometimes feels rigged. It\u2019s a core part of my approach to medicine \u2013 always looking for the root cause of a problem and ensuring everyone has a chance to heal.\n\nMy desire is simple \u2013 to make this a little easier on both of us. It\u2019s not about a grand gesture, but about acknowledging the fact that this isn't a perfectly equal exchange. I want to feel like I\u2019m contributing a little, a small bit of effort, without expecting anything in return.  It\u2019s about showing a small level of consideration. \n\nMy intention is to be polite and respectful. I don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable or like they're being pressured. I want to proceed calmly and thoughtfully, understanding that this is a test \u2013 a quick, focused exchange.  I\u2019d want to make sure my tone is neutral, not overly eager.  I'm focusing on establishing a baseline level of interaction, a small, comfortable space to begin with.  It's about minimizing friction, really.  I want to be a good participant, and that means being pleasant. I try to approach everything with a sense of dignity, and I\u2019d want to do that here too.  It feels important to treat everyone with respect, regardless of their background, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
