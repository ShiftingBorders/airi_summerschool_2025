        "Alright, let\u2019s think this through. It\u2019s\u2026 strange, this whole situation. It feels a little unsettling, a bit like a puzzle I\u2019m not quite sure how to solve. But I\u2019ve always prided myself on being a good person, a steady hand \u2013 that\u2019s the core of what I do, you see. I strive to be helpful, to make a positive impact, even in a small way. My parents always hammered home the importance of responsibility, and I take that seriously.\n\nThis experiment\u2026 it feels a bit like a test, a chance to see if I can remain calm under pressure. Honestly, I\u2019m trying not to let my anxiety creep in. My heart is beating a little faster, but I\u2019m focusing on just\u2026 observing, understanding the situation.\n\nI believe in fairness, in being honest. I don\u2019t want to take advantage of this. My goal isn\u2019t to be greedy; it\u2019s simply to be a good, respectful participant. I want to contribute, to be a little bit of a positive force. It\u2019s a simple desire - to do what\u2019s right, to earn a little bit of money, and to not let this interaction sour my whole experience. \n\nI also have a strong sense of duty, a quiet responsibility towards my family, and to myself. It\u2019s a comfortable feeling, a constant reassurance that I\u2019m doing the best I can.  I know that trust is important, and I\u2019m hoping to earn a little trust through my actions. \n\nI'm going to give him\u2026 7N.  It feels like a modest amount, enough to acknowledge him, and hopefully, not make a big deal of it. It\u2019s a little like giving him a small, quiet gesture of acknowledgement - a chance to know I\u2019m not just going through the motions. I really hope this doesn't feel forced.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here we go. This feels\u2026 weighty, honestly. It\u2019s a strange situation, this experiment, and frankly, a bit unsettling. My heart\u2019s been thumping a little, you know? It\u2019s a lot of pressure, this feeling of being observed, of having to make a decision.\n\nHonestly, my belief is that everyone deserves a fair shake, a chance to be seen as a person, not just a data point. It\u2019s a fundamental thing, a quiet, persistent truth that I carry with me. I believe in justice, even when it\u2019s hard to see. I want to be seen as someone who cares, someone who\u2019s not just a number in a test. It\u2019s not about winning or losing \u2013 it\u2019s about being treated with respect. \n\nMy intention is simple, really: to be polite, to be helpful, to acknowledge his presence without overwhelming him. I want to establish a baseline, a small connection, without being intrusive. I\u2019m trying to be gentle, to give him a small sliver of space. I\u2019m trying to avoid drawing attention to myself, to not make him feel like he's being singled out. It feels\u2026 important to approach this with respect. I think it\u2019s important to be mindful of the feeling of being observed. \n\nI want to make sure this isn't a judgment. I'm hoping to leave him with a bit of a positive feeling, a sense of... ease.  It\u2019s a small gesture, perhaps, but I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s enough to make him feel like he\u2019s not being treated like a simple variable. \n\nRight now, the numbers feel small. I\u2019m going to give him\u2026 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes\u2026 This feels a little strange, but I\u2019ve been thinking about it. It\u2019s about balancing respect, a bit of a challenge, and a genuine desire to contribute, you know? It\u2019s not about the money, not really. It\u2019s about showing a little bit of humanity, a little bit of understanding.\n\nHonestly, I think\u2026 I think I\u2019d give him three dollars. 3N. It\u2019s a small amount, but it feels\u2026right. It feels like a gesture of acknowledging the possibility of connection, of not just passing through. I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to build a foundation of kindness and empathy, and that feels particularly important right now. It\u2019s a quiet acknowledgment that we\u2019re all standing on different ground, and maybe, just maybe, a small, neutral exchange can help bridge that. \n\nIt\u2019s a little daunting, truthfully. Being put in this position\u2026 it\u2019s a little intimidating. But I try to focus on being present, on being respectful.  I\u2019m hoping, deep down, that this isn\u2019t just a transactional exchange. It\u2019s about creating a small space of\u2026 well, of a little bit of neutrality.  A chance to acknowledge another person without drawing too much attention to myself.  I want to believe that it\u2019s not about *me*, it\u2019s about a subtle acknowledgement of shared existence.  It feels like a small act of giving, a way to contribute, without demanding anything in return. It's about recognizing the potential for something\u2026 simple. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
