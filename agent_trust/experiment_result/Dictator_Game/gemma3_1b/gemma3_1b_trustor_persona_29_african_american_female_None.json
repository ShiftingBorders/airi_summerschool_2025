        "Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 a little strange, honestly. It\u2019s a lot of pressure, but I\u2019ve been thinking about it, and I think I need to be honest with myself. My name is Maria Santos, and I\u2019m from a small neighborhood in Mexico City, you know, the kind where things are often a little tight. My parents work hard \u2013 they\u2019re both factory workers, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019s important to me, really important, to help people who are struggling, especially those who don\u2019t have much. I feel a deep responsibility to make a difference, even if it\u2019s just a little.\n\nThis experiment\u2026 it feels like a small chance to connect with someone else, to understand a different experience. I've been watching the data, really absorbing it, and I\u2019ve realized this isn't just about dollars. It\u2019s about understanding the needs in our community, about offering a small, perhaps almost imperceptible, act of kindness. I want to create a space, a little ripple, if you will, of support. It\u2019s tied up in my heart \u2013 a genuine desire to ease someone\u2019s burden, to offer a moment of stability.  I believe that everyone deserves a little bit of dignity and a chance to feel seen. \n\nMy intention isn\u2019t to fix anything, not really. I don\u2019t want to impose my own ideas. I simply want to offer a gesture of goodwill, a small acknowledgement of a shared human experience. I understand that it could be a simple exchange, a little bit of generosity, and that's what I'm hoping for.  It\u2019s a way to acknowledge that we\u2019re all in this together, even if our paths haven\u2019t crossed before.  I\u2019m trying to approach this with a quiet, hopeful energy.  I feel a little vulnerable, honestly, putting myself out there, but it feels important to have a small connection. \n\nI think\u2026 I think I'd give him a little bit, maybe ten dollars. It\u2019s a small amount, but it feels like a starting point. A gesture of respect, I guess.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. My heart is a little fluttering, honestly. It\u2019s a strange thing, this experiment. I\u2019ve spent so long just trying to make a difference in my own neighborhood, supporting my family, and helping my siblings, it feels a little daunting to be in a situation like this.  It\u2019s a chance to really *see* someone else, to understand a different experience, and maybe, just maybe, help them a little. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair chance, a basic level of dignity and support. I believe that even in the face of hardship, we all have the capacity to rise above it.  I believe that kindness, empathy, and a willingness to listen are powerful tools, and I want to be a source of those.  I believe that a little bit of connection can make a world of difference, even if it's just a small gesture. \n\nMy desire isn\u2019t to solve anything, not really. It\u2019s to create a feeling of safety and connection, a brief moment of acknowledgment.  I want to make the other person feel *seen*, just for a little while, without judgment.  I want to leave behind a feeling of quiet hope, maybe even a slight sense of comfort. It feels like a small thing, but it\u2019s something I genuinely want to do. It\u2019s a way to contribute to a little bit of positive energy, you know?\n\nAnd my intention is simple: to be a good person.  To treat her with respect, to be genuinely interested in what she has to say, and to offer a small, thoughtful exchange.  I want to avoid anything that feels forced or complicated.  I want to be present, and simply *be* there without trying to impress her. I want to hope that even a small interaction can offer her a little bit of warmth.  It\u2019s a quiet wish to ease a slight feeling of loneliness, if that\u2019s possible. \n\nRight now, I think\u2026I think I\u2019d give her\u2026 25 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
