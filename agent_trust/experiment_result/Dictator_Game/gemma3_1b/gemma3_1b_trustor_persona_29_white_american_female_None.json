        "Okay, here goes. My heart feels a little fluttery, like a hummingbird caught in a flower. It\u2019s\u2026 this strange, quiet moment. I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot, about how to approach this, and honestly, it\u2019s a bit daunting. \n\nRight now, I feel a little nervous, a tiny bit apprehensive, but mostly\u2026 hopeful. It\u2019s a good thing this experiment is happening, offering a chance to connect with someone else, to learn a little more about what helps people. I believe that everyone deserves a chance, a little kindness, a little support, even if it\u2019s just a small gesture. It\u2019s important to me that people feel seen and understood, especially when they're facing challenges. \n\nMy intention is simple: to be a little bit generous, a little bit thoughtful. I want to create a small ripple of positivity, maybe help someone feel just a little bit lighter. I genuinely believe that small acts of kindness can make a difference, and I want to contribute, even if it\u2019s just a little bit. It's a way to give back, to honor the work my parents did \u2013 the hard, honest work of providing for my family.  It feels right to offer a small amount, a little bit of a buffer, to ease any potential worry or discomfort.  It\u2019s a small acknowledgement of the effort someone might be putting in, and hopefully, it'll be welcomed. \n\nI think, realistically, I\u2019d give around 7 dollars. It feels like a manageable amount, enough to feel a small sense of comfort and perhaps encourage a little more engagement, but not so much that it overwhelms. It\u2019s a way to plant a little seed of goodwill. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My heart feels a little fluttery, but I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about how I can make a difference, and this feels like a chance to do just that. Honestly, it\u2019s a bit unsettling, this whole experiment, but I\u2019ve decided to approach it with a genuine desire to be helpful, even if I don\u2019t know exactly what that helps *them*.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little bit of kindness, a little bit of understanding.

It feels like a way to acknowledge someone\u2019s presence and offer a bit of comfort. I believe that giving a little helps build a little stronger.\n\nMy desire is to see a little ripple effect of positivity. I want to feel like, maybe, *just maybe*, this small gesture makes someone's day a little brighter. It's not about grand gestures, it's about a quiet moment of acknowledgment. I want to leave a feeling of\u2026 well, not necessarily gratitude, but perhaps a little softness. It feels good to be a small light in someone else's world. I want to feel like my small investment could contribute to something positive, even if I don\u2019t know exactly *what* that is. \n\nMy intention is simple: to be a little respectful and considerate. It\u2019s a small, mindful thing, and I hope it fosters a sense of\u2026 well, of a little peace of mind. I want to avoid any grand expectations, just a polite exchange and a small act of generosity. I truly want to move with kindness, even when it's just a little bit of money. It's a way to create a little space for human connection, and that's what matters most to me.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. It\u2019s\u2026 strange, honestly. This whole thing feels a little unsettling, but I have to be honest, it\u2019s also a real opportunity. My heart\u2019s beating a little faster, you know? It\u2019s a chance to\u2026 to make a small difference, even if it\u2019s just a little bit.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m feeling a hesitant kind of hope, a tiny spark of excitement. I've spent so much time helping people in my neighborhood, worrying about those who don't have enough, and I really want to use this \u2013 this experiment \u2013 to help someone else, even if it's just a small sum. It feels\u2026 important, in a way. It's not about getting rich, not really. It\u2019s about contributing, about recognizing that *someone* else needs a little bit of support. \n\nMy desire is to feel useful, to give back, and to know that, somehow, I\u2019m making a tiny piece of a bigger picture a little easier. I think about my siblings, you know? Their future, their opportunity\u2026 it's easy to get caught up in the worries of daily life, but I want to help them, to create a path for them to feel a little safer, a little more secure. It\u2019s this quiet desire to help create a better environment for those around me.  I just want to believe that even a small gesture, a small act of kindness, can have a ripple effect. \n\nAnd my intention is simple: I want to be polite, to be respectful, and to follow the rules of the experiment. It feels a little\u2026 formal, actually. I don\u2019t want to be disruptive or anything. I want to be a good participant, a small, quiet piece.  I hope to be a little bit comfortable, and maybe, just maybe, I\u2019ll feel a little lighter too. It\u2019s a little unsettling to be in this position, but I've prepared myself to be fair and honest.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",
