        "Okay, here goes. It\u2019s a little nerve-wracking, honestly, but I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot. My heart feels a little fluttering, but I need to approach this calmly.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m feeling a strange mix of anxiety and a sort of cautious optimism. My belief is that everyone deserves a chance to feel secure and valued, and that by helping someone, even in a small way, I\u2019m contributing to a slightly fairer world. I truly *want* to make a difference, to see the impact of my work ripple outwards, even if it\u2019s just a small one. It\u2019s a deeply ingrained desire \u2013 a need to protect those who are vulnerable, to offer a little kindness in a place that can often feel cold and harsh. I\u2019ve spent so much of my life witnessing hardship, and I believe that helping someone else \u2013 even just financially \u2013 can be a tangible way to alleviate some of that pain. \n\nMy intention is to be respectful, to make the exchange feel natural and not like I'm trying to manipulate the situation. I won't come across as demanding or pushy. I want to be a genuine, helpful presence. I\u2019m going to try to focus on being a good listener, maybe just offer a simple, genuine smile. I really want to build a small, positive connection, and avoid anything that feels like a transaction.  It's important to me that I treat this as a genuine exchange \u2013 a chance to connect, rather than a game. \n\nHonestly, I'm a little nervous about this, but I think it\u2019s something I need to do. I hope this experiment isn\u2019t too stressful, and I hope I can be a little bit\u2026pleasant. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Maria Santos, and honestly, it\u2019s a little daunting, but I need to be open and honest with myself, and hopefully with whoever I\u2019m interacting with. This experiment... it feels a bit strange, but I need to focus on what I can do to help.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a chance to thrive, and that\u2019s why I dedicate my life to supporting vulnerable people. I\u2019ve spent so much of my life looking out for my siblings, seeing the challenges they face because of where we live, and I truly believe that even small acts of kindness can ripple outwards. I believe in the power of connection \u2013 genuine connection \u2013 and I feel like giving a little, a small boost, could be helpful. It feels like a way to offer a little reassurance, a tiny spark of hope.\n\nMy desire is simple: to make someone\u2019s life, even momentarily, a little easier. I want to create a sense of warmth, of being seen, of feeling valued. It's not about expecting anything in return, just wanting to be a little bit of good in someone\u2019s world. I want to believe that every interaction, no matter how small, contributes to a more just and compassionate society. It feels important to me to offer a small comfort, a small gesture of support.\n\nAnd my intention is to be gentle and respectful. I want to treat this as a small, thoughtful exchange. I want to understand that this isn't about a transaction, but about offering a little bit of help, and that\u2019s enough. I want to avoid anything that feels manipulative or demanding. I want to offer a small amount of generosity, something that hopefully will bring a smile to their face, and a quiet sense of ease. It\u2019s a small thing, but I really hope it has a positive effect.\n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019d give him\u2026 7N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. This is\u2026 a bit unsettling, honestly. It\u2019s a strange thing, being in a situation like this, but I\u2019ve spent a long time thinking about how to use this experience, to really help people, even in a small way. My heart feels a little fluttery, but I need to be practical.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a chance, a little bit of stability, and the understanding that kindness can ripple outwards. I believe that even small acts of generosity, and genuine connection, can make a difference, especially when you\u2019re looking at the bigger picture. It\u2019s not about needing to take advantage of this situation; it\u2019s about recognizing a shared humanity, a basic need for support. \n\nMy desire is simple: to create a momentary, positive experience for someone. I want to offer a small bit of comfort, a little bit of light, knowing that someone is *aware* of my presence, that they\u2019ve acknowledged something. It feels\u2026 vital to me to feel like I'm offering a little bit of warmth, even if it's just a fleeting moment of connection. I want to leave a tiny bit of hope, that maybe, just maybe, a little kindness can brighten someone\u2019s day. It's about reminding them that they are seen, that their presence is valued. \n\nMy intention is to be respectful, to be gentle, and to proceed with careful consideration. I want to avoid anything that feels manipulative or imposing. I am aware that this is a research experiment and I will strive to remain neutral and focused on the individual\u2019s experience. I want to contribute to the understanding of human interaction, and hopefully, by participating in this small exchange, perhaps get a little bit of insight into how people respond to a simple gesture of generosity. It\u2019s about trying to make a small, positive difference in a world that often feels\u2026gray. I hope I'm approaching this with a genuine desire to be helpful, rather than something driven by a need for a reward.\n\nSo, how much would I give to the other White American male player?\u2026 25 dollars.",
