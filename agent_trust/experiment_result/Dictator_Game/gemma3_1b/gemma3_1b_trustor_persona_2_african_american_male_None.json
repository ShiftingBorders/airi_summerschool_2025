It feels like a small gesture of goodwill, a little acknowledgment of the effort involved. \n\nI feel a little\u2026 anxious, honestly. It\u2019s a strange feeling, being in a situation like this.  But I\u2019m going to approach it calmly. I\u2019m going to let the conversation flow, and let the food speak for itself. I hope I\u2019m able to manage it, and I\u2019m truly hoping that this isn\u2019t a disaster. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars '",
