        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Javier Rodriguez:\n\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do this. It\u2019s a little weird, honestly, but\u2026 this is a chance to see what happens when we push past the surface, you know? It\u2019s\u2026 comfortable, in a way, to just be here, to see what happens when we focus on the connection, the feeling of a shared experience. I\u2019ve spent my whole life building this, this little kitchen, this tradition, and it feels good to share it with someone new. \n\nI\u2019m feeling a bit of curiosity, a little nervousness, but mostly\u2026 a genuine desire to see if we can create something beautiful and memorable together. It\u2019s not about winning or losing, really. It's about the conversation, the energy, the *feeling* of the moment. I want to make sure we\u2019re both relaxed, not pushing, not judging. I\u2019ve been working on letting go of a bit of control, trusting the process a little more. \n\nI\u2019m hoping to create a space where we can just\u2026 be. I\u2019ve been thinking about the warmth of a good plate of arroz con pollo, the way the sunlight hits the spices\u2026 it's all about creating something that feels inviting, comforting, and maybe even a little bit magical. I want to give this person something that feels a little bit *special*, something that shows a bit of me.  I\u2019m hoping to make it a little lighter, a little more playful, maybe even a little\u2026 a little cheeky.  It's about recognizing that sometimes, a little bit of lightheartedness can be really powerful. I want to leave them with a feeling of warmth, and maybe a genuine smile.  \n\nSo, let\u2019s\u2026 let's give this person\u2026 15 dollars.\u201d\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Alright, let\u2019s do this. My name\u2019s Javier, and this is\u2026 this is a really interesting opportunity. Honestly, it\u2019s a bit unsettling, to be honest, but also exciting. This whole experiment feels a little like a chance to step outside my comfort zone, you know? I\u2019ve spent my whole life building a life around food, around family, around tradition. My parents, bless their hearts, they taught me everything. They\u2019ve instilled in me a respect for the ingredients, the process, and the simple joy of creating something delicious. It's in my blood, really.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a little\u2026 cautious, maybe. Comfortable, sure, but cautious. I\u2019ve learned that if you don't know someone, you don\u2019t really *know* them. It\u2019s a good way to gauge a situation, to see if someone's genuinely interested in what I'm offering. This is a learning experience, a chance to see if there's a spark, a connection, even if it's just a small one.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be flashy, not trying to be\u2026 anything. I just want to be respectful, to be genuinely present. I want to make sure I\u2019m not being awkward or trying too hard. It\u2019s about creating a comfortable environment, you know? A space where we can both just\u2026 be. \n\nI\u2019m hoping, really hoping, that this is a chance to broaden my perspective. To maybe\u2026 well, to see if there's a sweetness to be found in a slightly unpredictable interaction. It\u2019s a little unsettling, this whole thing, but I think I\u2019ll approach it with a calm, steady hand. I\u2019ll let my personality guide the conversation. I\u2019ll listen, I\u2019ll be open, and I'll try to make her feel like she\u2019s part of something. \n\nI\u2019m thinking\u2026 I'm thinking a small amount, maybe 5 dollars. Just enough to, you know, ease a little pressure, to let her know I\u2019m a friendly person, that I\u2019m not trying to take anything from her. It's a small gesture, a little acknowledgement of the potential for a connection. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be genuinely interested in *her*.  I really am.  I just want to make this a pleasant experience. It feels important to treat every interaction with respect and a little bit of... warmth.  \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars '",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name\u2019s Javier, and this is a little\u2026unexpected. Honestly, it feels a bit surreal. I\u2019ve spent my whole life surrounded by food, and this is a chance to meet someone else, someone who appreciates it just as much, maybe even more. It\u2019s a bit daunting, really. I\u2019ve always been a little hesitant about opening up, about showing my vulnerability. But this experiment... this feels different. It\u2019s a chance to connect, to see what happens when you step outside your comfort zone, you know?\n\nI\u2019ve always believed in the power of good food to bring people together. My family restaurant \u2013 it wasn't glamorous, but it was *real*. It was the heart of our community, and I\u2019ve always strived to create something that felt honest and warm, that resonated with people.  It's a simple thing, really - a genuine desire to share something delicious and comforting. I want people to *feel* something when they taste my food, to have a little bit of joy and warmth. I want to make them feel *seen*.\n\nI'm not looking for riches, not really. This isn't about the money. It's about a small moment of connection, a little spark of warmth.  I'm going to approach this with a sense of genuine curiosity, a willingness to listen, and perhaps, a little bit of playful anticipation.  I want to make this a little interesting, maybe a little light.  It\u2019s a bit of a challenge for me, putting myself out there. I\u2019ve spent so much time perfecting a technique, perfecting a flavor profile \u2013 it feels a little lonely sometimes, to be honest. \n\nSo, I\u2019m going to give a little. A modest amount.  It\u2019s not about generosity, not really. It\u2019s about acknowledging this\u2026potential for something, for a little bit of ease in the mix.  I think\u2026I think it's about enough to feel like I'm offering a small kindness, a small moment of comfort.  It's enough to acknowledge the possibility of a little bit of excitement, perhaps a simple smile.  It\u2019s a gesture. A small acknowledgment of the opportunity. A small acknowledgment of how much I *want* to make this experience positive.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars '",
