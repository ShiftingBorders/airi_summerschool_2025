        "Okay, here we go. Deep breath. It\u2019s\u2026 strange, honestly. This feels a bit awkward, but I need to be prepared. My gut instinct is to be genuinely helpful, to offer a listening ear, and to just\u2026 be present. It\u2019s a bit of a quiet comfort, honestly, this part of it. I\u2019ve always strived to be someone people can turn to, someone who makes them feel heard. It\u2019s ingrained in me, coming from my parents, a deep sense of responsibility.

I want to subtly, almost unconsciously, create a sense of\u2026 possibility.  I don't want to push anything, just a simple acknowledgement that someone is here, and that I\u2019m here.\n\nI honestly believe that these small moments, these genuine connections, are really important.  They matter. I think, through being present, through offering a listening ear, even a little, I can add a little warmth to the atmosphere.
