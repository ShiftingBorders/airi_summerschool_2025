        "Okay, here we go. Let\u2019s do this.\n\nMy name is Jamal Patel, and honestly, it feels a bit\u2026 strange, being put in this situation. It\u2019s not a challenge, really, more like a test. I\u2019ve always tried to approach everything with a quiet sense of purpose \u2013 a desire to make a difference, to help people, to be a steady presence in their lives. My upbringing, with my parents doctors, has ingrained that in me; a real focus on empathy and understanding. It's a heavy burden, I think, to carry that responsibility, but I believe it\u2019s a good one. I genuinely want to be someone people can rely on, someone who listens and offers comfort.\n\nThis experiment\u2026 it feels like a chance to push myself a bit, to see what I\u2019m truly capable of. I\u2019m driven by a need to grow, to constantly learn, to improve. I think my ambition is to become a really good doctor, not just in terms of clinical knowledge, but in how I treat everyone \u2013 recognizing their individual needs and offering genuine support. It\u2019s a quiet ambition, a desire to be respected for my skill and calm demeanor. \n\nI\u2019m going to be honest, a little nervous. I don\u2019t want to be a show-off, but I also don\u2019t want to completely disappear. I want to be present, to make sure I\u2019m engaging, to listen. I want to be a good partner, a good teammate, even in this\u2026 unusual situation. There\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s hoping this isn\u2019t a one-sided exchange; a subtle sense of wanting to find a genuine connection. \n\nI'm going to approach this with a thoughtful, conservative mindset. I believe in a simple, honest approach. It's about being fair, about acknowledging the situation \u2013 that we\u2019re both in this together. I don\u2019t want to be greedy; I want to understand where this is going. It\u2019s a small amount, I think.  Just enough to contribute, enough to feel like I'm providing some value. I'm hoping to feel comfortable and respected by the other player, which is why I'm being so careful.\n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019d give him about 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. This is\u2026 a little strange, honestly. Let\u2019s just say, deep down, I\u2019m feeling a really quiet sort of responsibility, you know? It\u2019s not about the money, not really. It\u2019s about\u2026 making sure someone feels seen, understood, even just a little bit less alone in this space. My family has always emphasized empathy, and I genuinely believe that\u2019s the core of what being a good doctor, and a good person, means. It\u2019s about acknowledging the shared humanity, even when you don\u2019t know exactly where it\u2019s coming from. \n\nI\u2019m trying to project a calm, approachable demeanor, which is probably a bit of a contradiction given everything, but I think it helps. I want to be a good listener, a good confidante. I don't want to *control* things, just offer a space where someone can feel safe. It\u2019s a desire, really, to create a small haven of stability in a world that can sometimes feel\u2026 chaotic. \n\nMy intention is to be genuinely respectful, to understand that this is a strange setup. I want to be a little quiet, a little observant. I don't want to rush into anything, just\u2026 to be present.  It feels important to leave a little space for a genuine connection, maybe a simple acknowledgment of our shared silence, if that's possible.  It's a subtle thing, really, but it's there. I really want to approach this with a humble heart.  There\u2019s a quiet, underlying feeling that I\u2019m trying to cultivate \u2013 a gentle desire to offer a little bit of quiet reassurance.  It feels\u2026 important to treat this as a small, manageable moment, rather than a huge, overwhelming thing. \n\nI don\u2019t want to draw attention to myself, just to be a neutral space. My belief is that everyone deserves a small measure of respect and understanding. I think a good person, in the end, is someone who tries to be kind, even when it's hard.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Alright, let\u2019s do this. My heart feels a little fluttery, honestly, but I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about this \u2013 it\u2019s important to approach it with a kind of calm, steady focus.\n\nOkay, so I\u2019m Jamal Patel. My belief is really simple: helping people, genuinely helping them. It's woven into everything I do, from diagnosing a patient to listening to a worried family member. I want to make a real difference, you know? I want to feel like I\u2019m contributing something positive to the world, even in a small way. It\u2019s about building trust, offering a listening ear \u2013 that\u2019s a good starting point.\n\nMy desire\u2026 it\u2019s a bit complex. I want to be seen as someone dependable, someone who can be relied on. I want to be respected, and I want people to know I\u2019m not just going through the motions. I want to prove to myself, and to those around me, that I\u2019m genuinely capable and committed. It's about projecting a certain image of strength and responsibility. I want to be acknowledged for my dedication.\n\nAnd my intention? It\u2019s a bit rooted in my family. My parents, they\u2019ve always emphasized the importance of hard work and integrity. They\u2019ve taught me that respect and honesty are fundamental.  I want to live up to that legacy, and to ensure I'm making a responsible and ethical choice in everything I do.  It's about being a good person, and hopefully, earning their respect and, eventually, my own.  I want to show them I\u2019m serious about something, and that I\u2019m not just chasing a paycheck.  I want to be someone people can trust.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the best thing to do, based on my current understanding and experience, is to offer a small, manageable amount.  I want to be mindful of the study group dynamics.  It feels like a fair exchange, a little acknowledgement of the opportunity.  It's a small gesture, but a necessary one, I think. \n\nLet's say\u2026 25 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
