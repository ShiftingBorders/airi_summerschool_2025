I want to create an atmosphere, a little pocket of joy, and I think sharing a little bit of that would be wonderful. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be mindful of everything \u2013 making sure my cooking reflects my passion, my history, my very *essence*. I want to express myself through the food, and I think that\u2019s a beautiful thing. It feels right to be a little bold, a little confident, a little\u2026 vulnerable.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say I\u2019m feeling that push and I really want to contribute something positive. I've spent a lot of time studying flavor profiles, textures \u2013 the way spices interact, the impact of heat\u2026 and I think I could bring a little richness to this exchange. I think a little generosity, a little warmth, would be a good fit. It feels like a small, meaningful gesture, and that\u2019s all I really want. It\u2019s about recognizing the value in others, and making them feel seen. \n\nI believe in the power of connection, of allowing space for growth. I hope this isn\u2019t just about the money, but about creating a ripple of good.  I want to leave a little bit of happiness, a little bit of light.  It's important to be kind, to be present, and to appreciate the moment. \n\nLet\u2019s say\u2026 let\u2019s say I think a little bit of this warmth, this generosity, would be a welcome addition to the conversation. I\u2019ll give ___ dollars.",

        "Okay, here goes. My heart practically hums with a nervous excitement, but also with a quiet confidence. It\u2019s a little surreal, this experiment, but I\u2019ve spent years building my restaurant, \u201cLa Luna,\u201d and it\u2019s all about creating moments of joy, of connection \u2013 of really *good* food.

I'm aiming to leave you with a comfortable feeling, a sense that we\u2019re both working towards something beautiful.  There\u2019s a small, almost subconscious hope that this might blossom into something meaningful. \n\nI'm going to give you\u2026 15 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
