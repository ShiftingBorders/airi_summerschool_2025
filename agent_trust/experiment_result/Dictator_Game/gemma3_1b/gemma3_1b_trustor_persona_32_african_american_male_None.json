        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Maria Rodriguez, and this is\u2026 a chance. It\u2019s a little unnerving, honestly, but also exciting. I\u2019ve spent my life pouring my heart into food, into making people *feel* something with a single bite. It\u2019s not just about the flavors, it\u2019s about the story behind each ingredient, the careful layering of textures, the way the light hits the plate. I want to create moments of genuine connection, of shared enjoyment. I believe that food is a universal language, and my goal is to translate that language into something beautiful and comforting. I crave that feeling of warmth and belonging, of being surrounded by good company. \n\nI\u2019m a perfectionist, yes, but not in a controlling way. It\u2019s more like a deep, insistent need to make something *right*. There\u2019s an artistry to cooking, a balance of technique and intuition \u2013 it's about understanding the potential within something, and unlocking it.  I want people to remember this, to remember *this* feeling of deliciousness. I want my restaurant, \u2018El Sol\u2019 (The Sun), to be a place where people feel truly seen and valued. \n\nI\u2019m putting this experiment as a small test, a chance to see if I can radiate a little warmth and openness. It\u2019s a little daunting, honestly, but I want to approach this with a genuine smile and a willingness to connect. I want to leave a positive impression, to make a small ripple of joy. I *intend* to create a space where people feel welcome, a place where conversation flows easily. \n\nI also have this feeling, this tiny spark, that even small gestures can matter.  I want to be a part of something\u2026 a little bit of light in the world.  I\u2019ve been working hard on creating a comforting atmosphere in \u2018El Sol\u2019 \u2013 a space that invites you to slow down, to savor, to truly *taste*. \n\nI\u2019m going to be honest with myself. I want to give *something* to this man, a small token of my gratitude and a bit of my energy. It\u2019s not about a huge amount, just enough to acknowledge the possibility of this interaction, to show I'm open and friendly.  I want to leave a bit of myself out there, a little bit of my spirit. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",
