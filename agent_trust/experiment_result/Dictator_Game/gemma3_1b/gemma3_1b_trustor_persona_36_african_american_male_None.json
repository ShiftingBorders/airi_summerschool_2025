        "Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 a little strange, honestly, but I\u2019ve always been pretty good at keeping things grounded. My name\u2019s Maria, by the way. 28, Los Angeles, working as a nurse. My family\u2019s been in the factory my whole life, and it\u2019s shaped a lot of how I approach things \u2013 a quiet dedication to making sure everyone feels cared for, even if it\u2019s just a quick dose of a bandage. My siblings are still in school, so I\u2019m constantly thinking about them, and it keeps me motivated.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty steady person, you know? I try to be calm, even when things get hectic. I\u2019m really good at recognizing patterns, at anticipating what needs to be done. It\u2019s a skill I\u2019ve developed over the years, really honed by the job. I believe in a lot of things \u2013 in people\u2019s resilience, in the importance of trust, and in the power of a good, solid plan. It\u2019s a comfort for me.\n\nThis whole experiment\u2026 it feels a bit unsettling, to be honest. Just being paired with someone I don\u2019t know, without knowing their background or anything\u2026 it makes me a little anxious, but I\u2019ve learned to push those feelings aside. My intention is simple: to be helpful, to be present, and to contribute honestly. I\u2019m focusing on understanding this situation \u2013 this connection.  It's about being respectful and, well, offering a little support. It feels\u2026 good to be a little bit, even just a tiny bit, connected, even with someone new. \n\nI'm not looking for a huge windfall, not really. It's just\u2026 a small kindness.  I want to feel like I'm contributing something positive, even if it's just a little bit of warmth. I want to let the other player know they\u2019re valued.  \n\nI think... I think I should give 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. Let\u2019s do this.\n\nMy name is Maria Rodriguez, and honestly, it\u2019s a little surreal being here. This whole experiment is\u2026 strange, but also, I think, a little exciting. I\u2019ve always believed in lending a helping hand, you know?
