It\u2019s not about the money, not really. It\u2019s about helping people, about making sure someone feels a little safer, a little more comfortable. That\u2019s always been my driving force. \n\nI\u2019ve always believed in the importance of kindness, even when it\u2019s hard. And I genuinely want to be a good person, a good nurse.

        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Maria Rodriguez.\n\nMy heart feels a little fluttery, honestly. This is\u2026 a little strange, but also kind of exciting, I guess.

I want to create a feeling of\u2026 understanding.  I really want to be a good person, and I want to show someone that I can be dependable.  I'll do my best to be fair, and I'll try to be open, without pushing anyone.  I want to let my calm presence be helpful, and hopefully, in a way that\u2019s beneficial for both of us. \n\nI have a small, quiet belief \u2013 that everyone deserves a chance to be seen and valued.  And a quiet desire to create a sense of mutual respect, even if it\u2019s just a small gesture.
