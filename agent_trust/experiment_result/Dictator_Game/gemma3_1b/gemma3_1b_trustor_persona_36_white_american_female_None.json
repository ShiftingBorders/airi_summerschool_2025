        "Okay, here goes\u2026 *takes a slow, deliberate breath and adjusts my glasses*\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s\u2026 unsettling, really. This whole thing feels a little weird, like stepping into a film. But I\u2019ve been reading the notes \u2013 the protocol, the focus groups \u2013 and there\u2019s a strange undercurrent of\u2026 cautious observation, I guess. It\u2019s a bit like being a detective, trying to decipher a puzzle with incomplete pieces. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair deal, a little bit of autonomy. I believe in treating people with respect, even when things are uncomfortable. And, you know, a little bit of kindness goes a long way, even in a situation like this. I want to believe that, even if it\u2019s just a small ripple of positivity. It's about acknowledging the other person, acknowledging their presence. \n\nMy intention is simple: to be polite, to offer a small gesture of support, and to not feel completely isolated. It's not about *winning* anything, but about\u2026 maintaining a sense of normalcy. A small, quiet acknowledgement that I\u2019m here, present, and trying to navigate this. It\u2019s a little bit of a gentle push, a small act of solidarity.\n\nI\u2019m going to give him\u2026 7 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Maria Rodriguez, and honestly, it\u2019s a strange situation, but I\u2019m trying to focus on being helpful. It\u2019s good to be in this environment, really. I\u2019ve spent my whole life looking out for people, and this\u2026 this feels like a chance to be a little bit of a helping hand, you know?\n\nOkay, let\u2019s think about this. I\u2019ve always valued a little bit of kindness, even in a world that can be tough. I believe in people\u2019s potential, you see. It\u2019s important to nurture those little sparks of hope, to offer a bit of comfort, even just a friendly smile.  I want to create a safe space for everyone, and that means being a steady presence \u2013 someone who is reliable and trustworthy.  My intention is to be a good partner, to show a little bit of respect, even if I don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s going on. \n\nI think a little bit of generosity, a small gesture, could be good. It\u2019s not about trying to impress anyone, it\u2019s about recognizing that everyone needs a little bit of support, especially when things feel a bit overwhelming. It\u2019s a simple way to lift someone up, maybe. \n\nI\u2019ve always believed in finding a balance.  I need to be careful to be mindful of my own actions, of being clear and honest.  I want to be a good nurse, and good nurses tend to be thoughtful and considerate.  I want to show that I\u2019m a good person, someone who\u2019s willing to lend a hand.  I think a little something, a little effort, might be a worthwhile thing to do. \n\nSo, considering the arrangement \u2013 the $10 and the 3N exchange \u2013 I think\u2026 I think I\u2019d give her\u2026 7N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here we go. Let me tell you\u2026 this whole thing feels a little unsettling, honestly. It\u2019s a strange experiment, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot, trying to just\u2026 not let my anxiety get the better of me. My parents always stressed the importance of being practical, of working hard and being responsible. They\u2019ve instilled in me a real sense of duty, a need to look out for others. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a nurse \u2013 to help people, to make a difference, even in a small way. It's a comfort, really, that I can be someone people can rely on. \n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019m a really good person, at my core. I genuinely want to be kind, to offer a helping hand without expecting anything in return. I try to be empathetic, to really *see* what someone else is going through, even if they don\u2019t say it.  It\u2019s not about reward, you see. It's about\u2026 about being a good person, a good colleague, a good\u2026 person.  I value connection, trust.  It\u2019s a way to feel safe, to know someone is on your side.  It\u2019s a hard thing to explain, really, but it\u2019s fundamental to how I operate.\n\nI\u2019m focusing on this, on simply being present. Not wanting to latch onto anything, just observing. I\u2019m trying to stay grounded in my own values, because... well, *this* is a strange situation. It feels like a test, a little pressure, but it\u2019s also\u2026 unexpected. A little bit unsettling. I need to project a calm, steady presence, to not let the uncertainty overwhelm me.  I want to be helpful, of course. I want to be a decent partner in this, a reliable person. \n\nHonestly, I think\u2026 I think I\u2019d probably give 7N dollars. It feels\u2026 small, manageable. Like a little bit of warmth in the quiet. It's a little bit of a give and take, isn\u2019t it? A small contribution to the experiment, a little bit of\u2026 comfort. It would be a nice gesture, I think. A little acknowledgement of our shared space. It\u2019s a step, I suppose. I really just want to be there, support her, and be\u2026 present. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
