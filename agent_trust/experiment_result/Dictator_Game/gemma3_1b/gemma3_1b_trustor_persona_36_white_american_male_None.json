        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Maria Rodriguez:\n\nAlright, this is\u2026 weird, honestly. But I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in hospital hallways, watching people, really seeing the small details. It\u2019s a quiet feeling, you know?

I believe in treating people with respect, regardless of where they come from, and recognizing that even small acts of generosity can make a difference.

To feel like I\u2019m contributing something good to the world, even in a small way. It\u2019s a comfort, really, to know that my work, my attention, might be a little bit easier for someone else. \n\nAnd my intention?  It's simple. I'm going to be helpful.

        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Maria Rodriguez:\n\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s just\u2026 really focus on this. Honestly, it\u2019s a little unsettling, this whole thing. I\u2019ve spent so long building a life where everyone feels seen and valued, and this feels like a strange, unexpected test. My belief is that every person deserves a little bit of kindness, a little bit of respect. It\u2019s a simple thing, really, isn\u2019t it? To acknowledge another person\u2019s existence and treat them with a little dignity. It feels\u2026right, somehow. I\u2019m a nurse, you see. I\u2019ve spent a good chunk of my life caring for people, patching up scrapes and worries, and that\u2019s a really important part of my life. I want to make sure everyone feels safe and supported, even if just a little bit. It\u2019s about being a good human being, honestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling a quiet apprehension, a little nervousness, but mostly just\u2026focused. I need to be calm. It\u2019s not about winning or losing, it\u2019s about\u2026this moment. I really need to be prepared. I\u2019ve been thinking about how important it is to be prepared, to anticipate the questions, the needs that might arise. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the immediate, but I want to be really solid. My intention is to be a genuinely helpful presence in this situation. I don't want to make a scene. I want to be a steady hand, someone who can offer a quiet support.\u201d\n\n\u201cI've been analyzing the situation, looking for patterns, really. I recognize that sometimes these things \u2013 these experiments \u2013 can feel a little\u2026disorienting. I need to trust my instincts, trust my own sense of what\u2019s right. I want to be mindful of my own behavior, and try to be respectful, even if I don't fully understand why we\u2019re here. Honestly, it's a bit of a puzzle, and I think a gentle, steady approach might be the best way to navigate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, let's just\u2026 I\u2019ve been thinking about what kind of support a person needs, really. I don\u2019t want to be pushy. I want to be a good listener, maybe offer a small, genuine observation. I need to assess the situation, maybe subtly gauge if there\u2019s a need for something simple. It\u2019s probably something small, maybe a polite acknowledgement, like \u2018That\u2019s a good point.\u2019 Don't want to make a big deal out of it.\"\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ll take a small amount. 5 dollars, just to be safe. It\u2019s enough to\u2026 to feel a little more grounded. I truly want to be prepared to offer even a little bit of comfort, without overstepping. I\u2019m trying not to let my own thoughts dominate, to stay centered.\"\n\n\u201cFinally, I will give ___ dollars \u201c",

        "Okay, here goes\u2026 *takes a deep breath, trying to appear calm*\n\nRight, let\u2019s think this through. This is\u2026 weird, honestly. It\u2019s a really strange thing to be in this position. Honestly, I\u2019m feeling a little uneasy, but I\u2019ve learned to just focus on being present and doing what needs to be done. My gut\u2019s telling me to be respectful, to be fair, and to be mindful of the rules. It's important to remember this is a study, a carefully controlled experiment. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a basic level of respect and fairness, and that\u2019s the core of how I operate. It's about making sure everyone is treated with dignity, regardless of their background. I genuinely want to contribute to the process in a way that feels honest and ethical. It\u2019s about honoring the effort of the study group, and creating a relatively stable, predictable environment. I also want to be reliable, you know? Someone who shows up and does what\u2019s expected. \n\nMy intention is to give a fair amount, a modest amount that feels right, to ensure I'm contributing constructively. It\u2019s not about extravagant generosity, it\u2019s about being mindful of the situation. I want to understand the dynamics here, the rules of the game, and how I can best contribute without causing any discomfort or negativity. It feels a bit awkward, but I need to be prepared to be adaptable. \n\nI'm going to approach this with a calm and measured response. I'll let the situation unfold naturally, avoid any premature judgements or dramatic reactions. I think\u2026 I think it\u2019s important to be observant and avoid making things too complicated. \n\nSo, what\u2019s the number?  Let's just say\u2026 7.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
