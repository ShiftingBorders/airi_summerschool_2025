        "Okay, here goes. My heart\u2019s a little fluttering, honestly, but I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot. It\u2019s\u2026 interesting. \n\nRight now, I feel a pull towards a balance, a gentle nudge towards understanding. I\u2019m trying to be open, to really *see* this person without needing to label them. This experiment feels like a chance to test that, to see if genuine connection can bloom from unexpected pairings. It's not about winning or losing; it\u2019s about a little bit of exploration.\n\nI believe that everyone, regardless of their background, deserves to feel seen and valued. Fashion, in its purest form, is about expression \u2013 about telling a story through color, texture, and form. And that story, that individual narrative, is shaped by so much more than just the clothes we wear. It\u2019s about heritage, identity, and the choices people make. I want to create a space where those stories can be acknowledged and celebrated, not just superficially. \n\nMy desire is to foster a feeling of respect and quiet confidence. I want to move past the initial awkwardness and let there be a thread of warmth, of mutual acknowledgment. I think it\u2019s important to approach this with a thoughtful, gentle intention \u2013 not a demanding one, but a sincere wish for a connection that feels genuine. It\u2019s about creating a little spark of light in the shadows, allowing that spark to grow. It's about recognizing the value in each individual, regardless of the label they might carry. I want to subtly signal a willingness to learn, to listen, and to be a part of something bigger than just the experiment itself. \n\nMy intention is to allow for a small, quiet exchange \u2013 not to be overtly friendly, but to offer a moment of mindful attention. A small gesture of acknowledgment. It feels a little vulnerable, really, but I feel a profound need to offer a bit of space, a bit of trust. \n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019d give him 15 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. My heart\u2019s a little fluttering with a mix of nervousness and excitement \u2013 this is a new challenge, a chance to really stretch myself. Let\u2019s just\u2026 breathe.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s say\u2026 let\u2019s say I\u2019d give him 7N.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve always believed that fashion, at its core, is about stories. It\u2019s about amplifying voices, celebrating difference, and creating a space where everyone feels seen and valued. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the *rules* of the industry \u2013 the trends, the budgets, the expectations \u2013 but I think true artistry lies in pushing beyond those boundaries. My background, growing up in this family, has always instilled a deep respect for heritage and tradition, but also a fierce desire to recognize and incorporate the beauty of every culture. I want to weave a little more color into the landscape, to make sure there\u2019s room for *everyone* to express themselves authentically. \n\nI know that sometimes, the current system can feel a little\u2026 incomplete. There\u2019s a need for more representation, for designers to actively seek out voices *outside* the usual suspects. I genuinely want to contribute, to create something that feels less like a curated highlight reel and more like a genuine celebration of global styles.  I want to challenge assumptions, to encourage dialogue, and perhaps, subtly, to influence the conversation in a more thoughtful way.  It\u2019s about recognizing that beauty isn\u2019t limited by skin color, by background, by anything. It\u2019s about the *soul* of the design. \n\nI think this experiment\u2026 it\u2019s a small step, but a step towards a more inclusive future. It\u2019s about acknowledging the value in diversity, and using that to inform my work.  It feels important to offer a little bit of warmth and generosity, a gesture of acknowledging the strength and richness of others.  It feels like a simple way to acknowledge the inherent worth of a person, regardless of their background. \n\nI want to give him 7N. It feels like a right amount, a comfortable level of support for someone who's clearly creative and insightful.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Mei Ling, and right now, I\u2019m feeling a little\u2026 cautious. It\u2019s a little unsettling to be thrust into this situation, honestly. But I\u2019ve spent so long building this life, this design world, that I can\u2019t really afford to be paralyzed by hesitation. It\u2019s a chance to meet someone completely new, to see if there\u2019s a spark, a connection, that doesn\u2019t rely on preconceived notions. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves to feel seen and valued, regardless of their background. The fashion industry, frankly, has a history of marginalizing and silencing certain voices. I want to contribute to a space where those voices are actually heard, where styles are celebrated, and where individuals aren\u2019t judged based on stereotypes. It\u2019s about recognizing that diversity isn't just a trend, it\u2019s the foundation of truly compelling design. \n\nMy desire is simple: to make a small, positive impact. To offer a little comfort, maybe a shared experience, and to perhaps, subtly encourage a kind of understanding. I want to create a space where people feel *seen*, not just observed. I want to build bridges, not walls. I\u2019m hoping this interaction will spark a small shift in perspective, a moment of genuine curiosity. \n\nAnd my intention? It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about contributing to a more equitable and vibrant world. I want to show, through my work and this brief exchange, that beauty isn\u2019t limited by skin color, by background, or by any other arbitrary distinction.  I\u2019m hoping to leave a little space for things to simply *flow*, for connections to be made without the pressure of expectation.  I want to create an atmosphere where vulnerability is okay.  It feels\u2026 right. \n\nI\u2019ll give ___ dollars.",
