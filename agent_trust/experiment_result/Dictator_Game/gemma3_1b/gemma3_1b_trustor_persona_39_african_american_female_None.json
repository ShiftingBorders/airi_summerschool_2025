        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Sarah, and honestly, this feels a little surreal, but also\u2026 exciting. It\u2019s a chance to connect with someone new, a little weird, but also potentially really rewarding. My whole life has been about building things, figuring things out, and proving myself. I\u2019ve always been driven to tackle challenges, and coding feels like the best way to do that \u2013 it\u2019s a puzzle I can really get lost in.  I really enjoy a good problem, and I thrive when I can contribute to a team\u2019s success. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of funny, actually, feeling this sort of\u2026 expectation. I guess I\u2019m a bit of a perfectionist, I suppose, and I like things to be smooth and well-executed. It means I like to be thoughtful, to plan things out before I start.  I don\u2019t want to rush things, and I\u2019m always aiming for the most logical solution.\n\nI'm feeling a little anxious, a little nervous, but also really hopeful. It\u2019s a good opportunity to build a connection, to see where things go.  I guess I want this to be a mutually beneficial situation \u2013 a little bit of fun, and maybe a little bit of a boost, but more than anything, I want to make something worthwhile. \n\nI\u2019ve got this feeling, a little bit of curiosity, that maybe this is a chance to make a small contribution. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything huge, just\u2026 a little bit of help, a little bit of consideration. I believe in the power of collaboration, and I\u2019m hoping that this experience will help me strengthen those connections. I truly desire to feel comfortable and confident, knowing that I'm a valuable asset to a group. \n\nAnd frankly, I want to leave something behind, something positive. I want to be remembered, not just for solving problems, but for trying to be a good person \u2013 kind, thoughtful, and reliable.  I intend to treat this situation with respect and a genuine willingness to cooperate. \n\nSo, to answer your question, I think I would give her\u2026 75 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, as Sarah Johnson:\n\n\u201cHonestly? I\u2019m going to give him\u2026 six dollars. It feels\u2026right. It feels like a manageable step, a little acknowledgement of our shared space. It\u2019s a small thing, but it feels like a gesture of\u2026trust, I guess.  It\u2019s a bit unsettling to be paired with someone I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve been feeling a little lonely lately, you know?  I think it\u2019s important to have *some* connection, even if it's just a small one.  I need a little bit of normalcy in my day, a quiet moment to just\u2026 breathe.  It\u2019s a reminder that even small exchanges can feel meaningful, a little bit of comfort in this sometimes overwhelming city. I want to feel a sense of partnership, you know? Like we\u2019re working together, not just exchanging money.  It\u2019s a small investment, a little bit of luck, really. I\u2019m hoping it creates a little\u2026 momentum, a sense of ease in this collaborative environment.\u201d\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars \n\n",

        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Sarah Johnson as authentically as I can.\n\n\u201cHonestly? I think it\u2019s about a fair split, a little bit. It feels right to me. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about how we all come from different backgrounds, and I genuinely believe in a collaborative effort. This isn\u2019t just about the $10; it\u2019s about understanding each other a bit better. My belief is that we all bring unique strengths to the table, and a little bit of shared effort can be really valuable. \n\nI\u2019m driven by a desire to build something really strong, you know? Something that\u2019s both successful and meaningful. I want to feel like I'm contributing something positive, and this feels like a chance to meet someone new, someone who\u2019s equally focused and perhaps even a little bit different. It\u2019s a bit daunting, admittedly, but I\u2019m excited by the possibility of getting to know someone on a deeper level. \n\nMy intention is to be a genuinely helpful and supportive participant. I want to focus on listening, understanding, and offering my expertise constructively. It's about creating a space where we can learn from each other, without any pressure or expectation of anything specific. I want to show that I\u2019m willing to put in the effort and work hard, not just for the money, but because I genuinely care about the outcome. I need to let myself be open to connection, and I want to make this a positive and collaborative experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, I will give ___ dollars \u201c",
