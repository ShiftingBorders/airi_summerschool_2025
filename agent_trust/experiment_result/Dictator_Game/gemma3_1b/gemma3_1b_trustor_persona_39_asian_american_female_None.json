        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Sarah Johnson:\n\nRight, this is\u2026 interesting. Honestly, I\u2019m feeling a bit of a nervous energy, you know? It\u2019s a really straightforward scenario, but it\u2019s also a little unsettling, like stepping into a slightly awkward space. My gut reaction is a little cautious, a need to assess things without rushing into anything. I\u2019ve spent a good chunk of my life learning to be comfortable with complexity, and this feels like a test of that. I\u2019m aiming to be a good partner, someone who\u2019s thoughtful and doesn't just jump in blindly. \n\nMy belief is that we can learn something from this, even if it\u2019s just a quiet understanding. It's not about winning or losing, really. It\u2019s about observing, understanding the dynamics, and gauging the other person\u2019s approach. I think there\u2019s a lot of unspoken communication happening, and I want to be observant. I\u2019m hoping to be a neutral, reliable presence.\n\nMy desire is simple: to be a good teammate. To contribute constructively, to make the experiment flow smoothly, and maybe even \u2013 just maybe \u2013 have a bit of fun with it. I don't want to be a burden, and I definitely don't want to overshadow anyone. I want to make sure our interactions are respectful and that everyone feels comfortable. It\u2019s a little intimidating, but I\u2019ve learned that investing in a solid foundation of respect and collaboration is key. \n\nAnd my intention is to be polite, to be mindful of their space and time. I want to be generous, but not carelessly so. I want to offer a little something that feels balanced \u2013 a recognition of their presence, without overwhelming the situation.  I\u2019m thinking of it as a small gesture of goodwill, a way to establish a gentle connection. A little kindness goes a long way, right? \n\nHonestly, it feels like a chance to test myself. To see how people react under pressure. It\u2019s a little daunting, but also... a little exciting.  I'm trying to project calm, a steady presence. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars ",

        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Sarah Johnson as authentically as I can:\n\n\u201cHonestly? I\u2019m thinking about a pretty even split, maybe 7N to 7N. It feels like a fair balance, you know? I\u2019ve been feeling a little\u2026 overwhelmed lately, processing everything. It\u2019s a lot to keep up with, juggling work, my siblings, and this fitness thing. This experiment, it\u2019s a chance to connect with someone new, to maybe learn something, and honestly, it\u2019s a small, easy win. I\u2019m going to take the time to be genuinely present with her, to listen, and see where the conversation leads. I\u2019m hoping to build a connection, even if it\u2019s just a small one.  It\u2019s a bit of a nervous energy, this whole thing, but I want to be respectful and open. I want to make sure this isn\u2019t about anything more than a pleasant, easy exchange.  I don\u2019t want to make a big deal of anything, just a little bit of friendly interaction. I\u2019m a fairly cautious person, so I want to avoid anything that feels too intense. It feels like a low-stakes situation, so I\u2019ll aim for a comfortable, manageable amount.  I need to be mindful of my own energy too \u2013 I'm trying to be really calm and focused, not rushing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to me, you know, to feel like I\u2019m contributing something positive, even if it\u2019s just a small ripple.  I want to leave the experience with a little bit of a sense of\u2026 comfort.  I think a good amount of it will be a little bit of reassurance, a bit of peace of mind, maybe a little bit of ease.  I guess I want to feel like this isn't going to be a huge, dramatic exchange.  It\u2019s a little thing, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, I will give ___ dollars \u2018\u201d",
