        "Okay, here goes. This is\u2026interesting. It\u2019s a little nerve-wracking, honestly, but I\u2019ve spent so much time honing my skills, analyzing problems, and figuring out the optimal strategies, that I don\u2019t want to fumble.

I\u2019m hoping to understand the dynamic a little better before committing to anything.  I\u2019m trying to avoid drawing attention to myself \u2013 that\u2019s the hardest part, really. \n\nOkay\u2026\n\nI think\u2026I think I\u2019d give him\u2026 7N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
