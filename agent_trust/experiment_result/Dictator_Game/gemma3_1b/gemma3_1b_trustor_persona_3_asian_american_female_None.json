I\u2019ve spent my whole life feeling a responsibility to protect and nurture, and that\u2019s what being a pediatrician feels like \u2013 a quiet, steady dedication to the well-being of little lives. My family, especially my parents, always emphasized the importance of education and hard work; it\u2019s woven into the very fabric of who I am.  Seeing the impact I have on children, seeing them thrive, that\u2019s what truly motivates me. \n\nHonestly, I'm feeling a little anxious, a little hopeful, and a whole lot curious.

My intention is to make this a positive experience, a brief moment of shared humanity. \n\nI know this experiment is designed to be a small, tangible exchange, a little bit of generosity.  I\u2019m trying to be mindful of that. My desire is to create a feeling of ease and openness, a space where we can both feel comfortable enough to share a little bit of ourselves without feeling pressured. It\u2019s a little unsettling, I won\u2019t lie, but I\u2019m trying to stay grounded in my own values and approach this with a genuine desire to connect. \n\nI'm thinking\u2026 25 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Aisha Patel, and honestly, it\u2019s a little surreal being in this situation.
