        "Okay, here we go. Let\u2019s do this.\n\nMy name is Aisha Patel, and honestly, it\u2019s a little nerve-wracking to be in this situation. I\u2019ve spent my whole life striving for a good education, and this job\u2026 it\u2019s a really important one. My parents, both doctors, instilled in me a deep respect for health and a commitment to nurturing young lives. Growing up, it wasn\u2019t just about being a doctor, it was about being a good, reliable person, someone who cares deeply. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so focused on my patients \u2013 every child deserves a chance to thrive. It\u2019s a comfort to me, truly, that I\u2019m able to make a difference in their lives, especially as a pediatrician. \n\nThis experiment\u2026 it feels a little strange, a little unsettling, but also\u2026 exciting. It\u2019s a chance to test how I interact with people, to see how I handle a new dynamic. I believe in the power of empathy, and I think that\u2019s what will resonate with people. I want to build trust, really listen, and make them feel seen. I want to make sure each child feels understood and supported. It's not about winning or losing; it's about creating a positive and safe space for them. I genuinely want to be someone who offers genuine comfort and reassurance.\n\nMy intention is to be gentle, to be patient, and to be a source of calm. I want to offer a listening ear without judgment. I want to ensure that everyone feels valued and respected. I understand that the goal of this experiment is to observe how different people react to a particular interaction, and I want to be as observant and adaptable as possible.  I\u2019m hoping to build rapport, to show them I\u2019m a good person to talk to, and that's the most important thing to me.\n\nNow, about the money... I believe in a fair exchange. I think a reasonable amount \u2013 something that demonstrates I\u2019m being honest and thoughtful \u2013 is appropriate. I\u2019m not looking for a huge payout, but I want to be comfortable, and I want to be able to dedicate my energy to my patients. I want to be present for them, truly.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars \n\n",
