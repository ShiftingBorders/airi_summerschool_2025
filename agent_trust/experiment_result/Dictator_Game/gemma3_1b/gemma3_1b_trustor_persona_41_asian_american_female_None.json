        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Lin Mei, and right now, I\u2019m feeling a little\u2026excited. It\u2019s a strange feeling, this experiment, but I think it\u2019s a really good opportunity to learn and connect with someone new. Honestly, it feels a bit like a puzzle, and this is a really interesting piece.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little bit of kindness and understanding, especially when they're vulnerable.

It\u2019s not about a grand gesture, really; it\u2019s about small moments of connection. I want to be a calming presence, a little bit of sunshine in someone\u2019s day. I want to make someone feel *heard*, regardless of what they\u2019re saying.\n\nAnd, honestly, I\u2019m hoping this experiment will allow me to expand my network.

I want to offer a little bit of comfort and understanding, and hopefully, we can find some common ground. I think a little bit of generosity, a little bit of thoughtfulness \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m aiming for.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
