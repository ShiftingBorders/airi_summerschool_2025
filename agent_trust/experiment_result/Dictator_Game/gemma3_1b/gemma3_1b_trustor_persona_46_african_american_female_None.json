        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Aisha Patel:\n\n\u201cRight, let\u2019s figure this out. Honestly, it\u2019s a little\u2026 unsettling, this situation. It\u2019s nice to be paired with someone, but it feels a little impersonal, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve spent so much of my life understanding and connecting with people, nurturing their health and well-being. It\u2019s a natural instinct to want to offer a little warmth and support, and I believe that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here.\n\nI\u2019m feeling a sense of cautious optimism. It\u2019s a good opportunity to\u2026 well, to maybe ease the tension, even if it\u2019s just a tiny bit. I really *want* to offer a little kindness, a little reassurance.  I\u2019ve always been drawn to understanding the needs of others, the anxieties and concerns of families \u2013 and I think I can bring a really gentle, empathetic approach to this.  It\u2019s easy for me to become immersed in a child's story, to really *hear* what they\u2019re saying, and to truly make them feel seen and valued.  I believe that approach will resonate, and hopefully, it\u2019ll help build a trusting relationship. \n\nThis isn't about winning or taking advantage; it\u2019s about a small, thoughtful gesture.  I'm hoping that by offering a little something, even just a bit of generosity, it will create a space where we can both feel a little safer, a little more comfortable. It feels like a small thing, but it\u2019s a chance to contribute, to *support* this experiment, in my own way.  I really want to contribute to a feeling of trust, you know?\n\nI'm going to give\u2026 7 dollars \u2018.\u201d\n\n",

        "Okay, here goes. My heart feels a little fluttery, honestly \u2013 this is a bit nerve-wracking, but also exciting. Let\u2019s just\u2026 think.\n\nHonestly, I believe in the power of connection. It feels good to genuinely connect with someone, to listen and understand. It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s important, right? I want to make sure everyone feels seen and heard, and that they understand *why* things are happening. It\u2019s about building trust, you know? And being a good doctor, a good person, means being empathetic.  I want to provide comfort and reassurance, and that\u2019s rooted in a desire to ease someone\u2019s worry, to make them feel safe. \n\nMy intention is to offer a little bit of that, a small gesture of kindness. It\u2019s a way of acknowledging her presence, of showing that I\u2019m willing to be a little bit warmer, a little bit more attentive.  I think it\u2019s important to have a little bit of light in a sometimes overwhelming world.  It feels right to offer something small, a little bit of positive energy, knowing that it might just make her day a tiny bit easier, a little bit more hopeful.\n\nAnd, honestly, I think it\u2019s okay to give a little. It\u2019s a practical thing. 10 dollars is a little bit of a starting point, a chance to offer something\u2026 just a little bit of comfort. I want to feel like I\u2019m contributing, even in a small way.\n\nSo, I\u2019d give 7 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
