I want to explain things clearly, answer their questions honestly, and be patient with them \u2013 they\u2019re likely navigating a very emotional time.  It feels important to offer a sense of calm and understanding. \n\nI\u2019m aiming to bring a little bit of warmth and a bit of thoughtfulness to this situation.  I want to show that I value each person\u2019s perspective. I believe in treating everyone with respect and compassion.  \n\nSo, thinking about the potential for a comfortable and helpful interaction, I\u2026 I would give him 15 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
