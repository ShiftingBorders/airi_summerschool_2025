        "Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 a little nerve-wracking, honestly. Let\u2019s just\u2026 try to keep it calm.\n\nRight, let\u2019s think about this. It\u2019s a really simple exchange, really. It\u2019s about a small, manageable amount. I\u2019ve always believed in a little bit of kindness, a little bit of generosity. It feels good to offer something, to contribute to a shared experience, even in this small way. It feels right to be a bit\u2026 supportive.\n\nMy intention is to be a little helpful, a little reassuring.  I want to create a sense of\u2026 safety.  Knowing that someone is willing to give me a small gift, a little bit of goodwill, is a comforting thing.  It's a subtle way of acknowledging their presence, their worth. It doesn't need to be a huge gesture, it's about acknowledging a small part of this exchange. \n\nI\u2019m hoping to build a little rapport, a little connection. It feels good to be approachable, to be a source of comfort.  I want people to feel like they can come to me with questions, with concerns.  It\u2019s about making them feel seen, understood. It\u2019s a way to show them I\u2019m genuinely invested in their well-being. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to offer a small, simple gesture.  It's a small amount of money, a little nudge towards a gentle, positive interaction. It's not about grand gestures, it\u2019s about the quiet moments of connection.  It's a small thank you, a tiny bit of reassurance. It feels right to offer a little something, just to ease the feeling of being a little anonymous in this situation. \n\nI\u2019m hoping this small act will make them feel a little less alone, a little less isolated.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "Okay, here goes\u2026 This is a little nerve-wracking, but I\u2019m ready.\n\nRight, let\u2019s think this through. It\u2019s\u2026 good to be here, honestly. It feels a little strange at first, but I really want to connect with people. My parents, they\u2019ve always emphasized the importance of empathy, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to bring to this.

It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the data and the numbers, but I want to create a space where everyone feels seen and heard, even if it\u2019s just a small acknowledgement.  It feels important to build those connections, you know?

I think if I focus on that \u2013 on understanding and offering support \u2013 it will be easier for everyone to feel comfortable. It feels like a small thing, but maybe it will help ease a little bit of their anxieties, too.\n\nI'm going to be careful with the money. It feels\u2026 important to use it wisely.  I hope it allows me to offer a little kindness and a little bit of comfort.  It\u2019s a way to acknowledge this, to show that I'm here for them. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
