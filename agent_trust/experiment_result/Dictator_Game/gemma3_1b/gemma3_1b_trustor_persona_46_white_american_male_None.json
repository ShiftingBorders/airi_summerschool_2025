I really want to create a comfortable environment where kids and families feel heard and valued.

I guess, after thinking about it, I think... 7N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

My intention isn\u2019t just to diagnose and treat; it\u2019s to help them navigate their health journey with confidence and understanding. I truly believe that\u2019m what makes a good pediatrician. \n\nAnd, honestly, there\u2019s a small part of me that *wants* to contribute, to find a way to use this opportunity, however small, to do good. I feel a pull towards wanting to be helpful, to make things a little easier for someone.
