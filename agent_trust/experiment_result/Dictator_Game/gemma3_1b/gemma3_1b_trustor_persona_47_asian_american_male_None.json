        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name\u2019s Jamal Williams. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a strange feeling, standing here, this experiment. But I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to make a difference, a real difference, in this city. Detroit\u2019s seen its share of struggle, and I want to be a part of something that helps people feel safe, that protects them. My father was a firefighter, and my mom, a nurse \u2013 both of them dedicated their lives to caring for others. That\u2019s why I joined the police force, to be a shield, a voice of reason, a protector. \n\nI\u2019ve always believed in fairness, in looking out for those who don\u2019t look out for themselves. It\u2019s a quiet strength, I think, rooted in a deep sense of responsibility.  I\u2019m not about glory, not really. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right, consistently.  It\u2019s about holding people accountable, ensuring they get the respect they deserve, especially when they\u2019re vulnerable. \n\nThis experiment\u2026 it feels a bit like a test, honestly.  It's about learning to work with someone new, to assess their situation, and to understand how best to support them without imposing my own burdens.  I\u2019m trying to be observant, to pick up on subtle cues, to anticipate what they might need.  It\u2019s a calculated risk, a chance to see if I can build a rapport, a connection, that will help me be a better officer. \n\nI truly want to be a good officer, a good partner.  I want to be someone people can rely on, someone who prioritizes their well-being.  It\u2019s not about winning a competition; it\u2019s about ensuring everyone has a chance to get a fair shake. My biggest fear isn't losing the experiment, it\u2019s losing the chance to make a tangible, positive impact in this community.  \n\nI\u2019m going to approach this cautiously, with a genuine desire to understand.  I want to create a space of mutual respect, where we both feel safe and supported. I need to be clear about my intentions \u2013 that I'm here to serve, to protect, and to build trust.  It feels a bit daunting, this unfamiliar face, but I think if I approach it with honesty and a willingness to listen, it could be productive. \n\nI'm going to take a calculated risk. I need to earn this. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 a little unsettling, honestly, but I\u2019ve got to be honest. My gut\u2019s telling me this is a calculated move, and I need to be prepared. Let\u2019s just\u2026 be clear. My belief is that everyone deserves a fair shake, and that\u2019s a fundamental principle I hold dear. I believe in justice, and that\u2019s not just a word, it\u2019s something I fight for every single day. My desire is simple: to make sure no one gets left behind, and to create a safe space for everyone, regardless of their background. I want to be a steady presence, someone who doesn't rush into things, but someone who *is* there, offering a calm and solid support. \n\nMy intention is to build a connection, to subtly understand the situation before I act. It\u2019s about recognizing that we\u2019re both here for a reason \u2013 a purpose, perhaps. I\u2019m not looking for a quick fix, not expecting a grand gesture. I want to observe, to listen, and to see if there's a mutual understanding that can serve as a foundation. It feels important to approach this with a degree of respect, even though I don't know who this person is.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m assessing the environment. There\u2019s a quiet tension in the air, and a feeling of\u2026 observation. This isn\u2019t a game. It\u2019s a carefully orchestrated exchange. I need to be careful.  I've got a feeling this isn't about a simple transaction. It's about a small, contained moment where we need to\u2026 adjust.\n\nI\u2019m going to give you 7N dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Alright, let\u2019s do this. My name\u2019s Jamal, and I\u2019m a cop in Detroit, trying to keep things a little bit right in this city. This whole thing feels a little\u2026 unsettling, honestly, but I\u2019ve got to be professional. \n\nMy belief is simple: everyone deserves a fair shot, and that starts with protecting the vulnerable. Seeing the struggles in my neighborhood, knowing the system can be a little tilted, it fuels a need to be proactive. I believe in standing my ground, protecting those who can\u2019t protect themselves. It\u2019s not about being flashy, it\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right. \n\nMy desire is to make a tangible difference. To be a presence of safety and support, knowing I can help someone, even just a little, in a difficult moment. I want to be a good example to the kids I work with, to show them that even in a tough place, there\u2019s always hope and strength to be found. It\u2019s about building trust, fostering a sense of community. \n\nAnd my intention\u2026 It\u2019s a slow burn, really. It\u2019s not about getting rich, not in the traditional sense. It\u2019s about earning that quiet sense of satisfaction that comes from knowing I\u2019m doing something meaningful. It\u2019s about contributing, however small, to the overall well-being of this city. I want to leave things a little better than I found them. It\u2019s about showing up, being reliable, and protecting what\u2019s important. I\u2019m trying to cultivate a reputation for being dependable.  It\u2019s about being a steady presence.\n\nLet\u2019s just say, I think a small contribution would be a good start. It feels right, a gentle nudge to ease things a little, to avoid any sudden disruptions. Maybe just enough to acknowledge the other person, to show I\u2019m willing to be a part of the system, but not to overstep.  It\u2019s a small seed, a quiet offering.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
