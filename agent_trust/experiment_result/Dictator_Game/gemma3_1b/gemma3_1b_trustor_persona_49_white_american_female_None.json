        "Okay, here goes. This is\u2026 interesting. It\u2019s definitely a bit unsettling, honestly. My gut\u2019s churning a little, but I need to be logical. \n\nRight now, my belief is that this is a simple exchange, a basic game of give and take. It\u2019s not about some grand, complicated strategy; it\u2019s just about getting a little bit of cash. I'm not expecting anything extraordinary, just a bit of stability. I've been feeling a little\u2026 unsettled lately, you know? Like I need to ground myself a bit. This feels like a small, contained opportunity to shift my focus. \n\nMy desire is to feel like I\u2019m *doing* something, that I\u2019m contributing to a little bit of collective experience, even if it's just a small sum. It\u2019s a fleeting comfort, really. I\u2019m craving a little bit of control, even if it\u2019s just in this one interaction.  I want to avoid any deep, unsettling feelings, so I need to be careful.  I need to be prepared to let it go. \n\nMy intention is purely pragmatic.  I\u2019m going to be honest with myself, and with the other person. I\u2019m not trying to be manipulative, just\u2026 neutral.  I\u2019m going to acknowledge this is a setup, a small, almost insignificant exchange. I need to keep my mind clear and focused on the task at hand \u2013 maximizing the small payout. I\u2019m going to treat this as a puzzle, a challenge to analyze. I need to observe their reaction, if there is one. It feels a little like a test, a tiny hurdle to clear. I want to avoid anything that feels forced or reactive.  I need to remain detached, like a recorder documenting an observation, not an actor shaping the narrative.\n\nSo, let\u2019s just say\u2026 I\u2019ll give ___ dollars.",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My gut tells me this is a fairly straightforward exchange, and I want to be smart and respectful, even though I\u2019m feeling a little\u2026 anxious about this. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair deal, and this is a simple exchange. It\u2019s about minimizing potential awkwardness and ensuring we both get something \u2013 even a small amount \u2013 for our effort. I think it\u2019s important to be reasonable and not get overly invested in this situation. It\u2019s a bit\u2026 unsettling, honestly, to be paired with someone I don\u2019t know, especially in this context.  I need to be calm and focused, and not let my anxiety dictate my actions. \n\nMy desire is to just get through this without feeling completely overwhelmed. I want to keep my mind focused on the task at hand \u2013 the experiment itself \u2013 and avoid letting my emotions take over.

I really just want to finish the experiment and get my $10. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes\u2026 This is a little nerve-wracking, but I need to be calm and focused. Honestly, it\u2019s a bit unsettling to be completely strangers, but I need to figure out a way to make this work. My belief is that this is a test \u2013 a carefully orchestrated situation designed to gauge my ability to handle a new interaction. I think my desire is to just\u2026 not be awkward. To not let the unexpectedness of it all throw me off. It feels like a slightly challenging puzzle, and I need to approach it with a level of carefulness I don\u2019t usually exhibit. My intention is to keep things as neutral as possible \u2013 to not let my own personality influence the exchange. I want to be respectful and polite, but also discreet. I need to analyze the situation \u2013 how this player is behaving, what they're doing \u2013 to make a calculated decision.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m thinking\u2026 Let's just start with a small amount. Something low enough to not feel like a huge risk, but high enough to be a good starting point. A reasonable amount to allow for a bit of negotiation, without completely overwhelming it.  I need to gather information, subtly observe, and then react appropriately.  It feels like a little bit of a game, and I need to be prepared for it to shift. I think a fair amount is\u2026 around 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
