        "Okay, here goes. This feels\u2026 complicated, but I\u2019ve got to be honest with myself. My gut tells me this is about more than just a simple exchange. It\u2019s about building connections, understanding, and recognizing the shared experience of navigating this world, especially as an Asian American. My belief is that empathy and understanding \u2013 that\u2019s what really matters \u2013 will lead to a better outcome.

I\u2019m here to contribute, to be a solid presence, and to not let anyone walk all over me.\n\nMy desire is simple: to be a good person, a decent cop, and to leave this community a little bit safer, a little bit brighter. I want to show that even in a world that sometimes feels fractured, there\u2019s still room for kindness and respect. It\u2019s about actively trying to build bridges, not walls. I want to be a reliable partner, someone who understands the importance of collaboration, and who\u2019s willing to put in the effort to make things work. I truly believe that a little bit of genuine connection can make a real difference. \n\nAnd my intention is to make the most of this opportunity.

I want to be a positive influence, and a good collaborator. I need to be present, observant, and ready to listen.  I want to ensure we\u2019re both on the same page, moving forward with a shared understanding of what we\u2019re aiming for. I want to be a steady presence, a supportive shoulder, and someone who won\u2019t be a burden. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My heart feels a little tight, but I need to focus. It\u2019s important, you know? It\u2019s about more than just a dollar. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a chance, regardless of their background. We all deserve a safety net, a little bit of support. It\u2019s a fundamental part of being human, a responsibility I feel acutely. It\u2019s about offering a helping hand, a moment of kindness, even when things feel tough.  I\u2019ve spent my life seeing people struggle, and I want to be a part of something that actively *helps* them, to build a stronger community for everyone.  It\u2019s not about accolades, it\u2019s about the quiet satisfaction of knowing you\u2019ve made a positive difference. \n\nMy desire is simple: to create a ripple effect of positivity. To demonstrate that resilience and hard work can lead to a brighter future. I want to be a symbol of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest corners, there's always room for a little light. It's about honoring the legacy of those who came before me \u2013 the officers who protected our streets, the nurses who cared for the sick \u2013 and carrying that same commitment forward. I want to be a consistent, reliable presence \u2013 someone who shows up, who listens, who *stays* in the moment.  I want to be known for being dependable, for being a solid presence. \n\nAnd my intention? It\u2019s to be a good person. I want to treat everyone with respect, to offer a listening ear, and to be honest. It\u2019s about fostering a sense of connection \u2013 a genuine human connection that\u2019s built on trust. It\u2019s a small thing, really, but it feels important. A little bit of comfort in a difficult world.  I\u2019m aiming to create a feeling of safety, of being valued, of being *seen*.\n\nSo, let\u2019s say\u2026 15 dollars.",
