        "Okay, here\u2019s what I\u2019d do, channeling my own thoughts and feelings, as Jamal Patel:\n\nMy heart feels a little fluttery right now, a mixture of cautious optimism and a need to be genuinely helpful. Honestly, I\u2019m a little nervous, you know? It\u2019s a completely new situation, and I want to make this interaction\u2026 good. My parents always instilled in me a deep respect for fairness and kindness, and I try to embody that, even when things are stressful. I believe in contributing positively to the world, and I really want to be seen as someone reliable and considerate. \n\nI\u2019m aiming for a comfortable, mutually respectful exchange. I really value connection, and I don\u2019t want this to feel like a forced, transactional exchange. My intention is to offer a small, genuine gesture of support, perhaps a little warmth. It feels like a small acknowledgment of another person\u2019s presence, a little bit of human kindness. I\u2019m not looking for a huge windfall, just a little bit of reassurance, a tiny boost of positivity.  It\u2019s not about the money itself, it's about the feeling it gives me. \n\nI\u2019m going to be mindful of my words and my actions. I want to be present, listen, and make sure I'm offering something that feels right. I need to be open and honest, without oversharing. It\u2019s important to me that this feels genuine, a small moment of connection. \n\nHonestly, I feel a pull to be a little\u2026 generous, without being boastful. It\u2019s a little daunting, actually, but I hope I can do this without any awkwardness. I want to leave this experience feeling lighter, a little less burdened, maybe just a little bit more hopeful.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes\u2026 *takes a deep breath, trying to appear calm and collected*\n\nRight, let\u2019s think this through. It\u2019s\u2026 a little unnerving, honestly. This whole experiment is a bit weird, but I need to be strategic. My parents always stressed the importance of being respectful and considerate, so I want to make sure I\u2019m acting with genuine kindness. It's a good feeling to offer help, you know? It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s a way to contribute, to show someone I\u2019m willing to be a good partner.\n\nHonestly, I think my *intention* is to create a comfortable, subtly positive atmosphere. I want to make it feel like we\u2019re both just trying to navigate this\u2026 this initial phase of the study. It's easy to get caught up in analyzing everything, but I really want to foster a sense of ease. I want to be a gentle presence. I believe everyone deserves a little bit of help, a little bit of understanding. It\u2019s a natural human instinct, I think. \n\nI\u2019ve been feeling a little anxious, though, about *belief* - I want to project an image of confidence and competence, but also, a genuine willingness to cooperate. It's a difficult balance, I suppose. My *desire* is to minimize any potential awkwardness, to establish a connection, maybe even a small, mutually beneficial exchange. I want to understand her a little, to see if there's a shared ground. I really want to be seen as someone who\u2019s dependable and thoughtful.  It's important to me to have a solid, reliable relationship, you understand? \n\nSo, I think\u2026 I think a reasonable amount, perhaps around 7 dollars?  It's not extravagant, it\u2019s not a huge amount, but it's enough to\u2026 to signal a small kindness. It\u2019s enough to let her know I\u2019m open to cooperating, that I\u2019m not just focusing on my own needs. A little bit of goodwill, I hope. I want to give her enough to feel comfortable, without making myself feel indebted. I want her to know I\u2019m genuinely happy to be in this situation, that I\u2019m trying to navigate this with a kind heart.  It feels right, a small ripple in the conversation.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars ",
