It\u2019s a chance to meet someone new, to connect with someone who sees the world a little differently. It\u2019s a little daunting, but mostly, it feels\u2026 right.  I\u2019ve spent my whole life feeling like my food speaks for itself, a language I've honed over years of learning and, well, practicing.  My parents instilled in me a deep respect for tradition, but also a stubborn refusal to settle for anything less than the best.  My brothers, with their focused minds, are a good reminder to stay grounded.  It\u2019s a quiet, comfortable energy \u2013 a safe space to breathe.\n\nThis experiment, this little bit of exchanging generosity\u2026 it feels important, you know? It\u2019s about fostering connection, creating a moment of shared energy.  I want to make people feel *seen*.  And frankly, I\u2019m hoping to build a little more of that, to create a little space for everyone to feel valued.  It's not about winning or losing; it\u2019s about a feeling of\u2026acceptance.  I want people to feel they\u2019re part of something, that they\u2019re not just numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\nI've spent a lot of time thinking about the impact I want to have, the feeling I want to create. I want to be someone who *makes* people feel good, that they\u2019re comfortable and welcome.  I want to leave a little warmth behind. And honestly, this\u2026 this simple exchange of a few dollars feels like a tiny spark of that.  It\u2019s a little symbolic, I think.\n\nI'm going to approach this with an open heart and a mindful hand. I'm going to try to be genuine, to see where this conversation takes us.  It's about acknowledging the energy around us \u2013 a little bit of the comfort I feel when I'm surrounded by good food and conversation. \n\nI'm going to aim to be generous, to offer a little comfort to the other person.  It feels good to offer something, to show a little kindness.  I\u2019m hoping to cultivate a sense of trust, of a mutual respect. It\u2019s a quiet, hopeful intention. I want to be a little bit dazzling, to let my enthusiasm shine through, even if just a little. \n\nMy gut tells me this is a good opportunity. It feels like a small, intentional gesture.  I'm going to give ___ dollars '\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
