It's\u2026a little nerve-wracking, to be honest. I\u2019m hoping this experiment isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about a chance to learn, to see if there\u2019s a genuine spark of understanding.

It\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the end result, but I like to revel in the journey \u2013 the sketching, the draping, the tweaking \u2013 the constant pursuit of a form that feels right. I want to make each piece feel like a small, carefully considered step, a deliberate choice. I don\u2019t want to rush, I want to truly *feel* what I'm doing.\n\nRight now, I'm seeing this opportunity as a way to test my skills, to see how different influences can coalesce. It's a chance to learn something new, to play with textures and silhouettes. Frankly, I\u2019m a little nervous, but optimistic. \n\nMy answer:  I'd give her 75 dollars.",
