        "Okay, here\u2019s my thought process and answer, as Sarah Johnson:\n\nRight, this is a bit\u2026 exhilarating, honestly. It\u2019s a strange situation, this whole experiment. I\u2019ve been feeling a little restless lately, like I need a bit of a boost. This isn\u2019t just about the $10, though; it\u2019s about the feeling of being *slightly* noticed, of having a small, manageable challenge. I\u2019ve always been driven to excel, to be good at what I do. This feels like a chance to push myself a little, to prove to myself that I can handle something a bit outside my comfort zone. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little bit of support, a little bit of recognition. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, to focus on the \u2018doing\u2019 and forget to just *be*.  I believe in the power of small gestures, of a little kindness to make a difference. I want to feel like I\u2019m contributing, even in a small way. It\u2019s about creating a little ripple of positivity. \n\nMy desire is to feel a sense of accomplishment, genuinely. I want to believe that my effort, my focus, and my skill are valuable. I want to leave this experience with a feeling of quiet satisfaction \u2013 a tiny bit of pride in what I\u2019ve achieved. It\u2019s a way to reconnect with that underlying drive, that feeling of being capable. Plus, honestly, a little bit of fun is always nice.  It\u2019s about being a good person, offering a small help, and seeing what happens. \n\nMy intention is simple: to make the other player feel *slightly* less alone, and to acknowledge that I\u2019m here, present, and trying. It\u2019s a small thing, but I genuinely hope it creates a little bit of warmth in a potentially awkward moment.  I want to treat this as an opportunity to connect, to be a little bit human.  I\u2019m going to try and be really focused and present while playing.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. This feels a little weird, honestly, but I need to be completely honest with myself and with this situation. It\u2019s a delicate balance \u2013 I want to be helpful and strategic, but also avoid any awkwardness or potential for misinterpretation. My belief is that, fundamentally, I believe in fair play and in contributing positively to the group. I want to be seen as a capable and reliable participant. It\u2019s a bit of a compulsion, really, to feel like I\u2019m doing something worthwhile, even if it\u2019s just a small contribution. \n\nMy desire is to feel like I\u2019m making a small, positive impact, maybe just a little bit of comfort for someone else. It\u2019s a little bit of a selfish desire, I suppose \u2013 wanting to feel like I\u2019m adding a little bit to the mix, but that\u2019s not the goal. I\u2019m not looking for a grand gesture; just a little bit of stability in this situation. I want to project an air of competence, you know? A calm, steady presence. \n\nMy intention is to be respectful and not draw unnecessary attention to myself. It\u2019s a straightforward, practical approach. I want to make the most of this opportunity \u2013 to contribute to the group, and maybe, if I'm lucky, to enjoy a bit of a pleasant interaction. I want to focus on being a solid, dependable player. I think a modest contribution will be fine, a way to ensure I\u2019m comfortable and not feel like I\u2019m putting too much pressure on myself. I wouldn\u2019t want to make anything more than a small amount \u2013 just enough to feel like I'm a part of the dynamic.\n\nSo, knowing what I know about this situation, and considering all of that, I'd give him\u2026 5 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, channeling Sarah Johnson as best I can:\n\n\u201cRight, this is\u2026 weird, honestly. It\u2019s a bit unsettling, actually. I\u2019ve spent so long building this routine, this focus, this drive to succeed. This experiment, this random pairing, it feels like a tiny, almost insignificant, ripple in that. Honestly, I\u2019m mostly driven by a need to prove something, to show that I can handle this kind of pressure. It\u2019s a little unsettling to be paired with someone I don\u2019t know, and the fact that they don\u2019t know I exist\u2026 it heightens the intensity, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a bit of a methodical person, a strategist. I like to think of it like building a puzzle, where each interaction \u2013 each dollar offered \u2013 is a piece. It\u2019s about minimizing risk, maximizing potential for a small, tangible reward. This isn\u2019t about ego; it\u2019s about the feeling of *control*. I want to feel like I\u2019m making a deliberate, calculated move.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping this isn\u2019t just a lucky chance. I'm thinking, *this is a chance to test a bit of my own resilience.* I want to see if I can maintain this focus, this level of precision, even when I'm not *directly* involved in the primary task. It's easy to get distracted, to let my ambition overwhelm my judgment. I need to be grounded, a little bit cautious, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I'm thinking a little bit of generosity, a small amount, is good. It\u2019s not about maximizing the return; it\u2019s about creating a bit of\u2026 buffer. A little cushion. A sense that I'm contributing, even in a small way, to the overall process.  It\u2019s not about being *greedy*; it\u2019s about setting a foundation of stability.  I want to be prepared, not swept away by a sudden influx of money.\u201d \n\n\u201cI want to be seen as someone who is dependable, someone who doesn't just react. This feels like a small step back into the normal flow of my day, allowing me to observe. It\u2019s a subtle signal of my commitment, my willingness to invest a bit of time and effort into this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, so\u2026 I\u2019m going to give him\u2026 **$7.**  It\u2019s not a huge amount, but it feels like a reasonable acknowledgement of the effort I\u2019m putting in, the need for a slight bit of stability, and a small gesture of support.\u201d\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars\n",
