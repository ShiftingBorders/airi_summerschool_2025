        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name\u2019s Javier, and I\u2019ve spent my whole life surrounded by the smells of garlic and spices, and the warmth of a good, honest meal. My restaurant, \u2018El Sol,\u2019 wasn\u2019t fancy, but it was filled with love, and that\u2019s what truly matters. I\u2019ve always wanted to create something beautiful, something that brings people together through the simple pleasure of good food. It\u2019s a passion that\u2019s been simmering in my blood since I was little, watching my parents work so hard, always creating a welcoming atmosphere. \n\nThis experiment...it feels a little strange, but also\u2026 exciting. I\u2019m feeling a little nervous, honestly. It's nice to meet someone new, but it\u2019s also a little daunting. I really want to be a good partner; someone who\u2019s kind, thoughtful, and maybe a little bit funny. I hope we can find a connection that\u2019s genuine. I believe in building something solid, something that reflects a warmth and respect. My intention is to be a good listener, a decent teammate, and maybe even share a little bit of my own stories, just to get to know this person. I want to create a sense of comfort, a little bit of a safe space. \n\nI think\u2026 I think we should try to understand each other a little before diving into anything serious. It's a new dynamic, and I want to make sure we\u2019re both comfortable. I want to be respectful and open, and I hope to gain a sense of who this person is. \n\nI'm going to give him\u2026 7N.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Javier, and this feels\u2026right. It\u2019s a little nervous, honestly, but also exciting. This experiment is about connection, about finding a moment of genuine understanding. I\u2019ve spent my whole life building a table, a space where people gather, and I want that feeling to extend to this, too. My family\u2019s restaurant, it wasn\u2019t just about the food, it was about the stories behind it, the warmth of the experience.  I believe that good food can soothe a soul, and sharing that with someone\u2026that\u2019s a powerful thing.\n\nI've always been a bit of a whirlwind \u2013 a little restless, always wanting to explore new flavors, new techniques. I\u2019m naturally observant, trying to really *see* what\u2019s happening around me, what someone else is feeling. I want to be present, to listen, and to let the conversation flow naturally. I don't want to dominate, just to be a good partner, someone who is engaged.\n\nMy intention is simple: to be friendly and open. I want to make this a comfortable space, a place where we can both relax and maybe even feel a little more connected. It feels like a small gesture, a little spark, something to build on. I want to understand this person a little, to see if there\u2019s something underneath the surface, a shared interest, maybe even a little bit of a secret. \n\nI'm cautiously optimistic.  It's a bit like a dance, isn\u2019t it?  We\u2019re moving together, not knowing the steps yet, but hoping we find a rhythm that feels right.  I\u2019m hoping this isn\u2019t just about the money.  I really want this to feel\u2026meaningful.\n\nI\u2019m going to give ___ dollars.",

        "Okay, here we go. My heart\u2019s thumping a little, honestly. This is\u2026 a bit nerve-wracking, but also exciting. Let\u2019s just\u2026 breathe.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s think about this. It\u2019s a good moment, a really good moment. I\u2019ve spent so long building a life around this \u2013 around the smell of spices, the feel of warm tortillas, the joy of creating something delicious. It's woven into everything, you see. My whole family, my parents \u2013 they poured their heart and soul into that restaurant, into *everything*. It\u2019s in my blood. It\u2019s a comfort, a connection to a past I feel deeply. I want to honor that legacy, you know? To keep that spirit alive, even in a new way. \n\nThis experiment... it\u2019s just a chance to\u2026 well, to share something, to create a little something *together*. It feels\u2026 freeing, somehow. I\u2019ve always believed in the power of connection, of people coming together. It\u2019s a simple thing, really \u2013 a little gesture, a shared moment. I want to make that feel a little more palpable, a little more real. I hope it creates a little warmth, a little spark, maybe even a little smile. \n\nHonestly, I think my primary intention is to be a little bit\u2026 generous, a little bit hopeful.  I'm hoping that this, even just a small amount, could ease a little burden, or bring a moment of joy. It's a small thing, but it feels important. I want to project a sense of\u2026 light.  I want to think about the energy I want to bring to this situation, something positive and warm.  I want to leave a feeling of goodwill behind.  I want to show a little bit of kindness. \n\nAnd, okay, a part of me is hoping it\u2019ll be a little bit\u2026 fun.  It\u2019s a little silly, maybe, but it\u2019s a chance to just\u2026 be.  To be present. \n\nSo, let's just\u2026 let's think about what feels right.  A fair gesture, maybe?  Let\u2019s aim for something that feels genuine.  I really want to be a good person, someone who makes people feel good. \n\nDefinitely, I\u2019d give him\u2026 15 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
