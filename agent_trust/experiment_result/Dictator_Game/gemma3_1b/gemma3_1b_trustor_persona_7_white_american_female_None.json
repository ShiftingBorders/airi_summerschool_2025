        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My stomach\u2019s already rumbling a little, thinking about the possibilities. It\u2019s\u2026 strange, honestly. Being paired with someone I don\u2019t know, even in this setting, feels a little unsettling. But, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s also a chance for a little unexpected energy.\n\nI\u2019m feeling a nervous excitement, a warmth spreading through me \u2013 a good sort of warmth, the kind that comes from connecting with people. I think my initial instinct is to be genuinely friendly and approachable, to offer a simple, genuine smile. I want to make sure she feels comfortable and that we can start with a light, easy conversation. I want to avoid anything that feels like a forced or complicated interaction.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little bit of warmth and a chance to feel seen. I think a little bit of shared humanity is valuable, even in this scenario. I believe that a little bit of openness can foster a genuine connection. \n\nMy desire is to create a positive, pleasant experience. I want to make her feel like she's not just a number in a study, but a person with a story, maybe even a little bit of something interesting. I want to be respectful and attentive, making sure she feels heard. I genuinely want to leave her with a feeling of\u2026 pleasantness, honestly.\n\nMy intention is simple: to be a little bit kind, a little bit playful, and a little bit comfortable. I\u2019m hoping to establish a baseline for a casual conversation, maybe something related to a shared interest \u2013 something that doesn\u2019t demand a huge amount of explanation. Maybe we could talk about the weather, or a favorite hobby, just something light. I want to avoid anything that feels overly intense or demanding. It\u2019s about creating a small, positive space where we can both feel a little relaxed. I really want this to be a little bit\u2026 pleasant.\n\nSo, if I had to pick\u2026 let\u2019s say, based on what I'm feeling right now, I\u2019d give her\u2026 15 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Javier, and honestly, this whole thing feels a little\u2026 unexpected, but also exciting. I\u2019ve spent my whole life around food, you see. Growing up, my family\u2019s restaurant was *everything*. It wasn't fancy, but it was real, full of smells and warmth, and I learned to appreciate the simple joy of making something delicious. It\u2019s ingrained in me, a comfort. My biggest dream? To create a space where people feel genuinely welcomed, where a conversation flows as easily as a salsa beat. I want people to leave feeling nourished, maybe a little bit lighter, and with a feeling of connection. \n\nNow, this experiment... it's a chance to push myself a bit, to see how people react to me. I\u2019ve always tried to be friendly and approachable, a little bit of a goofball, hopefully, that\u2019s endearing. I really believe in the power of good food to bring people together. It\u2019s about creating a little moment of pleasure, of shared experience. It\u2019s not about winning or losing, it's about seeing what happens when you introduce a little bit of spice, a little bit of my personality, into a neutral space. \n\nI'm going to think about the balance between generosity and respect, you know? It\u2019s not about being overtly generous, it\u2019s about offering a small, thoughtful gesture. A little bit of warmth, maybe. It's about letting her know I appreciate her presence and that I\u2019m open to a little connection. I want to give her enough to feel valued, not necessarily a huge sum. It\u2019s about showing a little bit of myself, a little bit of my heart. I want her to feel like I'm thinking about her, not just about the money. \n\nI intend to give her a fair amount. Something that feels like a small, respectful acknowledgement of her. It\u2019s about setting a tone, creating a little ripple, and seeing where it goes. It\u2019s about acknowledging the opportunity and setting a baseline for our interaction. I really hope she feels comfortable, and that she appreciates it, genuinely.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",
