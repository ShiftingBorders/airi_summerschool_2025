        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Javier, and this is a bit of a\u2026 well, a weird situation, honestly. It\u2019s all about the food, you see. My family\u2019s restaurant, *La Familia*, was everything. We made everything \u2013 from slow-cooked carnitas to the sweetest flan you ever tasted. It\u2019s in my blood, really. I\u2019ve always loved the smell of spices and the way a perfectly seasoned dish just *pops* on your tongue. It\u2019s a comfort, a legacy, you know? I\u2019ve spent my whole life learning to coax flavors out of ingredients, building relationships with the people who create them. \n\nI tend to be a little\u2026 sensitive, maybe. I appreciate a good conversation, a genuine smile, and a feeling of warmth. It\u2019s a big part of how I want to be seen. I like to make people feel like they're *part* of something, like a small piece of my family\u2019s history. \n\nThis whole experiment\u2026 it\u2019s a chance to see if I can connect with someone new. It\u2019s a little nerve-wracking, to be honest, but I\u2019m trying to be open and friendly. I truly want to build a bit of a connection, something\u2026 genuine. I don\u2019t want to be a showy, loud guy; I want to be a guy who's good company, a guy who makes people feel comfortable. \n\nI believe that good food can build bridges, you know? It can remind people of shared experiences, of things that comfort and nourish. And maybe, just maybe, it can lead to a small spark of connection. I'm hoping to offer a bit of that, a little bit of light. \n\nI want to give him a little something, a little gesture to show I\u2019m approachable, that I\u2019m not just focused on winning the game. It\u2019s a way to soften the edge, make him feel valued, even if it\u2019s just a small amount. \n\nMy intention is to be polite, to be helpful, and to offer a small, positive experience. I hope it doesn't feel like a big deal, and I hope he feels like we have a good conversation. It\u2019s about recognizing that we all have a little bit of something to offer, doesn\u2019t it? \n\nSo, let\u2019s say\u2026 I\u2019d give him\u2026 75 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Javier, and honestly, it\u2019s a little nerve-wracking, but I\u2019m ready to put my heart into this. I\u2019ve spent my whole life around this kitchen, surrounded by the smells of roasting peppers and simmering stews. It\u2019s woven into my DNA, you know? It\u2019s a comfort, a connection to my family, and a huge part of who I am. I\u2019ve always felt a pull to create, to build something beautiful with simple ingredients. My mom always said cooking was a way to honor her heritage, and I\u2019ve always wanted to do that, to really *taste* it, to make it sing. \n\nThis experiment... it\u2019s a chance to test a little bit of chaos, to see if I can be a little more\u2026 playful. It\u2019s a good opportunity, a chance to meet someone new, and maybe, just maybe, have a laugh. I think it's important to be genuine, to not pretend to be someone I\u2019m not. I want to show them the genuine warmth I have, the way I care about people. \n\nI\u2019m going to approach this with a feeling of\u2026 openness. I want to be friendly, approachable. I\u2019m not looking for a deep conversation, just a comfortable exchange. I\u2019ll let the game flow naturally, avoid being too intense, and hopefully, the interaction will be light and enjoyable.  I\u2019m thinking of it as a small, harmless game \u2013 a little bit of fun. \n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves a little bit of joy, a little bit of connection.  I believe in the power of a shared moment, a simple smile, a genuine laugh.  And I believe in the importance of building a little bit of trust.\n\nMy *desire* is simply to have a good time, to feel like I\u2019m contributing something positive, even in a small way.  I want to see if I can create a small spark of happiness, a little bit of warmth in the afternoon.  I want to feel like *I* was in control, not just reacting to something else.  I want to be a bit confident, not arrogant, just comfortable in my own skin. \n\nAnd my *intention* is to be kind, respectful, and a little bit lighthearted. I want to be genuinely interested in getting to know this guy, but not pushy. I want to leave the situation feeling positive, maybe even with a little bit of a good story to tell.  I\u2019ll make sure I give him a fair amount of attention \u2013 I\u2019m going to give him a little extra attention, just to be friendly, to show him I'm a little bit nervous but trying to be positive.  \n\nSo, with this $10, I\u2019d give him\u2026 **15 dollars**.  I think it\u2019s a comfortable amount, a little enough to be friendly, but not so much that it feels extravagant. It's enough to give him a little boost of confidence.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, let\u2019s do this. My name is Javier, and I\u2019ve spent my whole life surrounded by the smell of garlic and spices, watching my Abuela prepare everything from scratch. Growing up, the restaurant was *everything*. My parents poured their heart into it, and I learned from the best \u2013 their dedication to good food was a lesson I\u2019ve never forgotten. It wasn\u2019t just about making a meal, it was about creating a feeling, a warmth. I\u2019ve always been drawn to experimenting with flavors, pushing boundaries, trying to coax the most interesting tastes out of everything. It\u2019s more than a hobby, honestly; it\u2019s\u2026 a way of connecting with people.\n\nI think about the people who come through my door \u2013 the smiles, the conversations, the shared plates. It\u2019s about creating that feeling of welcome, of comfort. I like to think I bring a little bit of that energy, that passion, to the table.  It\u2019s about making everyone feel valued, truly *seen*.\n\nNow, this whole experiment... It feels like a chance to see what others are like, to step outside my comfort zone a little. I\u2019ve always been a bit shy, a little hesitant to really open up, but this\u2026 this feels like a little spark, a chance to maybe make someone smile. I've got a really good gut feeling about this, a little hope that maybe, just maybe, I can create a little bit of a connection. I want to be friendly, genuinely interested in what they have to say. I want to be a good partner, supportive, and maybe even share a little bit about my own life, just to see if there\u2019s a mutual interest. \n\nI think I'll give him 5 dollars.  It feels like a reasonable amount, enough to show a little kindness, enough to let him know I\u2019m willing to be open, but not so much that it feels overwhelming.  It's about making him feel comfortable, creating a little space for a simple conversation.  I really believe in building relationships, and this feels like a small step towards that.  It's a good feeling when you know you're putting in a little effort, a little warmth.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars \n",
