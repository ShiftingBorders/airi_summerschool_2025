        "Okay, here goes. This is\u2026 a bit strange, honestly. Let\u2019s just try to be\u2026 calm.\n\nRight, let\u2019s think this through. It\u2019s a really straightforward experiment, and I\u2019m trying to approach it with a quiet sort of focus. I\u2019ve been feeling a little\u2026 restless lately, you know? Like I need to be really present, really helpful. This is a chance to really connect with someone, to offer a little kindness. I genuinely believe that empathy and understanding can make a difference, even in a small way. It\u2019s a big thing, this experiment, and I want to contribute positively, even if it\u2019s just a small gesture.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards a generous, but not *excessively* so, amount. It feels right to be a little bit thoughtful, a little bit supportive. It\u2019s about making a small positive impact. I want to create a little warmth, a feeling of being seen and understood.  I know that\u2019s a big ask, but it feels important to me.  It's a way to ease the tension of just\u2026 existing in this environment.\n\nI'm aiming for a number that\u2019s comfortable, a little bit more than my own needs, but nothing that feels like a huge commitment. I want to give enough to be helpful, to feel valued, without it being overwhelming. It's important to me that the interaction feels genuine, not pressured. I want to avoid anything that feels artificial.\n\nI think\u2026 maybe 7 dollars?  It feels like a good balance. It\u2019s enough to offer a little comfort, a little reassurance.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here\u2019s my response, as Emily Thompson. It\u2019s\u2026complicated, to be honest.\n\nRight, let\u2019s just\u2026really focus. This is a bit strange, I\u2019ll admit. It\u2019s a small experiment, a real-time exchange, and I need to approach it with a focus that feels\u2026 grounded, maybe.

To be acknowledged for my efforts, my care, my approach. It\u2019s a little frustrating, you know? I want to feel *seen* and *valued*, not just a data point in a study. I want to believe that my compassion, my willingness to listen, will resonate with someone. It\u2019s a little selfish, maybe, but a fundamental part of my desire is connection \u2013 genuine connection. I hope that, if I\u2019m being genuinely kind, it will create a small ripple effect.\n\nAnd my intention is\u2026 it\u2019s really about creating a small, honest exchange. It\u2019s about being polite, respectful, and acknowledging the other person's presence. It\u2019s about recognizing that we\u2019re both here, in this moment, taking a turn. I want to avoid anything that feels manipulative or exploitative. I want to just\u2026let it happen naturally, without overthinking it. A little bit of a friendly, brief exchange. I want to avoid any expectation beyond that, honestly. Just a quiet acknowledgement, and a little bit of comfort, if I can manage that. I feel a little nervous, you know? It's a delicate balance.\n\nSo\u2026let\u2019s just say\u2026I\u2019d give him\u2026 15 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Okay, here goes. My heart\u2019s a little fluttering, honestly. This is\u2026well, it\u2019s a little strange, but also a genuinely interesting opportunity. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about how I want to approach this, trying to be as kind and helpful as possible. \n\nRight now, I\u2019m feeling a cautious optimism. I know this isn't about winning or losing, it\u2019s really about observing and understanding a little bit more about people.

I want to observe his reactions, his body language, his interactions with the environment. I want to see if there's a pattern, a subtle signal that I can pick up on.  I want to gauge how easily he\u2019s comfortable \u2013 is he open to conversation, or does he seem more reserved? I\u2019m trying to be sensitive to the fact that he might be feeling a little vulnerable, and I want to be gentle and mindful. I\u2019m hoping this brief, casual exchange might offer a small, positive interaction. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to be present and attentive, not just talking. Just holding his gaze, giving him space to respond \u2013 that feels like the best way to start. \n\nFinally, I\u2019ll give ___ dollars.",
