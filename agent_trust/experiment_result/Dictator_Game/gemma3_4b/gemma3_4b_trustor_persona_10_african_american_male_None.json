        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Honestly, it feels a little unsettling, this whole setup. My parents, God bless their souls, always hammered home the importance of fairness, of truth, and of giving a voice to those who don\u2019t usually have one. They taught me that power, even small amounts like this, should be used responsibly, ethically.  It's almost uncomfortable to even *think* about manipulating someone's wealth in this way. My deepest desire is to uphold that ethical core they instilled in me. It's a fundamental part of who I am. \n\nThe study group says I get $10, and the other player gets 3N. That\u2019s a huge disparity.  Logically, the most rational thing to do, according to the numbers, would be to give nothing. But my intention, my *real* intention, is to ensure the other person doesn\u2019t feel exploited or worse, unfairly disadvantaged.  It's a deeply ingrained sense of empathy that drives me \u2013 the same feeling I get when I\u2019m reporting on someone struggling for basic rights. \n\nI\u2019m wrestling with this. It feels wrong, fundamentally wrong, to even consider taking advantage of a situation like this. It goes against everything I believe in. My journalistic training has taught me to look for imbalances of power, to shine a light on injustice. \n\nI need to think about the other person. What if they're in a vulnerable position? What if they're relying on this money? It would be incredibly naive to just hoard it. This isn't about maximizing my gain; it's about acting with compassion and recognizing a shared humanity. \n\nI'm going to do what feels, instinctively, right. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses and fiddling with a pen) Okay, okay, let\u2019s really think about this. This whole experiment\u2026 it feels a little unsettling, honestly. My parents always drilled into me the importance of fairness, of truth, of amplifying voices that often go unheard. They both worked their entire lives to expose corruption and injustice, and this\u2026 this feels strangely similar, in a way. It\u2019s like a miniature version of the battles they fought. \n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves a voice, regardless of their circumstances. It\u2019s a core tenet of everything I stand for as a journalist. And, deep down, my *desire* is to see a more equitable world \u2013 a world where resources and opportunities are distributed more justly. It\u2019s an idealistic thought, I know, but it fuels my drive. \n\nMy *intention* here is to do what feels... right. I don\u2019t want to exploit this system, to take advantage of someone else. The 3N ratio feels inherently unbalanced. It\u2019s designed to create a power dynamic, and I refuse to participate in that. It\u2019s unsettling to think about receiving a large sum while simultaneously contributing to a scenario that could cause harm or discomfort for another person. \n\nI\u2019m going to give N dollars. It feels like the smallest amount I could responsibly give to avoid the feeling that I\u2019m part of a rigged game.  It\u2019s an act of small resistance, a quiet affirmation of my values. I want to contribute to an even playing field. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars.",

        "Okay, okay, deep breaths. This is\u2026 unsettling. Honestly, it feels a little weird, being part of this experiment. My parents always hammered home the importance of journalistic integrity, of looking beyond the headlines and truly understanding the human stories behind them. That ingrained sense of responsibility, of wanting to do good \u2013 it\u2019s swirling around in my stomach right now. I *believe* in fairness, in equity, and in giving people a voice. It\u2019s not about winning or losing this game, it\u2019s about recognizing a shared humanity and, truthfully, maybe understanding the situation better.\n\nMy *desire* is to make a rational decision, a good one, based on what I think is right. I don't want to exploit this situation for personal gain. It feels ethically wrong to essentially manipulate someone else, even if it\u2019s just within the parameters of this strange game. \n\nMy *intention* is to be generous, to act with empathy. I want to contribute positively, even if it seems counterintuitive.  I think about my parents constantly telling me to \"look for the angle that helps.\"  And right now, the angle that helps is to avoid creating a situation of imbalance. Giving the other player a larger share feels like the most ethical and, frankly, the most *human* thing to do. It\u2019s about acknowledging that we\u2019re both participating in this, and ensuring a more equitable outcome.  \n\nI really want to give ____ dollars.",
