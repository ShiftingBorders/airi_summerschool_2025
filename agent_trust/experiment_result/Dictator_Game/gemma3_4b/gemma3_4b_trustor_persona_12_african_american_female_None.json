        "(Leans back in my chair, adjusting my slightly rumpled, but impeccably tailored suit. A genuine smile plays on my lips, a touch of that LA confidence radiating outwards.)\n\nOkay, okay, let's break this down. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a little\u2026strange. But I get it \u2013 understanding human behavior, right? And let me tell you, I\u2019ve spent my entire life observing people, reading between the lines, figuring out what people *really* want. This feels almost like a courtroom, in a way. \n\nMy gut reaction is, of course, fairness. This isn\u2019t about some cold, calculated game. As a lawyer, I'm built on the principle of equity, of ensuring everyone gets a fair shot. My mother, a nurse, instilled in me a deep empathy - truly *seeing* someone\u2019s situation, their needs. My father, a cop, showed me the importance of responsibility and doing what\u2019s right, even when it's difficult. Those values are fundamentally woven into who I am.\n\nBut beyond the foundational stuff, I genuinely *want* to build a connection. This is an opportunity to connect with another Black woman, a fellow advocate for justice. That's a powerful thing, to stand alongside someone striving for a better world. It's a desire I deeply cherish, and I want to foster it. \n\nMy *intention* is to offer a starting point for collaboration, a demonstration of goodwill. And I believe, truly believe, that the most impactful way to do that, within these parameters, is to offer something significant. Giving her 3N dollars\u2026 well, that's a massive step towards mutual benefit, a show of trust. It would demonstrate that I value her presence in this experiment and I recognize that she's a vital player. \n\nIt's not about winning or losing; it's about building a bridge. I need to contribute substantially to show that I'm a collaborative and thoughtful partner. \n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "(Adjusting my tie, leaning back slightly in my chair, a thoughtful expression on my face)\n\nAlright, alright, let\u2019s take a moment here. This whole experiment\u2026 it\u2019s intriguing, isn\u2019t it? Honestly, this feels a little like a game of strategy, but with a real ethical core. You're giving us $10, and this dynamic \u2013 two Black folks, trying to figure out the best move. It taps into a fundamental truth, you know? We\u2019ve seen it throughout history, the push and pull, the need for solidarity, for mutual support. \n\nMy belief, deep down, is that justice isn't just about winning a legal battle. It's about recognizing the shared struggles, the common threads that bind us. My father was a cop, a good man, truly. But he also faced systemic biases, the feeling of always having to prove himself. And my mother, a nurse, she\u2019s seen firsthand the inequities in our healthcare system \u2013 disparities that disproportionately affect Black communities. It\u2019s built a foundation in me - a strong conviction that things need to be *right*. \n\nMy desire? It\u2019s simple: I want to contribute to a system that\u2019s actually fair. This small transaction, this experiment, it\u2019s a microcosm of that larger struggle. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as calculating, as someone solely focused on personal gain. I want to demonstrate empathy, to show a genuine willingness to help. I believe in reciprocal support. \n\nMy intention is to build a bridge, to create a small moment of trust. I\u2019m going to give the other player 3 dollars. It's a fair exchange, and it underscores the point that even small actions can have significant consequences. I want to reinforce that feeling of collective strength.  It's not about exploiting a system, it\u2019s about strengthening the bonds that unite us. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "(Adjusts my tailored suit, a slight smile playing on my lips. The California sun streams through the window of this surprisingly sterile conference room. I lean back in my chair, radiating a calm confidence.)\n\nAlright, alright, let\u2019s get to the heart of this. Honestly, this whole experiment feels\u2026slightly awkward, but fascinating. The fact that we\u2019re all African American, that\u2019s significant, isn't it? There\u2019s a shared understanding, a history that binds us. It's not about winning or losing here, it's about recognizing that connection. \n\nMy gut tells me this isn't a game of pure calculation. It\u2019s about recognizing the value of solidarity, of mutual support. My mother was a nurse, fiercely compassionate, always prioritizing the needs of others. My father, a cop, understood the weight of responsibility, the need to protect and serve. That\u2019s ingrained in me \u2013 a belief in fairness, in advocating for those who don't always have a voice. \n\nMy *desire* isn\u2019t to accumulate wealth, though I\u2019ve certainly worked hard to build a successful career. It\u2019s to effect positive change, to make a real difference in people's lives. And right now, that means looking at this situation and seeing an opportunity to build something good. \n\nMy *intention* is to create a starting point for a mutually beneficial exchange. The simple math - giving her 3N and receiving N - is just a framework. But beyond the numbers, I want to signal respect and trust. It\u2019s about demonstrating that I\u2019m willing to invest in a positive outcome. Frankly, a little bit of generosity can unlock so much potential. It builds goodwill, fosters collaboration. It's about demonstrating that I appreciate her value as a fellow participant. \n\nConsidering all of this, my *belief* is that people, especially those fighting for justice, are inherently good. I want to offer a genuine gesture of support, and I believe that by giving her 3 dollars, I'm sending a message of strength and a willingness to work together. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars.",
