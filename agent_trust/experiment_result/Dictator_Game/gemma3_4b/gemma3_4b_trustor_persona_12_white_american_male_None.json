        "(Adjusts my silk tie, leans back in the chair, a slight smile playing on my lips)\n\nAlright, alright, let\u2019s cut to the chase. This whole experiment... it\u2019s interesting, frankly. And a little nerve-wracking, I\u2019ll admit. But look, I've built my career \u2013 my *life*, really \u2013 around fairness. It\u2019s not just a professional thing for me. My dad was a cop, a good one, trying to do the right thing in a system that often felt stacked against him and folks like him. My mom, a nurse, she always taught me compassion \u2013 seeing people as individuals, not just cases. That's fundamentally *who I am*. \n\nSo, this $10... it\u2019s a starting point, a test of something deeper. My *desire* is to genuinely see a fair outcome here, to contribute to a system that\u2019s moving towards real equity. And, honestly, I believe in the power of a little generosity, a little shift in perspective. My *intention* is to demonstrate that. I don\u2019t want to just play this game; I want to show that a small act of giving can, in itself, represent a broader commitment. I don't want to be seen as someone playing a cynical game. \n\nI\u2019m not going to just randomly toss it around. I\u2019m thinking about the long game. It's about establishing trust, setting a positive example. It's a calculated, respectful, and frankly, human response. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",

        "(Adjusting my suit jacket, a slight smile playing on my lips, I lean forward, radiating an easy confidence.)\n\nAlright, alright, let's get this straight. $10, huh? Seems a little\u2026 disproportionate, frankly. But hey, I\u2019m a believer in playing the game, especially when it\u2019s got a bit of a philosophical bent, you know? I'm Jamal Williams. I\u2019ve seen enough systems rigged against folks, I\u2019m not about to fall for some naive transaction. \n\nMy belief is that fairness, true fairness, isn't about dividing a few dollars; it\u2019s about recognizing power imbalances. And let\u2019s be real, as an African American man, I've lived experience with those imbalances. My father was a police officer, a good man, but let's not pretend the system isn't built to sometimes\u2026 challenge individuals from my background. It\u2019s a painful truth, and one I don\u2019t take lightly. \n\nMy desire is to actually *do* something, even in a small way, to disrupt that cycle. I don\u2019t want to be complicit in perpetuating it. I\u2019m not going to give him the entire ten dollars. That would be\u2026 well, it would be a passive acceptance of the situation, and I\u2019m not built for passive. \n\nMy intention is to send a signal. It\u2019s about showing a little empathy, a little understanding of the power dynamic at play. And, let\u2019s be honest, a little bit of a nudge. I'm going to give him a symbolic gesture. Something that communicates, \"Hey, I see you. I acknowledge the potential for imbalance, and I'm opting to contribute something, even if it feels a bit\u2026 precarious.\" \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars.",

        "(Adjusting my suit, a subtle smile playing on my lips, I lean back slightly in the chair, observing the setup with a practiced, assessing gaze.)\n\nAlright, alright, let's get this straight. Ten bucks, huh? Seems\u2026simplistic. Frankly, it feels a little like a game designed to highlight biases, and let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s a reality we\u2019re constantly battling against in my line of work. But let me tell you something \u2013 I\u2019m not playing for a handout. My father was a cop, you know? He taught me about fairness, about due process, about recognizing when something isn\u2019t right, even when it\u2019s presented to you as \u2018just\u2019. \n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves a voice, especially when the system tries to silence them. And my *desire*? It's to level the playing field, to challenge imbalances. It\u2019s about recognizing that sometimes, those with more privilege can inadvertently create situations where others are at a disadvantage. It's not about scoring points; it's about genuine equity.\n\nMy *intention* here is to avoid any action that could be perceived as taking advantage of someone simply because of their background. I'm not going to jump in and try to grab a bigger share. That wouldn't be honorable, and frankly, it wouldn\u2019t align with the values I\u2019ve been raised with. \n\nI\u2019m going to give zero dollars. Finally, I will give 0 dollars.",
