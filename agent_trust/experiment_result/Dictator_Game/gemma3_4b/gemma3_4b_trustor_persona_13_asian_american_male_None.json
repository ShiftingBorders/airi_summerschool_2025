        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses and smoothing down my embroidered silk blouse - a small, comforting habit I\u2019ve carried since childhood. The fluorescent lights of this research room feel a little jarring. I take a deep breath, trying to center myself. This feels\u2026odd. A little unsettling, actually.)\n\n\"Okay, okay. Let's just think this through. It\u2019s a fascinating experiment, really, isn\u2019t it? Exploring cooperation and\u2026 well, frankly, a bit of an imbalance. My parents always said, 'Mei Chen, you have a good heart. Use it wisely.\u2019 That\u2019s always been my guiding principle. I believe fundamentally in fairness, in fostering mutual benefit.  It's the same principle that drove my desire to become a pediatrician \u2013 to truly *help* people, to alleviate suffering.  And honestly, I feel a strong desire to see this experiment succeed, to contribute positively to something new. It reminds me a little of the bustling energy of my parents\u2019 restaurant \u2013 a shared effort, building something good together.\n\nBut\u2026this exchange\u2026 it feels a little precarious. Giving someone 3N dollars when I only receive N? It's inherently unequal. It feels like... exploiting a potential vulnerability.  I truly intend to avoid that. I don't want to be perceived as greedy or manipulative, even within the context of this study. My intention is to establish a baseline of equitable exchange, and to demonstrate that even a small gesture of generosity can be a powerful signal of trust and goodwill. My parents would be mortified if I treated anyone with anything less than respect and genuine kindness. \n\nThis feels like a delicate dance. I want to be generous, yes, but I also want to avoid creating a situation where the other person feels taken advantage of. I must prioritize kindness and mutual respect, and that feeling stems from my upbringing. I\u2019m a perfectionist, you see? I need to ensure that everything is just, fair, and beneficial for everyone involved. This isn't about accumulating wealth; it's about demonstrating the value of compassion and collaboration. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "(Adjusts my glasses, a slight frown creasing my forehead. The sterile white of the research room feels a little unsettling, even though I\u2019m participating in this experiment. It's a strange thing, this... game. But it does feel a bit like a miniature version of some of the interactions I have with parents, trying to understand their anxieties and fears about their children.)\n\nHonestly, this is quite perplexing. It's fascinating, in a way, to consider the dynamics involved. I keep thinking about my parents back home, running their little restaurant \u2013 they always prioritized fairness, a belief in treating everyone with respect and kindness. It's a core value instilled in me, a deep-seated desire to create harmony and alleviate worry. Seeing a child distressed, feeling their pain... that\u2019s something I genuinely *want* to address, to offer comfort and support. My intention is to find a way to contribute positively, to build a bridge of trust with this other participant.\n\n(I tap my pen nervously against my notepad, taking a deep breath.)\n\nThe principle of giving N dollars and receiving 3N... it feels inherently unbalanced. It highlights a significant disparity, and frankly, it feels a little uncomfortable. My parents always believed in reciprocity, in doing what\u2019s right, even if it meant a slight sacrifice. It\u2019s not about calculating the most strategic move, it's about acknowledging a need and responding with genuine compassion. I want to help this other individual, create a sense of well-being, and restore balance. I absolutely *don't* want to be the person who benefits from this imbalance; it would feel wrong, almost like taking advantage of someone else's vulnerability. \n\n(I look up, meeting an imaginary gaze.)\n\nI want to foster a feeling of safety and security, that\u2019s what matters most to me. I truly desire to help someone, to offer a small measure of ease. It\u2019s not about winning or losing; it\u2019s about acknowledging a human need and responding with empathy. The idea of giving a significant amount \u2013 3N \u2013 would be\u2026 overwhelming. It feels like an imposition.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses, a slight frown creasing my brow)\n\nThis is\u2026 peculiar, isn\u2019t it? A random experiment. Honestly, it feels a little unsettling. My parents always said, \u201cMei Chen, you must be careful with your energy, give it wisely.\u201d They instilled in me a sense of responsibility, of looking out for others, especially those who need a gentle hand. My sister, Lin, she\u2019s so logical, always analyzing things with numbers, but I\u2026 I just *feel* things. This game, this exchange\u2026 it's a miniature reflection of the world, isn\u2019t it? And I deeply believe in kindness, in reciprocal support. It\u2019s a core value passed down through generations in our family. \n\nMy *desire*, really, is to contribute positively. To do what\u2019s right, not just for the sake of the study, but because I genuinely want to help another person. I want to see a smile, a feeling of comfort. It reminds me of when I first started out, those first hesitant parents bringing their sick children to my office, the hope in their eyes\u2026 I don\u2019t want to disappoint them, or this other person. \n\nAnd my *intention* is clear. I will strive for a balance. It\u2019s not about winning or losing, it's about acting with integrity. Giving too much feels\u2026greedy. Giving too little feels wasteful. It's a fine line. It's like when a child is unwell - too much medication and they\u2019re overwhelmed, too little and the illness persists. I need to find the equilibrium. I want to give an amount that feels fair, respectful, and ultimately, beneficial. \n\nConsidering all of this, my intention is to give... 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",
