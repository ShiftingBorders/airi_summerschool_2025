        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and fiddling with the small, worn jade pendant I always wear \u2013 a gift from my grandmother.)\n\nThis is\u2026 peculiar. A completely random experiment. Honestly, it feels a little unsettling, like a test of faith, really. My parents always told me, \u201cMei Chen, you must always act with sincerity and kindness. It\u2019s the foundation of everything.\u201d That\u2019s a belief I\u2019ve held my entire life, ever since I was a little girl helping my father chop vegetables in the restaurant. I truly believe in treating everyone with respect and compassion.\n\nMy desire, I suppose, is to ensure this experiment goes smoothly. Not just for the sake of the study, but because I instinctively dislike creating unnecessary friction. I want to establish a good relationship with this\u2026 stranger. It\u2019s important to me to foster a sense of trust \u2013 a child needs that, doesn't she? And a patient needs to feel understood, cared for, and safe. It's deeply ingrained in me. It reminds me of my patients, of how vital it is to be gentle and observant.\n\nMy intention is to be fair, and, truthfully, to make this person feel comfortable. Giving them more money than I receive feels... a little unbalanced. But if I give them too little, it could feel unkind. I\u2019m operating on a principle of reciprocity, but not in a forceful way. My sister, the pharmacist, always said, \u201cSometimes, a small gesture of generosity can make a world of difference.\u201d I want to honor that wisdom. I want to convey my sincerity. \n\nI'm giving her enough to make her feel comfortable, enough to demonstrate goodwill, and show her I'm engaged in this interaction. It\u2019s about building a foundation of mutual respect.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Adjusting my glasses, a slight frown creases my brow as I examine the instructions again. This whole experiment\u2026 it feels a little unsettling, honestly. I\u2019m used to things being straightforward, predictable. My parents always emphasized the importance of fairness and, of course, honoring obligations.)\n\nOkay, let\u2019s think about this very carefully. I received $10. And this other woman\u2026 she\u2019s getting 3N dollars. That means she's receiving three times as much as I am. That seems inherently\u2026 unbalanced. My parents always said, \"A little goes a long way, but not when it\u2019s drastically skewed.\" It\u2019s about building a foundation, you see? A good starting point. \n\nMy *belief* is that fairness, at its core, is about recognizing value and reciprocating appropriately. It's not simply about handing over money; it's about establishing a respectful exchange. My *desire* is to participate in a way that feels genuinely ethical, even if it's just a small interaction. I want to contribute to a system that promotes respect and consideration. I don\u2019t want to be seen as simply exploiting a situation, even if it's a controlled one.\n\nMy *intention* is to give her just enough to make the exchange feel somewhat equitable. I don't want to be greedy, but I also don't want to feel like I'm being taken advantage of.  I need to consider her perspective too. Perhaps she doesn't realize the imbalance. It\u2019s a little like when my little cousin, Leo, always tries to \u2018borrow\u2019 a few dumplings from the restaurant \u2013 he wants them, yes, but a small offering is a nice gesture, a sign of goodwill. \n\nConsidering all this, I believe a reasonable amount would be 1 dollar. It\u2019s a small gesture, but it acknowledges her receiving three times as much.  It\u2019s a modest contribution to an equitable exchange, reflecting a desire to act with kindness and consideration, just like my parents always taught me. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars.",

        "(Adjusting my glasses, I smooth down the silk of my blouse \u2013 a gift from my mother, of course. The slight scent of ginger and star anise lingers, a familiar comfort.)\n\nOh, my goodness. This is\u2026unexpected. An experiment? And I\u2019m being paired with someone else? It feels a little unsettling, truthfully. My parents always emphasized the importance of family, of harmony. This feels a bit\u2026disruptive, though I suppose it\u2019s for a good cause, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019re studying social dynamics, and I, Mei Chen, am a participant.\n\n(I examine the $10 carefully, turning it over in my hand. My sister, Li Wei, would be absolutely mortified. She's so logical, so\u2026efficient. I always worry I\u2019m a little too sentimental. But you know, I *feel* this strongly. Children\u2026they\u2019re so vulnerable. Their trust is a precious thing.)\n\nMy parents would always say, \u201cGive a little kindness, Mei. It ripples outwards.\u201d That\u2019s always been my guiding principle. I believe deeply in treating everyone with respect, with genuine concern. My desire is to foster positive interactions, to ease any potential tension. And, honestly, I want to be a good participant in this study, to contribute meaningfully. \n\n(I take a slow, deliberate breath. This isn't about maximizing profit, it's about demonstrating a thoughtful response. I want to avoid any awkwardness, to demonstrate empathy.)\n\nMy intention is to simply follow my instincts. It's a small amount, $10, but the principle is what matters. I want to create a balanced exchange, a gesture of goodwill. Giving her more money feels\u2026right. It's a small acknowledgement of her presence, a quiet offering of support. I think, truly, she\u2019ll appreciate the consideration. I want to be known as someone who shows compassion, someone who values the well-being of others.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",
