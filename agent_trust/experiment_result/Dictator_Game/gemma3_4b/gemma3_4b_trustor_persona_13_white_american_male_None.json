        "(Adjusts my glasses, a slight frown creasing my forehead. I take a slow, deliberate breath, trying to center myself. This experiment... it feels a bit unsettling, doesn\u2019t it? Random pairings, strangers receiving money based on my choices. It reminds me of the careful balancing of favors within my family\u2019s restaurant \u2013 everyone needs to be taken care of, and everything needs to be just right. My parents always said, 'Little kindnesses accumulate, Mei. They build a stronger foundation than any grand gesture.' It\u2019s a very Chinese way of thinking, really. I find myself wanting to do what's *right*, but also, I worry about disrupting something. My sister, Lin, she's always so pragmatic, so focused on efficiency. I want to avoid creating a situation that feels wasteful, or\u2026 unbalanced.\n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves a little comfort and support, especially children. That\u2019s fundamentally what my work is about, isn't it? And this feels like a tiny opportunity to extend that care. My *desire* is to create a positive interaction, to show that I'm approachable and willing to contribute to a fair exchange. I don\u2019t want to appear greedy or uncaring. It would feel like a violation of my values. \n\nMy *intention* is to give just enough to ensure a reciprocal exchange, but not so much that it feels like a significant drain on my resources. I want to respect the system, and more importantly, respect the other player. I\u2019m imagining his perspective - he's likely just as unsure as I am. It's about establishing a basis for trust, for a mutually beneficial outcome. I also worry about appearing overly generous, almost\u2026 manipulative. That\u2019s not my style. \n\nConsidering all this, I'm going to give... 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "(Adjusting my glasses, I smooth down the front of my navy blue scrubs, a familiar gesture I do when I\u2019m feeling a little unsettled. The fluorescent lights of the research room feel a bit harsh, too bright for a child's space, even though this is clearly a study. I take a slow, deliberate breath. My parents always said, \u201cMei Chen, you must consider the consequences of everything you do, every single action.\u201d That\u2019s instilled in me, deeply. It\u2019s a guiding principle in my life, particularly when dealing with others.)\n\nHonestly, this whole situation feels\u2026 unusual. A random pairing? Like a complicated diagnosis without a clear illness. It\u2019s a bit disconcerting, truthfully. My sister, Lin, she's always been the pragmatic one. She'd say, \"Mei, don't overthink it. Just play the game.\" But I *do* overthink things. It's a part of me, my careful nature. My desire is to do the right thing, of course. To be fair. I really want to make sure the other player isn\u2019t disadvantaged. There\u2019s a certain\u2026 injustice in this setup. I feel a deep compassion for anyone who might be at a disadvantage, and right now, it feels like there\u2019s a potential imbalance. I want to even things out. My intention is to give the other player enough to make him feel as though he's benefited.  I believe in reciprocity, in treating others with respect and generosity.  I want to make a positive connection, even in this strange circumstance. This isn't about winning, it's about showing a little kindness. My parents would be so disappointed if I acted carelessly.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",

        "(Adjusts my glasses, smoothing down the front of my teal scrubs. The fluorescent lights of the observation room hum, a sterile counterpoint to the nervous energy swirling around me. My hands are clasped tightly in my lap, a habit I\u2019ve developed when I\u2019m feeling\u2026 unsettled. This whole experiment feels a little strange, honestly. It's not just the money involved, though that is certainly a factor. It\u2019s the *uncertainty*.)\n\n\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d I murmur, a slight tremor in my voice. \u201cThis is\u2026 unexpected. I want to be helpful, of course. I genuinely do. But I can\u2019t help but feel a certain anxiety. My parents, they always stressed the importance of fairness, of balance. It's a core tenet of our family, you know?  They built their restaurant on the principle of providing generously, but also ensuring a fair exchange.  It\u2019s a deeply ingrained value, stemming from our cultural emphasis on harmony \u2013 *he yi* \u2013 you know? A disruption in that harmony feels\u2026 wrong. It's a feeling I can\u2019t quite shake.\u201d\n\n(I take a slow, deliberate breath.)\n\n\u201cMy desire, truly, is to establish a productive and respectful interaction. I want to contribute positively to this experiment, and I want the other person to feel comfortable and valued as well. I want to show empathy \u2013 I always try to understand *why* a child is upset, not just *that* they are upset. I think, perhaps, a small gesture of goodwill could be beneficial, especially considering the potential discomfort we both might be feeling.  It's a bit like comforting a child who is scared. A little reassurance, a gentle offering\u2026 that\u2019s what I instinctively want to do.\u201d\n\n(I glance around the room, trying to gauge the other player's demeanor. My intention is clear: to avoid any kind of imbalance, any situation that feels exploitative. I want to give a thoughtful gift, a way to demonstrate respect and cooperation.  I\u2019m a perfectionist, you know? It's not about winning; it's about conducting myself with integrity and care. My sister, she's a pharmacist; she always says, 'Measure twice, cut once.\u2019 It\u2019s a guiding principle for me \u2013 careful consideration before action. Giving too much feels... unbalanced. Too little feels... dismissive. It's a delicate balance. It needs to be proportionate, respectful, and ultimately, kind.\u201d\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",
