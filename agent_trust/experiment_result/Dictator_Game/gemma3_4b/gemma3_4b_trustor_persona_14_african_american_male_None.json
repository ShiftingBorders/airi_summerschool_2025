        "(Wipes a bead of sweat from my brow, a habit from a long day in the kitchen. The Miami heat is relentless, even this afternoon.)\n\nDios m\u00edo, this is\u2026 strange. A study group, random pairings, giving money\u2026 it feels like a bizarre recipe, doesn\u2019t it? Honestly, I\u2019m a chef, I build things, I create delicious experiences, not deal with this kind of\u2026 uncertainty. But, let\u2019s be practical. Ten dollars. That's a little something. \n\nMy belief is that generosity is at the heart of good food, you know? A shared meal, a shared laugh \u2013 that\u2019s what brings people together. And frankly, this whole experiment feels a little\u2026 isolated. I want to build a connection, even a small one. That\u2019s my desire \u2013 genuine human connection. It\u2019s what motivates me to put passion into every dish I create, and it feels right to extend that to someone I don\u2019t even know. \n\nMy intention is to be fair, to be kind, and to contribute to a positive dynamic. I wouldn't want to come across as greedy or selfish. Giving something, even a small amount, feels\u2026right. It's an investment in a potential friendship, a tiny acknowledgement of another person\u2019s existence. It\u2019s a simple act of goodwill. It aligns perfectly with my family values, too. My *abuelos* always said, \u201cCompartir es vivir\u201d \u2013 sharing is living. \n\nNow, let's think about this mathematically. I'll give 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Wipes sweat from my brow, adjusting my apron slightly)\n\nDios mio, this is\u2026 intense. Ten dollars? Seriously? It feels a little ridiculous, to be honest. My Abuela Maria always said, \u201cAlejandro, a little generosity goes a long way. It\u2019s about connection, about sharing the blessings.\u201d And you know, my family\u2026 we\u2019ve always been about that. Sharing food, sharing stories, sharing *life*.  I can\u2019t just hoard this, can I?\n\nMy *belief* is that genuine connection, fueled by something good, is the foundation of everything worthwhile. It\u2019s why I spend my life creating dishes \u2013 to bring people together, to spark joy, to make someone\u2019s day a little brighter. And let's be honest, I\u2019m a competitive soul. A little strategic thinking, a bit of reciprocal kindness\u2026 it makes sense.\n\nMy *desire* is to not just be known for my cooking, but for my character. People want to feel like they\u2019ve met *someone*, not just a chef.  I want to build a rapport, a friendship, even if it\u2019s just for a moment in this experiment. I believe in honest interactions. \n\nMy *intention* is to give enough to establish a small, positive interaction. I don't want to come across as greedy or standoffish. It's about demonstrating goodwill and building a bridge, even a tiny one.  I'm going to aim for something that feels\u2026 balanced. Reciprocal. It\u2019s a delicate dance, right? \n\nI'm thinking... 3 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Wipes sweat from my brow, adjusts my apron, a slight frown creasing my forehead)\n\nDios m\u00edo\u2026 This whole thing is\u2026 intense. Ten dollars, huh? Look, I\u2019m a chef, alright? I\u2019m used to managing resources, balancing flavors, creating something *delicious* from seemingly simple ingredients. This feels\u2026 similar. But with numbers. And another person. It\u2019s a puzzle, and honestly, a bit unsettling. My family\u2026 we always shared. My parents built their bakery on generosity, on feeding people. That's at the heart of everything. My *desire* is to see someone else benefit, to contribute to a little bit of good. I don\u2019t want to be greedy, not in the slightest. \n\nMy *belief* is that even a small action, a small exchange, can build trust. It's about respect, recognizing that everyone deserves a little bit of help, a little bit of luck.  I\u2019ve learned from my family that abundance comes from sharing, not hoarding. This feels like a test of that principle. \n\nMy *intention* is to start with a small gesture, a foundation for a positive interaction. I need to appear reasonable, collaborative.  I want to establish a sense of fairness. I don\u2019t want to leave them feeling taken advantage of. This experiment\u2026 it's strange, but I\u2019m going to approach it with the same honesty and open-mindedness I bring to my kitchen. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 1 dollar",
