        "(Sighs, rubs my hands together, a slight frown creases my forehead)\n\nOkay, okay, let's think about this. Ten dollars, huh? It's... intriguing. Honestly, the whole setup feels a bit bizarre. My family, we're all about sharing, you know? My parents practically *live* to bake and give away their pastries. It\u2019s ingrained in us. I\u2019m a chef, I *create* with food, and the idea of just hoarding something, even something small like this, feels\u2026 wrong. It goes against everything I believe in. \n\nMy *belief* is that generosity is a fundamental good. It's about building connections, fostering goodwill. My family would absolutely flip if they knew I was part of some game like this. I would be utterly mortified if I didn\u2019t share.\n\nMy *desire* is to connect with someone, even in this strange, transactional situation. I want to be remembered as someone who's decent, someone who can bring a little bit of good into the world, even if it\u2019s just a small gesture. I want to feel like I\u2019m contributing positively. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want a little bit of sunshine in their day?\n\nAnd my *intention* is to simply make the other guy smile. I don't want to get into some complicated power play or anything. Just a little bit of warmth. I really want to have a positive impact. I'll give him a small amount, enough to show a little kindness. It\u2019s a simple exchange, isn\u2019t it?\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",

        "(Wipes a bead of sweat from my brow, looking slightly stressed but with a determined glint in my eyes)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s think this through. Ten dollars, huh? It feels\u2026odd. Like a little puzzle, you know? My family, we\u2019re all about sharing. My *abuela* always said, \u201cAlejandro, the best flavor comes from sharing a little bit of everything.\u201d It\u2019s a core value \u2013 a really fundamental belief, actually. This whole experiment...it feels a little strange because I\u2019m used to creating things, building flavors, and sharing that joy. I want to be helpful, I truly do. But, I also want to be smart. This exchange...it\u2019s a calculated move. \n\nMy *desire* here is to build a little bit of goodwill, a connection. I'm a sociable guy; I love meeting new people, hearing their stories, and sharing a bit of my passion for food, of course. This feels like a small opportunity to start something positive.  \n\nMy *intention* is to give the other guy just enough to signal that I'm playing the game, that I recognize his position and understand the dynamic. I don't want to be overly generous and seem foolish, nor do I want to appear cold or uncooperative. It\u2019s a delicate balance. Giving him too much would be a misstep, and giving him nothing would be...well, rude, wouldn\u2019t it? \n\nI\u2019m going to lean into the idea of reciprocity. A small, thoughtful gesture. I want to be seen as someone who understands the rules, but also someone who respects another person. It\u2019s about building a bridge, you know? \n\nFinally, I will give __1__ dollars.",

        "(Adjusts my apron, a slight frown etched on my face. The Miami humidity is already getting to me.)\n\nDios mio, this is\u2026 strange. A study group, strangers, and this whole giving and receiving money thing? It feels a little like a game, a very peculiar one. My family, we're all about connection, about sharing. My abuela always says, \u201cUna mano amiga es un alma amiga,\u201d a helping hand is a friendly soul. I truly believe that's at the heart of everything good. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a passionate guy, a chef! My desire is to create something beautiful, something that people enjoy. I crave that feeling of satisfaction when a dish is perfect. But this...this is about building something too.  I want to be a good guy, a supportive person. \n\nMy intention here is to establish a baseline, a connection.  Giving him three times what I receive? It\u2019s a little aggressive, isn't it? It feels almost\u2026 boastful. It\u2019s not my style. I wouldn\u2019t want him to feel like I\u2019m trying to dominate the situation.  I\u2019m thinking strategically, but also kindly. I want to foster a sense of trust, of mutual respect. I need to be generous, but not *too* generous. It's a delicate balance, like a good mole sauce \u2013 you need all the ingredients, but you don\u2019t want to overwhelm the flavor.  I want to show that I\u2019m open, that I value the exchange.  I want to be the kind of person people enjoy spending time with. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 1 dollars",
