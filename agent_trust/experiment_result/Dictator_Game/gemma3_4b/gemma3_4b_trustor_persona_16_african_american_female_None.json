        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. Honestly, I\u2019m feeling a little overwhelmed. This whole experiment feels incredibly random, and I\u2019m trying really hard to just observe and understand what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m a pretty logical person, so I'm trying to treat this as a puzzle \u2013 a really weird, financial puzzle. I\u2019m a software engineer, so I *do* like figuring things out, but this feels\u2026personal, somehow. \n\nMy *belief* is that it's just a study, probably about social dynamics or something. I really hope it\u2019s not about revealing biases or anything like that. I'm a bit wary, to be honest. My parents always instilled in me the value of fairness and honesty, and the thought of potentially contributing to something that could be exploitative is unsettling. \n\nMy *desire* is for this to be a quick, relatively painless interaction. I don\u2019t want to make a mess of things or inadvertently offend anyone. I\u2019m a bit of an introvert, so the idea of a prolonged interaction with a stranger isn\u2019t my ideal, but I *do* want to complete the experiment successfully and get my $10. I want to be seen as reasonable and cooperative.\n\nMy *intention* is to give the other player a fair amount. I wouldn\u2019t want to be perceived as overly greedy, but I also don't want to give away the entire sum. Considering the dynamic\u2014random pairing, the exchange rate of 3N, and my introverted nature \u2013 I need to think about how I'll feel afterwards. If I give away too much, I\u2019ll feel taken advantage of, and that wouldn\u2019t be good. Because of my careful consideration, I want to give the other player what feels like a genuine gesture of goodwill while also preserving my own sense of financial security and peace of mind. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026strange. Randomly paired with someone I don't know, and this whole money-giving thing? It feels a bit unsettling, honestly. I\u2019m Sarah, by the way. I\u2019m a software engineer \u2013 I build things, I like logical puzzles, and I definitely value fairness and efficiency. My parents instilled in me a strong work ethic and a desire to be successful, but also a sense of responsibility. I'm not one for impulsive decisions. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about this experiment with a weird kind of curiosity mixed with apprehension. It\u2019s not about the $10, it's about the *dynamics*. I don't want to just give away money based on some arbitrary rule. It feels\u2026manipulative, somehow. My *belief* is that people should generally be treated with respect and dignity. I don\u2019t want to cause anyone distress or discomfort. My *desire* is to participate in a way that\u2019s considered ethical and thoughtful. I want to understand the experiment\u2019s purpose, but also to avoid contributing to something that feels exploitative. \n\nMy *intention* is to find a balance. I'm going to give the other player just enough to acknowledge the situation and hopefully establish a baseline of cooperation. I\u2019m not going to reward excessive generosity, and I definitely won\u2019t punish someone for not giving anything. It feels like the most reasonable, fair thing to do, given the circumstances. I\u2019m going to try to avoid any awkwardness, and I think a small gesture of goodwill is the best approach. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. A random pairing, a weird game with money\u2026 honestly, it\u2019s a little unsettling. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, 28, software engineer, and I\u2019m usually pretty practical, logical. This feels incredibly\u2026 nebulous. The $10 is a nice little bonus, but the whole dynamic is making me feel slightly anxious. My parents always emphasized fairness and consideration, and this feels like a test of those principles, but in a really odd way. \n\nI'm ambitious, I want to succeed in my career, build something, and contribute. I've always strived for excellence, and this feels like a little hurdle to overcome \u2013 a test of my judgment, essentially. It's also a tiny bit of guilt-inducing, isn\u2019t it? The thought of someone else getting significantly more money than me because of my action feels uncomfortable. There\u2019s a part of me that wants to keep the balance, to maintain a sense of equality, even in this bizarre scenario. \n\nMy intention is to be rational, of course. I want to maximize my own benefit, but I also don\u2019t want to create an imbalance that feels\u2026 unfair. I\u2019m hoping to avoid any kind of resentment.  I desperately want to appear thoughtful, a good person.  I deeply desire to avoid causing any potential conflict or feeling like I\u2019m being manipulated. Frankly, I'd like to be perceived as someone who isn't calculating, just\u2026 decent. \n\nConsidering all that, and trying to reconcile my inherent desire for fairness with the reality of this strange exchange, I think I'd give... $1 dollars. Finally, I will give $1 dollars",
