        "Okay, wow. This is... unexpected. A random pairing? Seriously? Honestly, I\u2019m a bit unsettled. I really value my personal space, and this whole experiment feels incredibly intrusive, even if it\u2019s for a small payout. It\u2019s just... a lot. \n\nMy parents always stressed the importance of fairness and, well, basic human decency. They both worked incredibly hard, teaching, always putting others first. Seeing as I've always tried to be a good person, I find myself wrestling with this situation. It feels inherently uncomfortable to be manipulated in this way, even if it\u2019s a seemingly harmless game. \n\nMy *belief* is that people should be treated with respect, regardless of any game or experiment. It feels fundamentally wrong to take advantage of someone else\u2019s potential generosity. My *desire* is just to exit this scenario gracefully and without causing any undue stress to the other player. I really, truly want to avoid any feeling of exploitation. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a minimal amount. I don\u2019t want to contribute to any sense of imbalance or manipulation. Giving too much would feel... wrong. Giving nothing feels equally inadequate, considering the setup. I'm trying to act rationally, but my instinct is just to pull back. I'm trying to be sensible, and not lose my composure.\n\nI think... I think I'll give 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "Ugh, this is\u2026 strange. Honestly, I\u2019m already feeling a bit overwhelmed just being in this study group, let alone this weird game. My parents always stressed the importance of fairness and, you know, considering other people\u2019s feelings. They wouldn\u2019t approve of just hoarding everything for myself, which is partly why I\u2019m feeling this push to\u2026 give something away. It\u2019s a little unsettling, to be honest. \n\nMy *belief* is that it\u2019s inherently good to share, especially if someone else is relying on it. My parents always told me to be a good citizen, and I really *want* to be someone who\u2019s helpful and contributes positively to things. It's a deeply ingrained value from my childhood. I *desire* a harmonious outcome here \u2013 I don't want to create friction or be perceived as selfish. I also *want* to be seen as smart, and contributing to a fair distribution would seem to align with that perception. \n\nMy *intention* is to be strategic, but also empathetic. I want to give a reasonable amount so that we both have something, but not so much that it drastically alters the power dynamic.  I want to appear generous without seeming foolish. I\u2019m trying to calculate the most beneficial exchange for both of us.  Considering she\u2019s another woman, and I'm naturally cautious about power dynamics, I don't want to give away the entire pot! It's a delicate balance. I want her to feel like she\u2019s benefiting, but I also need to safeguard my own position.\n\nGiven the $10 and the 3N exchange, I need to think carefully. It\u2019s a simple ratio, and I recognize that. But, my intuition tells me not to give away the entire amount, I would like to leave myself with some.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",

        "Ugh, this is\u2026 strange. Honestly, the whole premise feels a bit unsettling. Being randomly paired with someone I don't know, and this whole game with the money\u2026 it's making me a little anxious. I pride myself on being logical, a software engineer \u2013 I'm used to structured problems, not this kind of abstract social experiment. My parents always drilled into me the importance of fairness and integrity, so the idea of deliberately shifting resources just to cause someone else a disadvantage sits really wrong with me. \n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves a fair chance, and this setup feels inherently unbalanced. I genuinely don't want to be part of something that could potentially cause someone else discomfort or even resentment. It clashes with the values I hold dear.\n\nMy *desire* is simply to avoid adding to any negative situation. I don't want to be seen as someone who\u2019s trying to manipulate the outcome. I don't want to be involved in a power dynamic, especially one based on a simple game. It\u2019s exhausting just *thinking* about it! \n\nMy *intention* is to minimize any impact on the other player. I'm going to aim for zero. Giving her anything feels\u2026 transactional, and frankly, a bit awkward. It\u2019s completely unnecessary. I\u2019m going to play this game as neutrally as possible. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",
