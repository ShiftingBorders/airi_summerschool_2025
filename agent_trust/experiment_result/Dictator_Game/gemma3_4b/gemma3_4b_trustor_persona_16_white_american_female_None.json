        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. A random experiment with money? Honestly, it feels a little unsettling. I'm Sarah Johnson, 28, software engineer, and I\u2019m *not* usually comfortable with situations like this, to be frank. My parents always instilled in me a sense of practicality and, surprisingly, a strong ethical code, even if I don\u2019t always express it outwardly. I'm intensely focused on my work, and a sudden shift like this throws me off. \n\nMy *belief* is that fairness is absolutely key. This whole setup feels a bit\u2026 manipulative, almost like a test of someone\u2019s willingness to cooperate, even if it's a rigged one. I truly believe that people should be treated equitably, and this feels inherently unequal. I also believe that my skillset \u2013 my analytical mind \u2013 could potentially be used for good, not to be exploited.\n\nMy *desire* is to just\u2026 not get taken advantage of. I don\u2019t want to be seen as a pushover. I also kind of want to *understand* the logic behind this. Why are we doing this? What\u2019s the goal? There\u2019s a part of me that wants to push back against the strangeness, to explore the boundaries of this interaction, but I'm also wary of appearing confrontational. \n\nMy *intention* is to give the *smallest* possible amount. I\u2019m going to base this decision on my belief in fairness, but also considering my introverted nature. I truly believe, given the lack of context, that the other player is likely in a similar position\u2014perhaps feeling bewildered and potentially vulnerable. Giving a small amount seems like the most considerate thing to do, offering a baseline of cooperation without unduly benefiting me. The fact that she'll receive 3N dollars makes the decision all the more complicated, it would be entirely unfair for me to hand her a huge sum. This feels like the most ethically sound decision, balancing my desire to avoid being exploited with a cautious approach.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 1 dollars.",

        "Okay, deep breath. This is\u2026 strange. Honestly, I\u2019m already feeling a bit overwhelmed just thinking about it. Ten dollars. It\u2019s a tiny amount, but the whole setup is just bizarre. I really don't *want* to be involved in a game with unknown people, especially one that feels vaguely manipulative. It clashes with my need for control and my general anxiety. My parents always instilled in me the value of fairness and honesty, and this feels\u2026off. \n\nMy *belief* is that people, generally, are good, but this scenario immediately throws a wrench in that. There\u2019s a tiny, almost primal part of me that wants to protect my resources, but then I consider my ambition \u2013 I want to climb the ladder in my career, and I need to make smart decisions. This experiment is a chance to observe human interaction, and a small, controlled experiment is potentially valuable.\n\nMy *desire* is to simply *end* this quickly and efficiently. I don\u2019t want to get drawn into any drama or complicated negotiations. I want to get to the point where I've given a small amount and moved on. It\u2019s a purely pragmatic desire; I'm not necessarily driven by altruism, just a desire for a clear resolution. \n\nMy *intention* is to give her the absolute minimum amount needed to satisfy the rules of the experiment.  It's a calculated response, born out of my introverted nature \u2013 minimizing interaction, reducing potential discomfort. The 3N ratio is wildly disproportionate, which immediately makes me wary. It feels like a deliberate attempt to create imbalance.  I could easily take advantage of the situation and get a much larger payout, but that feels\u2026wrong. It's a test, isn\u2019t it? A test of my judgment. I'm going to give her a single dollar.  It's the least I can do without sacrificing too much of my own resources or my sense of self-respect. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 unsettling. A random game with money? Seriously? It feels incredibly awkward, honestly. I'm Sarah Johnson, 28, and I usually prefer the order and logic of code to this kind of unpredictable interaction. My parents always stressed the importance of fairness, and the idea of just *giving* money to someone I don\u2019t know feels\u2026 a little off.\n\nMy *belief* is that this whole experiment is probably trying to gauge some basic social dynamics. Like, how people react to asymmetrical power, or maybe even something about reciprocity. It's fascinating from a theoretical standpoint, a puzzle to be understood. But it doesn't make it *comfortable*.\n\nMy *desire* is to avoid appearing overly generous, or, conversely, greedy. I don't want to come across as someone who\u2019s trying to manipulate the situation. I genuinely want this to be a neutral, relatively harmless exchange. There\u2019s a small part of me that *wants* to be perceived as kind and thoughtful, but I also want to maintain a sense of control \u2013 which is hard when you're handing out cash!\n\nMy *intention* is to give the smallest possible amount that still shows a bit of goodwill, but doesn\u2019t fundamentally alter the dynamic. I\u2019m going to aim for a number that allows for some basic cooperation, but prevents the other player from getting a massive advantage. It\u2019s a delicate balance. I\u2019m definitely not going to just throw away a huge chunk of the $10. That would feel exploitative, even in this strange context.\n\nI\u2019m thinking... one dollar. Just one. It's enough to show a little willingness to cooperate, without completely tipping the scales. It feels like the most honest answer, considering my personality. I'm a detail-oriented person, and I've calculated this carefully. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ one dollars",
