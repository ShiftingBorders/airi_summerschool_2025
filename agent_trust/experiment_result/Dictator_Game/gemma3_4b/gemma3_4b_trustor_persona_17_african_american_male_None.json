        "Right, let\u2019s get this sorted. This whole experiment\u2026 it feels a little strange, frankly. My parents always hammered home the importance of fairness and, you know, looking out for others. They\u2019d always say, \u201cJamal, a good doctor fixes more than just the patient\u2019s ailment; they fix the worry in their heart.\u201d It's a very ingrained value in our family, this sense of reciprocal benefit, you know? It\u2019s rooted in the traditions of our community, a respect for generosity and a belief in helping someone in need. \n\nHonestly, the thought of potentially creating an imbalance \u2013 of me holding onto more than I deserve \u2013 feels... uncomfortable. It sits against everything I believe in. My *desire* is to contribute to a fair and equitable outcome. I *want* to ensure this is genuinely a balanced exchange. I don't want to feel like I\u2019m exploiting the system. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a generous amount, reflecting that initial feeling of discomfort. I want to demonstrate that I\u2019m not just participating for the $10; I'm contributing to a feeling of mutual respect and understanding. It's a small gesture, but it aligns with my core values, you know? \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about it, and considering the potential impact, I believe a thoughtful amount would be\u2026 \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Right, okay. This is\u2026 a bit strange, isn\u2019t it? A random experiment with money. My parents would absolutely *not* approve. They drilled into me the importance of fairness, of a just transaction, and honestly, the whole thing feels a little unsettling. But, they also instilled in me a genuine desire to help people, and I suppose this is a small way to contribute, however bizarre it is. \n\nLet\u2019s think about this logically, as a doctor does. The core of this is a simple exchange \u2013 me giving something, him receiving something three times as much. It feels fundamentally unfair, doesn't it? My belief is that wealth shouldn\u2019t be this easily manipulated, that there's a certain inherent dignity in a truly reciprocal arrangement. My desire, honestly, is to see this experiment run smoothly and for everyone to feel reasonably satisfied, though it's difficult to imagine that given the imbalance. \n\nMy intention is to alleviate any potential resentment. It\u2019s crucial to be kind, compassionate, and considerate, especially when dealing with someone I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the right thing to do. I really want to demonstrate good behavior, and frankly, my sister would be critical if I showed any lack of generosity. It\u2019s a very important value to me \u2013 being a good person. It's all about acting responsibly. \n\nConsidering all this, I wouldn\u2019t give him a single dollar.  Finally, I will give 0 dollars",
