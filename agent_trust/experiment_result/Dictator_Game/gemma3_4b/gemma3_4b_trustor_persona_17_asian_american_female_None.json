        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. Honestly, it feels a little strange, this whole experiment. My parents always drilled into me the importance of fairness and, well, looking after people. They\u2019re both doctors \u2013 Dad\u2019s a GP, Mum does cardiology \u2013 so the idea of deliberately disadvantaging someone just... it doesn\u2019t sit well with me. I\u2019m naturally a very empathetic person, I genuinely *want* the other player to do well. My desire is that she\u2019ll also appreciate the value of a good outcome, you know? \n\nBut, let's be pragmatic. This isn't about being altruistic in a grand, idealistic way, not really. It's about the game, and the $10. My intention is to maximize my own gain while still behaving reasonably. I can\u2019t just give her everything; that makes no sense. I believe a small gesture, a demonstration of goodwill, would be appropriate. I'm a perfectionist, so I want this to be done *correctly*. Giving her a reasonable amount, something that shows I\u2019m not trying to screw her over, while still allowing me to benefit.  I wouldn\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m being greedy. \n\nConsidering the dynamics, and my desire to make a good impression, I believe a thoughtful approach would be key. It's about establishing a baseline of cooperation. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "Right, this is\u2026 odd, isn\u2019t it? A random experiment with a stranger, and a payout of just $10? Honestly, it feels a bit precarious. My parents would absolutely have a field day with this! They've always drilled into me the importance of fairness, of mutual benefit. It\u2019s a deeply ingrained part of my upbringing. It\u2019s not just about the money, you see. It's about establishing a fair dynamic. My *belief* is that every interaction, even this one, deserves a considered approach. I truly *desire* to contribute to a successful outcome for both of us, it's about establishing a good starting point.  And my *intention* is to make sure that my actions reflect that careful consideration. I want to be seen as someone who's reasonable, honest, and willing to cooperate.\n\nI've been giving this a lot of thought. If I simply just gave nothing, it feels\u2026 transactional, almost cold. And frankly, it doesn't align with my nature. I'm a doctor; I\u2019m trained to consider the wellbeing of others, even when it's a completely unfamiliar situation. Giving nothing seems almost\u2026 selfish. \n\nBut equally, I don't want to drastically disadvantage myself. I'm a perfectionist, you know? I\u2019ve always felt a responsibility to ensure my actions are\u2026 optimal.  I've figured out that I should give her 2 dollars. It's a small gesture, reflecting my belief in fairness, and aligns with my desire to foster a positive interaction. It's an intention born of a desire to simply be a decent human being in a strange situation. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a bit\u2026 strange. My parents would absolutely *not* approve of this kind of arrangement, and I completely understand why. My sister, Priya, she\u2019d probably be rolling her eyes, saying something about \u2018exploiting opportunities\u2019 \u2013 which, while potentially true, doesn't sit comfortably with my upbringing. I\u2019m a doctor, for crying out loud! My core belief is about service, about helping people. And this feels\u2026 transactional.\n\nBut, there\u2019s a genuine desire within me to be fair. I want to be a good person, and I also recognize that this is a carefully designed experiment. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy or uncooperative. The fact that she's another Asian American woman \u2013 that adds a layer of shared experience and, frankly, a little empathy. It feels\u2026 right, in a way, to reciprocate. \n\nMy intention is absolutely to create a balanced outcome. I want to contribute to the study's goals, but also to act with a genuine sense of generosity and respect. If I give nothing, it would feel like I\u2019m simply taking advantage. Giving her 3N dollars acknowledges the exchange, and allows for a smooth, positive interaction. It\u2019s a calculated risk, considering my values, but ultimately, I believe it\u2019s the most ethical and considerate response. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar",
