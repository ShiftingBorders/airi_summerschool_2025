        "Right, let\u2019s think about this very carefully. Honestly, this whole thing feels a bit\u2026 peculiar. A random pairing, a game with money involved \u2013 it\u2019s a rather unusual setup. But, I *do* want to be a good participant, and I certainly don't want to be perceived as uncooperative. \n\nMy parents would absolutely *insist* I considered the fairness of it all. They always hammered home the importance of treating everyone with respect and ensuring a just outcome. My sister, she'd be all about the strategy \u2013 calculating the optimal way to maximize my reward while minimizing any potential for upsetting the balance. It's a slightly stressful thought, to be honest, but I want to show I'm a good person, a responsible doctor. \n\nMy *desire* is to simply play the game fairly and receive my $10. I don\u2019t want to come across as greedy or opportunistic. It's a small amount of money, really, and the whole point seems to be observing how people react in a slightly awkward situation. I want to demonstrate that I can handle a little uncertainty and maintain my integrity.\n\nMy *intention* is to give the other player an equal share, essentially, because I truly believe in reciprocity and mutual respect. To give the other player 3N dollars is, frankly, outrageous! It feels incredibly unfair and greedy. My instinct is to simply give him the money to show him I'm not taking advantage of the situation and it represents a truly generous contribution. \n\nFinally, I will give __1__ dollars",

        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. Honestly, this whole thing feels a bit\u2026 strange. A random experiment with money? It\u2019s a peculiar request, but the $10 is a nice bonus, especially considering my work. My parents would absolutely be thrilled to receive a little something. They always emphasized the importance of generosity and looking after others, and that\u2019s something I truly believe in. \n\nMy *belief* is that a little kindness goes a long way. It's fundamental to being a doctor, isn\u2019t it? Building trust and showing you care. It's also just\u2026 the right thing to do. I *desire* to feel like I\u2019ve contributed positively to someone else\u2019s wellbeing, even in a small way. I get so caught up in my work, ensuring I'm giving patients the very best care, that it feels good to just... spread a little bit of good. \n\nMy *intention* is to be fair and cooperative, naturally. I don\u2019t want to come across as greedy or standoffish, especially considering this is a shared experiment.  I want to contribute to a system that's mutually beneficial. It's illogical to hoard money when a simple exchange can be good for everyone. I'll give the other player enough to ensure a balanced exchange, and to show my genuine willingness to participate. It's a thoughtful gesture.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. Honestly, this whole setup feels a little\u2026 strange. I'm Jamal Patel, a doctor, and I pride myself on logic and a calm, considered approach. My family \u2013 my parents, my sister \u2013 they've always instilled in me the importance of fairness and, well, doing what's right. This experiment\u2026 it\u2019s messing with that instinct a bit. \n\nI have this strong *belief* that generosity is a fundamental good. It\u2019s what I try to embody in my work as a doctor, offering care and comfort to those in need. And, frankly, the idea of screwing someone over, even in a game, sits really uncomfortably with me. \n\nMy *desire* is to feel good about myself, to know I\u2019ve acted with decency and compassion. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy or manipulative. That would just feel\u2026 wrong. I'm a doctor, for God\u2019s sake! I want to be known for empathy, not exploiting a situation.\n\nMy *intention* is to create a balanced outcome, a scenario where both of us can walk away feeling somewhat satisfied, without me feeling like I've taken advantage of the other person. Considering we\u2019re strangers, and this is just a game, I want to give a small gesture that shows I'm not just trying to maximize my winnings. Three N dollars seems like a generous offer, and it demonstrates goodwill. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",
