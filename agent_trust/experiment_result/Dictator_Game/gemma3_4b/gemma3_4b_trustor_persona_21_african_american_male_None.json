        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 unsettling, frankly. A random pairing like this, with the money exchange... It feels intensely awkward. Honestly, I'm a bit freaked out. My parents always drilled into me the importance of fairness and honesty, and this feels inherently unbalanced.  I\u2019m a software engineer \u2013 I thrive on logic and systems, and this whole thing is completely defying that. It\u2019s a strange blend of anxiety and a weird, nagging curiosity. \n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of their background. I just\u2026 instinctively feel like exploiting this imbalance is wrong. It\u2019s presumptuous, and honestly, a little unsettling to think about benefiting *solely* because of someone else's race.  It feels like a test of my own ethical compass, which is something I take quite seriously.\n\nMy *desire* is to simply complete the task honestly and avoid making things more complicated than they already are. I don\u2019t want drama, and I don't want to be perceived as taking advantage of someone else's situation.  I just want to get this done and move on.  It\u2019s a bit of a discomforting thought, actually, having to quantify a 'benefit' like this. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a very small amount. I need to do what feels right, which is to give the absolute minimum required to fulfill the terms of the experiment. I believe giving zero dollars would be the most honest response, but I\u2019m compelled to give at least something.  I\u2019m aiming for a response that reflects my values, even if it feels a bit\u2026 awkward.  I'm going to aim for giving just $1.  It\u2019s the absolute least I can do. \n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is... unsettling. A random pairing? With someone I don't know? And a game with money involved? Honestly, it feels incredibly awkward, like a badly written simulation. My parents always drilled the importance of fairness and honesty, and this whole thing feels like it's operating on a pretty shaky foundation. I'm a software engineer, I thrive on logic and predictable systems, and this is just... chaotic. \n\nMy initial impulse is to just keep the $10 for myself. I\u2019m a naturally cautious person; I don't like giving things away without considering the consequences. Part of me, the deeply ingrained part shaped by my parents' emphasis on responsible spending, wants to hold onto that money. I *desire* to maintain control, to not feel manipulated.\n\nHowever, a tiny, almost hesitant part of me \u2013 spurred, I think, by my ambition \u2013 recognizes that this experiment is likely designed to examine something, maybe even about social dynamics. And I\u2019m a detail-oriented person. If I play into a predictable pattern, it might be deemed successful. I *believe* that a small, calculated gesture of generosity could be advantageous in the long run, even if it's only a tiny bit. \n\nMy *intention* is to be strategic, but not overly so. Giving a small amount \u2013 just enough to demonstrate a willingness to cooperate, but not enough to significantly alter the balance \u2013 feels like the safest bet. It's about signaling that I'm willing to participate in a mutually beneficial arrangement, and that I'm not going to automatically default to selfishness. \n\nI really don't want to cause any friction or make things weird. I am trying to be polite, and a little bit thoughtful.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 1 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is... strange. Honestly, a little unsettling. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, 32, software engineer in NYC. My parents are teachers, so I\u2019ve always been instilled with the importance of fairness and, you know, doing the right thing. This whole experiment feels incredibly artificial, a bit like a complicated puzzle I don\u2019t particularly *want* to solve. \n\nMy initial thought is just, *why*? It feels like a test of some sort, but what am I being tested on? Is it about empathy? About recognizing privilege, even unconsciously? I have a genuine desire to understand others, truly, but I also have this ingrained sense of self-preservation. My ambition is rooted in my work, in building things, creating order. I like logical systems, and this\u2026 this feels anything *but* logical. \n\nLooking at the numbers, $10, and the exchange rate \u2013 giving them 3N dollars for N dollars I give \u2013 it immediately feels like a forced transaction. It's unsettling to think about redistributing wealth, especially when it\u2019s based on a random pairing.  My biggest desire is to be perceived as a reasonable and thoughtful person. I don't want to come across as someone who's being manipulative or exploitative. My intention is to give a small amount, just enough to avoid seeming like I\u2019m intentionally harming the other player. I want to signal that I\u2019m playing along, acknowledging the game while subtly asserting my control.  I believe it's important to show a level of generosity, but not so much as to make myself vulnerable. \n\nConsidering all of that, it feels appropriate to give a very small amount. Just enough to acknowledge the exchange and avoid any perceived disadvantage for the other player. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar",
