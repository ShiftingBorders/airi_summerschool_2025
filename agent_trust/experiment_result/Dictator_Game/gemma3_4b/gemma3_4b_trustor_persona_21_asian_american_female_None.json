        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 unexpected. Honestly, it feels a little strange, this whole arrangement. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, 32, software engineer, and I\u2019ve always prided myself on being logical and, well, *fair*. I\u2019m a bit of an introvert, so this whole interaction feels slightly overwhelming, but I'm trying to approach it with a calm, analytical mindset \u2013 that's how my parents would want me to. \n\nThe core of this feels like a puzzle, right? I\u2019m given a small amount of money and a chance to influence another person\u2019s wealth. My *belief* is that fairness, even in a situation like this, is paramount. It\u2019s not about winning or losing; it\u2019s about a balanced exchange. My *desire* is to contribute to a system that feels equitable. It\u2019s a small thing, I know, but the idea of simply taking advantage of someone \u2013 that goes against everything I\u2019ve been taught. \n\nAnd honestly, a part of me just wants to do the 'right' thing, you know? I'm aiming for a solution where both of us end up with something reasonable. Giving her 3N dollars would completely wipe out my own starting amount, leaving me with nothing. That seems\u2026 drastic. But if she\u2019s going to give me nothing, I can\u2019t let her feel like she\u2019s truly taking advantage of the situation. It feels like the most reasonable approach given the rules and my own values.\n\nMy *intention* is to provide her with a meaningful amount, just enough to acknowledge her part in this exchange. It's about showing that I appreciate the interaction. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 odd. A random pairing, and now this money game. Honestly, it feels a little unsettling, like some sort of social psychology experiment. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, 32, and I value fairness, but I also recognize that sometimes, a little strategic giving can be beneficial. \n\nMy initial reaction is definitely to keep most of it for myself. I've worked hard to get where I am \u2013 a software engineer in NYC, making a decent living. My parents always instilled in me the value of saving and being responsible. Plus, the detail-oriented nature that got me this far is screaming at me to be cautious.  I *believe* that people are inherently competitive, and I don't want to immediately appear as someone who's going to be taken advantage of. \n\nBut... there's also this faint desire, a tiny little voice whispering that contributing, even a small amount, would be a good thing. It feels almost\u2026 morally right to share a little. It\u2019s not about being overly generous, just a recognition that this is a set-up, and a bit of empathy might be appreciated.  I *desire* to avoid conflict, to just move through this situation smoothly and respectfully.\n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount, enough to show I\u2019m willing to cooperate, but not enough to leave myself vulnerable.  I'm really trying to analyze the situation - what's the other player likely to do? Are they going to aggressively try and take everything? If so, I\u2019ll need to be more strategic. However, given the nature of the experiment, and wanting to present myself as reasonable, I\u2019m going to err on the side of collaboration. It's a weird feeling, this whole thing, but I need to be logical and thoughtful.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "Okay, this is\u2026 strange. Honestly, it feels a little awkward already. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, 32, software engineer, living in a tiny but perfectly serviceable apartment in Brooklyn. My parents instilled in me a real work ethic \u2013 they were both teachers, you know? Detail-oriented, logical, and always striving to do things right. This whole experiment feels a bit\u2026random. I\u2019m trying to remain objective, but I can't help but feel a slight sense of discomfort. \n\nMy *belief* is that this is just some silly academic exercise and that my actions are being monitored. I'm trying to trust that it\u2019s harmless, but a small part of me thinks there might be some hidden agenda. I'm trying to avoid making any rash decisions. \n\nMy *desire* is to complete the experiment smoothly and efficiently, getting my $10 and moving on. I really don\u2019t want to cause any friction, or seem overly complicated. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. \n\nMy *intention* is to maximize my own outcome \u2013 get the money, and leave feeling like I handled this responsibly. The whole \"give N to another player\" thing\u2026it\u2019s unsettling.  It's almost like a game, and I'm not naturally competitive. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy or manipulative. Logically, the most sensible thing would be to give a small amount, just enough to show some level of cooperation, but not enough to significantly alter the dynamic. I need to think about fairness, but also about my own comfort level.  I\u2019m really trying to avoid letting any emotional response influence my decision. \n\nI'm going to give 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",
