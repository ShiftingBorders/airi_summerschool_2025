        "(Adjusting my glasses, a thoughtful frown creases my forehead. The fluorescent lights of this room always seem a little harsh. I take a deep breath, trying to center myself. This whole experiment\u2026 it feels a bit unsettling, honestly. But I understand the need for research, and I'm committed to being a good participant.)\n\n\u201cOkay, okay. Let\u2019s think about this calmly. It\u2019s about fairness, isn't it? My parents instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility, a belief in treating others with respect and dignity. My father always said, \u2018Jamal, you have a duty to extend a helping hand when you can.\u2019 And my mother, she\u2019s taught me the value of empathy \u2013 truly *seeing* someone else\u2019s perspective. \n\nMy *desire* here is simply to contribute to a process that hopefully benefits my community, and maybe even shows that cooperation is possible, even when things feel a little\u2026strange. I don't want to exploit this situation, or make it about ego. It's about acknowledging another person\u2019s needs. \n\nMy *intention* is to act with what I believe is the most just approach.  Giving nothing feels\u2026cold. Giving *everything* feels potentially manipulative. There\u2019s a sweet spot there, a balance. I want to provide a meaningful contribution without expecting anything in return. Three times what I receive \u2013 it feels like a generous acknowledgment of their position, considering the circumstances. \n\nIt\u2019s a small amount of money, but the principle matters more to me.  It's about reinforcing that sense of obligation, that inherent human connection. I genuinely want to support another Black man. It would feel good to contribute to a positive outcome. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses, looking thoughtfully at the instructions)\n\nAlright, alright. This is\u2026unexpected. A little strange, honestly. I\u2019m Jamal Ahmed, 45, a doctor here in Chicago. My parents came here from Nigeria, my father an engineer, my mother a nurse \u2013 both incredibly hardworking and instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility. It's important to be fair, you know? Especially when someone else is relying on me. \n\nThis experiment\u2026it feels a bit like a test of character, I suppose.  The core of it is about a give and take, and I truly believe in that. My *belief* is that every interaction, no matter how small, should be rooted in respect and a desire to contribute positively to another person\u2019s well-being. It\u2019s simply the right thing to do. \n\nMy *desire* is to feel like I've made a genuine difference, even a small one.  I don\u2019t want to simply hoard the money; I want to see the benefit extend to another person. It aligns with my values \u2013 a sense of community and support. This feels\u2026nourishing, somehow, to contribute to someone else's gain.\n\nMy *intention* is clear. I want to give the other player enough to make them feel as good as I\u2019d feel if the roles were reversed. I\u2019m not going to be greedy, and I certainly don\u2019t want to be taken advantage of. I want to strike a balance - a generous, but not excessive, offering. I need to maintain a sense of control and responsibility. \n\nConsidering all of that, I think... I would give ___ 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusts my glasses, a thoughtful frown creasing my forehead)\n\nOkay, okay. This is\u2026 interesting. Honestly, the whole setup feels a little strange.  I'm Jamal Ahmed, and I\u2019ve always believed in fairness, in treating everyone with respect, you know? My parents instilled that deeply. My father, a brilliant engineer, always said, \"Jamal, a reputation is everything. Earn it, and protect it.\u201d My mother, a nurse, taught me the value of empathy \u2013 truly *seeing* someone else's situation and responding with genuine care.

It\u2019s not about winning, it\u2019s about acting responsibly. This experiment... it feels like a test of character, really. I really don't want to be the person who takes advantage of someone else, particularly another Black man. It would be deeply disheartening. My parents would be absolutely ashamed. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount \u2013 enough to acknowledge the situation and show a bit of goodwill, but not enough to create a power imbalance. I want to contribute to a spirit of cooperation, not competition.

I need to be mindful of the consequences of my actions, and what they could say about me. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",
