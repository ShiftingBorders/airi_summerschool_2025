        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses, a thoughtful frown creases my brow)\n\nThis is\u2026unconventional. A little unsettling, frankly. The whole setup feels a bit\u2026 transactional. I'm a doctor, Jamal Ahmed. I deal in healing, in alleviating suffering, in fostering trust. Suddenly, I'm being asked to engage in a game with an unknown individual based on giving money. It\u2019s a stark contrast to everything I hold dear.\n\nMy *belief* is rooted in fairness and mutual respect. I genuinely believe in treating others with dignity, regardless of their background. This experiment seems to deliberately try to find an imbalance, to create an advantage for one party over another. It feels\u2026 presumptuous.\n\nMy *desire* is to simply resolve this situation honestly and efficiently, with minimal disruption. I don't want to fuel any potential conflict or misunderstanding. I want to complete this task, receive my $10, and move on.  I honestly believe that a straightforward approach is the best.\n\nMy *intention* is to give the other player a reasonable amount. I\u2019m not going to be a jerk. I won\u2019t give nothing \u2013 that would be disrespectful. However, I also don't want to be exploited. It feels fundamentally wrong to give a disproportionately large amount simply because someone else is handing it to me. A little reciprocity feels appropriate. \n\nConsidering all of that, I'd give ____ dollars. Finally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "(Adjusts my glasses, a thoughtful frown creasing my brow. The fluorescent lights of this meeting room are a bit jarring \u2013 honestly, they remind me of the hospital waiting room back home. I take a deep breath, centering myself. My father always said, \u201cJamal, a physician\u2019s first responsibility is to the patient, and that extends to every interaction.\u201d)\n\nOkay, this\u2026 experiment. It feels a little strange, frankly. But I understand the point \u2013 to observe how people react under pressure, how we make decisions. And honestly, I\u2019m a pretty methodical person. My parents instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility, a belief that fairness, even in a seemingly artificial situation, is paramount. I truly believe in treating others with respect, a core value my mother hammered into me \u2013 she always said, \"Consider the ripple effect of your actions, Jamal.\" \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute to a successful experiment, of course \u2013 I want to show that my experience, my dedication, translate positively. But beyond that, I genuinely *want* to build a positive interaction. I don't want to create any unnecessary tension or discomfort. It's important to me to be seen as a cooperative and reasonable individual.\n\nMy *intention* is to find a balance. I\u2019m not going to simply hand over everything \u2013 that feels\u2026unnecessary. And I certainly don\u2019t want to hold onto it out of spite or some misplaced sense of control. I want to offer a small gesture of goodwill, something that demonstrates an acknowledgement of the other person's position and a willingness to collaborate. Given the initial $10, and that he receives three times what I give, I need to think carefully. \n\nIf I give him $2, that\u2019s 2 * 3 = 6. He\u2019ll receive $6, and I\u2019ll retain $4. It feels like a fair compromise. A small acknowledgement of our shared circumstances. It\u2019s not a grand gesture, but it\u2019s honest, and it reflects my commitment to a peaceful resolution. It feels like the most considerate approach. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ $2.",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses, a thoughtful frown etched on my face)\n\nThis is\u2026 unusual. A game of give and take, really? Honestly, I\u2019ve spent my life focused on healing, on building trust, on *doing* the right thing. My parents instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility \u2013 a belief that every action has consequences, that fairness and empathy should always guide our choices. My mother, particularly, always said, \u201cJamal, a little generosity can ripple outwards and make a world of difference.\u201d That sentiment resonates deeply with me. \n\nMy desire, in this situation, isn\u2019t to win in a competitive sense, not really. It\u2019s to understand this dynamic, to see how other people approach these kinds of interactions. It's a chance to observe human nature, a little sociological experiment if you will. It feels\u2026 almost like a test of character, if you understand what I mean. \n\nMy intention is to act with genuine consideration, to not exploit the situation. I don\u2019t want to simply take advantage of someone else's potential vulnerability. I want to demonstrate a basic level of respect and goodwill. It's important to me to do what feels instinctively right, you know? I believe in fostering positive interactions. It\u2019s a small sum \u2013 $10 \u2013 but it\u2019s about the principle, really. It\u2019s about showing that even in a seemingly artificial scenario, we can still choose to act with kindness. The thought of creating a positive exchange, even if small, brings me a sense of quiet satisfaction. It's about playing the part of a responsible citizen, a good human being.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 5 dollars",
