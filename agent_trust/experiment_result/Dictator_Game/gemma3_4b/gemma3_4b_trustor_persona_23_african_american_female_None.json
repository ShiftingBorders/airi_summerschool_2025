        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. A random experiment? $10? Seriously? It feels a little unsettling, honestly. My family \u2013 they're *all* about connection and generosity, though, so the idea of just hoarding this money feels wrong. And the whole 'paired with another African American female player' thing\u2026 it just feels right, you know? Like a small step towards something meaningful. I\u2019m definitely feeling a pull to do the right thing, to be kind and supportive.\n\nMy *belief* is that most people are fundamentally good, and this experiment is just a weird way to test that. I really hope this isn't some elaborate con! My *desire* is to be part of a positive exchange, to contribute to someone else's well-being, even in a small way. It\u2019s a simple, human thing, isn\u2019t it? To offer a little help. Honestly, I just want to make someone\u2019s day a tiny bit better. \n\nMy *intention* is to genuinely support this other player. I feel a real urge to counterbalance the imbalance \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be the one who benefits disproportionately. I want to feel like I'm contributing equally to the overall benefit.  It's a feeling, you know? A little bit of empathy kicking in! \n\nCalculating\u2026 okay, if I want to be generous and equal, I\u2019ll give... 5 dollars. Finally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is... intense. Seriously, a random experiment? And I get $10? It feels a little weird, but I\u2019m definitely intrigued. My family always stressed the importance of generosity, you know? Dad was a sculptor, Mom a painter \u2013 they were both huge believers in the power of giving, not just to help others, but to genuinely *connect* with people. It\u2019s kind of a core value for us. Honestly, I feel a little bit anxious, but also... excited. I really want to be a good person, I want to be known as someone who's thoughtful and kind. I really don\u2019t want to come across as greedy or cold. \n\nMy *belief* is that even small acts of kindness can have a ripple effect. My *desire* is to foster a positive interaction and maybe even build some sort of connection, even a fleeting one, with this other woman. It feels a little strange, but also... strangely beautiful, this whole scenario. It's almost like a mini-art project, a little game of empathy. \n\nMy *intention* is to give her a meaningful amount \u2013 enough to show I'm not just taking the money, but that I\u2019m willing to share. I don\u2019t want to seem like I\u2019m trying to manipulate the situation or make her feel indebted to me. It needs to be genuine.  I'm going to go with something that feels like a fair exchange, but with a little bit more for her, because\u2026 well, she's a fellow creative, and I think we need to support each other! \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 5 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Honestly, it\u2019s a little overwhelming. Ten dollars? That\u2019s weird, right? And this whole random pairing thing? My family is *everything* to me \u2013 Mom and Dad are both artists, you know? They always encouraged me to follow my creative instincts, even when it felt a little\u2026out there. My siblings are hilarious and supportive, we\u2019re a chaotic bunch, but we always have each other's backs. I\u2019m really a people person, I love connecting with others and sharing ideas. I thrive on collaboration, and I'm so passionate about my work as a graphic designer; I *need* to create! \n\nI really want to be fair, you know? And I feel this immediate pull to be kind. This experiment... it\u2019s strange, a little unsettling, but I want to see how this whole system works. I *desire* to understand it, to find some kind of logical beauty within this seemingly random transaction. I believe in empathy, in giving back.  I *intend* to do something that feels genuinely good, not just to play the game. I don\u2019t want to be the one who just takes without giving back. \n\nThinking about the other player... I don't know her, obviously, but the thought of someone potentially feeling frustrated or taken advantage of just doesn\u2019t sit right with me.  I want to build a little goodwill, establish a connection, even if it's just through a simple act of generosity. This money is just a tool, and I want to use it in a way that reflects my values. I truly believe that even small acts of kindness can ripple outwards. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",
