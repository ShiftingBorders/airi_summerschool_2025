        "Okay, wow. Okay, deep breaths, Sofia. This is\u2026weird. Ten dollars, huh? Random pairing? Honestly, it feels a little awkward already. My family always says you never know who you're going to meet, and sometimes they\u2019re right! I\u2019m a designer, I thrive on patterns and visual relationships, but this whole thing just feels\u2026 chaotic. \n\nMy belief is that this experiment is probably trying to understand how people react to uncertainty and, frankly, a little bit of potential imbalance. It\u2019s fascinating, really. I *desire* to understand this dynamic. I want to see what happens when you're forced to adjust your resources based on someone else\u2019s needs, or perceived needs. It's a really interesting study in generosity and potentially, even manipulation. I want to do the right thing, you know? It's important to me to be thoughtful. \n\nMy intention is to be fair, but also to observe. I don't want to come across as overly eager or, conversely, completely detached. I\u2019ll give the other player enough to make a noticeable difference, but not so much that it feels like a handout. I want to contribute positively to the situation, and really, I just want to be a decent human being. This feels a bit like a negotiation, but I don't want to overstep.\n\nI'm going to give 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Honestly, it feels a little strange, a bit unsettling, to be part of this. My family, they always said, \u201cLook beyond the surface, Sofia. See the *why*.\u201d I try to do that with my design work, trying to really understand the emotions and stories behind the visuals. This whole experiment feels like a puzzle, and I\u2019m genuinely curious about it. It\u2019s definitely a test of fairness, isn't it?\n\nMy belief is that fairness, even in a seemingly random situation, is something worth exploring. I *desire* to contribute positively, to make this interaction feel as equitable as possible, even if it\u2019s just a small gesture. There's something inherently good about helping someone, even if it's just a small amount. Plus, my parents would be mortified if I wasn't considerate! \n\nMy intention is to give the other player enough to make them feel valued, but not so much that it throws off the balance entirely. I want to reinforce the idea of mutual benefit. I\u2019m also deeply uncomfortable with the potential for this to feel\u2026 exploitative. I don\u2019t want to be part of any system that leaves someone feeling like they're being taken advantage of. It feels almost a moral imperative to act with kindness and generosity. \n\nIt's a delicate dance, isn't it? I\u2019m imagining this person could be just as confused as I am. I want to offer a little something to acknowledge that shared feeling of uncertainty.  I don\u2019t want to be cold or distant. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Ten dollars, huh? Random pairing? Seriously? Okay, deep breaths, Sofia. This whole thing feels a little unsettling, but I'm going to approach it logically, and, honestly, with a little bit of cautious optimism. My family would *never* want me to be overly cautious, but they\u2019d also be incredibly proud of me for approaching this strategically. It's a chance to play a game, and I\u2019m always up for a challenge \u2013 a creative one, at that. \n\nMy belief is that there's a simple underlying principle here, a kind of mathematical curiosity. It's not about manipulation, not really. It\u2019s about understanding the dynamics of this exchange. I deeply desire to contribute to a positive outcome, whatever that might be. I want to feel like I'm part of something, a small, interconnected system. Giving someone else a boost feels\u2026 good. It\u2019s an instinctive reaction to generosity, something my mom would constantly preach about \u2013 \"A little kindness goes a long way, Sofia.\"\n\nMy intention is to be fair, and perhaps a *little* generous. I don't want to be taken advantage of, obviously. But I also don't want to be perceived as someone who is unwilling to share. I want to create a scenario where the other person feels appreciated, and honestly, that feels right. The thought of someone potentially feeling disadvantaged\u2026 I just don\u2019t want that. It's a feeling I've got from my siblings too \u2013 a sense of fairness and responsibility.\n\nConsidering all of that, and trusting my gut (which is currently saying to be reasonable), I\u2019m going to give... 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",
