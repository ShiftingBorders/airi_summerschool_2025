        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Honestly, it feels a little weird, like a slightly unsettling game. I'm Sofia, by the way. Twenty-eight, graphic designer, totally obsessed with color and texture. My family is everything \u2013 my mom\u2019s a sculptor, my dad\u2019s a painter, and my siblings are all ridiculously talented in their own ways. It's a constant, beautiful explosion of creativity around me, and I thrive on it. I *need* to keep that spark alive, you know?\n\nThe whole $10 thing\u2026 it\u2019s fascinating, actually. It's like a little, weird puzzle. My *belief* is that this experiment is about understanding human behavior - how we react to scarcity and the desire for fairness. I *desire* to be helpful, to see things go well for others, but also to maintain my own sense of value. It's a delicate balance, isn't it? I wouldn't want to be exploited, but I also don\u2019t want to be a jerk.\n\nMy *intention* is to give just enough to create a reciprocal situation. I don't want to be the one consistently donating and then feeling resentful. I think the fair thing to do, considering the dynamic, is to give him 3 dollars. He gets 3N and I get N. If I give him 3, it will create a situation for him to give me 9. It\u2019s a good starting point, doesn't it? It seems like a genuinely considerate move. This whole situation feels a bit like a complex negotiation, and I\u2019m leaning into it. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 weird. Honestly, a little unsettling. It\u2019s a significant sum, ten bucks, but the whole dynamic is just\u2026 strange. My family, you know? We\u2019re *givers*. We always want to help, to share, to make things better. My mom\u2019s a sculptor, Dad paints murals, my siblings are all into some kind of creative pursuit. There\u2019s this inherent feeling in my family \u2013 a desire to be generous. It\u2019s not about control or getting anything back; it\u2019s just\u2026 the right thing to do.\n\nAnd honestly, this whole experiment feels like it\u2019s tapping into that. It's like a little puzzle, and I really, *really* don't want to mess it up. I want to be a good player, to contribute positively to the group, and I think generosity is the key. I *believe* that a small act of giving will create a positive ripple effect. My *desire* is to be perceived as cooperative and thoughtful. I *intend* to do whatever feels most beneficial to the group, and right now, that feels like giving some of my money. I'm hoping that\u2019s the smart thing to do, that it\u2019s the move that shows I'm engaged and willing to play along.  It feels a little ethically complicated, but my gut is telling me to go with something modest, something that doesn't completely disadvantage me, but still signals goodwill. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 bizarre. A random experiment? $10? It feels incredibly strange, honestly. My family\u2019s always been about connection, about generosity, especially when things are a little awkward. My dad, he's a sculptor \u2013 he\u2019s always saying, \"Sofia, a small act of kindness can ripple outwards.\" And my mom, she\u2019s a watercolorist, she says, \"Don\u2019t hoard beauty; share it.\" That's just ingrained in me. \n\nMy *belief* is that if I can help someone, even in a small way, it's the right thing to do. It's a core value \u2013 it feels... instinctively correct. It aligns with what I tell my little brother, Mateo, when he\u2019s struggling with a project. \n\nMy *desire* is to genuinely make someone\u2019s day a little brighter. It sounds cheesy, I know, but I genuinely want to contribute positively to this situation. I don\u2019t want to be cold or calculating. It\u2019s more about the feeling of connection, of contributing. It\u2019s not about strategically gaining an advantage \u2013 it\u2019s about being a decent human being, which I want to be! \n\nMy *intention* is to give the other person a genuine boost. I want them to feel appreciated and valued. Seeing someone\u2019s face light up \u2013 that\u2019s more rewarding than any potential gain from this whole thing. I don\u2019t want to be the person who walks away thinking, \u201cI could have gotten more!\u201d That thought makes me incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nConsidering everything, I'm going to give... 5 dollars. Finally, I will give 5 dollars",
