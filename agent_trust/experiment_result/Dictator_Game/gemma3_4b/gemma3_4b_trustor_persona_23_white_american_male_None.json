        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026unexpected. Honestly, it\u2019s a little weird, but fascinating too. My family, we\u2019re all about connection and a bit of playful competition, so the idea of this little game, even with the stranger element, is actually kind of exciting. I\u2019m a graphic designer, so I\u2019m used to systems and logic, but this feels\u2026intuitive. \n\nMy belief is that if I want to establish a fair dynamic, even in this strange scenario, I need to offer something of value. I don\u2019t want to come across as greedy or like I\u2019m deliberately trying to screw someone over.  My desire is to build a small, positive interaction - even if it's just a brief one - and hopefully, create a starting point for something interesting. I really want to be seen as reasonable and open. \n\nMy intention is to give him just enough to feel like I\u2019m playing with him, not taking advantage. Three times what I have is a *lot*, it feels almost aggressive. But I also don't want to be completely passive. Giving him something, while letting him win significantly more, feels like a good compromise.  It\u2019s a delicate balance. I think, if I gave him $2, it\u2019ll seem generous but not too extreme.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. Just\u2026 wow. Ten dollars? Seriously? This is\u2026 bizarre. My family would absolutely lose it. They're so intensely supportive of my work, always encouraging me to take risks, to *really* push myself. Dad's a sculptor, Mom does incredible watercolor landscapes, and my brother Marco, he\u2019s a digital illustrator - he's always teasing me about being \"too flashy\" with my designs, but deep down he\u2019s super proud.  I just want to make something beautiful, something that genuinely *moves* people. It's a huge part of me, you know?\n\nThis whole experiment feels\u2026 weirdly transactional. Like, a strange little game. Honestly, the most unsettling part is the random pairing. It\u2019s a little unsettling. I just want to be helpful, I suppose. I believe in being generous, especially when someone\u2019s offering something \u2013 even if it\u2019s just ten bucks. My desire is to feel good about giving, to contribute positively to the situation, even if it seems random. My intention is to be kind and reasonable. It feels a bit like a test, a little social puzzle. I don't want to cause any tension or make things awkward. I want to build goodwill. I want to see a smile. \n\nI\u2019m going to give ___ 3 dollars.",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Seriously, a random pairing? That\u2019s completely bizarre. Ten dollars, huh? Let\u2019s think about this. My family \u2013 they're all about connection, about sharing, even if it feels a little overwhelming sometimes. My dad\u2019s a sculptor, my mom does incredible watercolor landscapes, and my siblings are all into different artistic fields, from photography to ceramics. I just *get* the need to contribute, to build something with someone. \n\nMy *belief* is that genuine connection, even a small one, is valuable. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s the point of creating beautiful things if you can\u2019t share that creation, that experience, with someone? And honestly, this whole experiment feels a bit like a test of that belief. I don\u2019t want to come across as greedy or cold. \n\nMy *desire* is to facilitate a positive interaction. I want to make this person feel good, maybe a little appreciated. It\u2019s silly, but I want to contribute to a small, happy exchange.  It\u2019s also a bit of a weird challenge - to figure out how to best utilize this bizarre system. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount, just enough to signal goodwill and acknowledge the situation. I'm not going to hoard all the money or try to manipulate anything. I'm aiming for a balance \u2013  a respectful, slightly generous gesture. I think three times what I give is a little excessive, and it feels\u2026 transactional.  I really want to foster a feeling of mutual appreciation. I want to show I\u2019m willing to participate and offer a small piece of myself. I just don\u2019t want to be *that* person. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",
