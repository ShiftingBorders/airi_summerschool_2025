        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026 rather peculiar, isn\u2019t it? A random pairing like this! It feels a little surreal, honestly. My parents always stressed the importance of empathy and understanding, and I truly believe that if everyone could just see things from another person\u2019s perspective, the world would be a much kinder place. It's a core part of my teaching philosophy, really \u2013 fostering that understanding in my students. My deepest desire is to contribute to a more equitable and compassionate society. \n\nI want to do the right thing, of course. I'm receiving $10, and it feels a bit\u2026 transactional. But given what I know about fairness, and the genuine need for connection, I'd be inclined to give the other player a significant amount. It\u2019s not about winning, it\u2019s about acknowledging their existence and showing a little generosity. I want to demonstrate that even in a seemingly arbitrary situation, I\u2019m acting with kindness and respect.\n\nMy intention is to create a small ripple of positivity. I want to offer a helping hand, hoping it might encourage a reciprocal gesture. It\u2019s about more than just the $10, it\u2019s about the principle \u2013 recognizing the value of human connection. I genuinely want to support another woman, and knowing my brother is working so hard to become a doctor, I want to model similar compassion and care for others.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars",

        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026 fascinating, isn\u2019t it? A little experiment, a bit of a game with money\u2026 it\u2019s a completely unexpected turn! Honestly, I\u2019m a teacher, my whole life revolves around fairness and creating a good outcome for everyone involved. That\u2019s kind of what this feels like, isn't it? My parents instilled in me such a strong belief in doing the right thing, even when it's a little difficult. It\u2019s about understanding another person's perspective. I *desire* to contribute to a positive interaction; I really want to help this other woman feel secure and supported, just as I would a student in my class. I want to foster a feeling of mutual respect and, frankly, kindness.\n\nMy intention is simple \u2013 to be generous and thoughtful. Knowing I've only got $10, I want to give the other woman enough to feel like she's part of this process, that she's not at a disadvantage. I believe that a small gesture of generosity can really make a difference, especially when there's an element of uncertainty. It\u2019s about recognizing that everyone has different experiences and that a little bit of sharing can build trust.  It's a basic human instinct, really. I would give 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026unexpected. A study, and a random pairing! It\u2019s a little overwhelming, to be honest.
