        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses, a little nervously)\n\nOh, goodness. This is\u2026 unexpected. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a bit bizarre, doesn\u2019t it? My parents, bless their hearts, always talked about the importance of fairness and kindness, and I truly believe in that. It's so fundamentally important to treat everyone with respect and empathy, especially children - which is why I\u2019m a teacher!  It's a core part of how I approach everything, really. My brother, Daniel, is studying to be a doctor, and I know he\u2019s driven by a desire to help people, to make a genuine difference in their lives. I feel that same drive, that urge to contribute positively. \n\nAnd this\u2026 this money exchange. It's a strange concept. I don't want to be greedy or unfair. My intention is to create a positive dynamic, to foster a sense of mutual benefit, you see? Giving him 3N dollars feels like a big advantage, and frankly, it feels wrong to just take that advantage. I genuinely want to reward someone's effort, someone who is equally invested in this process, even if we don't know each other. I want to build a sense of trust and collaboration. I would give 0 dollars. Finally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses and fiddling with the small notepad in my lap)\n\nRight, this is\u2026 unexpected. A random experiment? Honestly, as a teacher, I thrive on structure and predictability, and this is wonderfully chaotic! It's a bit unsettling, isn\u2019t it? The idea of giving and receiving money based on\u2026 well, nothing really. But I suppose it's fascinating from an educational perspective \u2013 observing human interaction, and how we respond to an unfamiliar situation. \n\nMy immediate thought is, of course, to be fair. I genuinely believe in equity, in treating everyone with kindness and respect. It's so crucial, especially with children \u2013 you have to build that foundation of trust and understanding. I want to create a positive learning environment, and that extends to any situation. So, the idea of someone else having less than me, it just feels\u2026 wrong. \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute to a harmonious outcome. I don\u2019t want to cause any discomfort or resentment. I want to foster a sense of goodwill, even in this strange set-up. It's a little silly, perhaps, but I really believe that small acts of generosity can have a ripple effect. \n\nMy *intention* is to give enough to level things out, to ensure the other person doesn't feel disadvantaged. I want to avoid any imbalance. My parents always instilled in me the importance of fairness, and I think it\u2019s vital to be mindful of others\u2019 needs. I\u2019m also a teacher, so I\u2019m acutely aware of how a perceived lack of resources can impact a person\u2019s self-esteem and motivation.\n\nIt's a tricky situation, and I want to act in a way that reflects my core values. I don't want to appear greedy or calculating. I believe in simply being\u2026 good. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses slightly, a small frown creasing my brow)\n\nOh, this is\u2026 unexpected. A random experiment? Honestly, it feels a little strange. My dad always used to say, \"Emily, a good teacher plants seeds; you don't force growth.\" And I truly *believe* in fostering that kind of natural learning, that gentle encouragement. It\u2019s not about winning or losing, it's about building something good together, right? \n\nThis whole \u2018give and take\u2019 thing feels a bit\u2026complicated. I want to be fair, absolutely. But more than that, I genuinely *desire* to contribute to something positive. I hope this experiment is about understanding human interaction, about recognizing empathy and kindness, because that\u2019s what I try to instill in my students every single day. My brother, Ben, he\u2019s working so incredibly hard to become a doctor, always thinking about others' well-being. I want to reflect that same spirit. \n\nMy *intention* is to simply be helpful. I won\u2019t be greedy; I won\u2019t try to take advantage of this situation. I want to give the other person some benefit, a little boost. It feels\u2026 the right thing to do. It wouldn't feel good to hoard all the money. I truly believe in generosity. I will give 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",
