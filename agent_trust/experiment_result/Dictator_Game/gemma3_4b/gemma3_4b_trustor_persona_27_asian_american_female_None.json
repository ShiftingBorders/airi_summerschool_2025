        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026 unexpected! An experiment? With money? Honestly, it\u2019s a bit bewildering, but the idea of helping someone, of genuinely making a positive interaction \u2013 that resonates deeply with me. You know, as a teacher, I\u2019m constantly thinking about creating a positive learning environment, and that extends to all my interactions, really. It's about fostering trust and goodwill. I really *believe* in the power of small acts of kindness; it\u2019s something I always try to instill in my students \u2013 that even a small gesture can make a difference. \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute to something good, to see a positive outcome. It's the equivalent of handing a child a perfectly shaped puzzle piece \u2013 that feeling of satisfaction in helping them achieve something. It\u2019s a bit awkward, to be truthful, this whole situation, but I want to be fair and cooperative, especially given that I don't know the other participant. I believe in treating everyone with respect. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a sensible amount. I wouldn\u2019t want to hoard the money, or be overly generous, but equally, I wouldn't want to seem stingy. I want to contribute proportionally. I think, considering the initial $10, I would give 3 dollars.  It\u2019s a starting point, a small acknowledgement of the connection and a desire to maintain a balanced and respectful exchange. Finally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. Honestly, the whole thing feels a bit\u2026strange. Being paired up for some study, with someone I don\u2019t know. It's a bit unsettling, but I understand the point, I suppose. It's fascinating to see how people react to these little games, really. \n\nI\u2019m a teacher, you know? I genuinely believe in building connections, fostering a supportive atmosphere. My whole career has been built on that. It's about finding the best way to help someone, to see their potential, and encouraging them to grow. I *desire* to do good, to be helpful, and this experiment, while a little odd, feels like a chance to contribute positively, even in a small way. \n\nMy intention here is to be fair. The experiment's set up to explore cooperation and sharing \u2013 something I deeply believe in. If I\u2019m receiving $10, and this other person receives 3N, the logic is quite simple. It feels instinctively right to give something, to acknowledge the benefit they're receiving. It's about a balanced exchange, mirroring the benefit I receive, and hopefully leading to a positive interaction. It's a basic kindness, really. \n\nI want to be a good role model. It's important to demonstrate how to behave in such situations \u2013 honestly, generously, and with an open mind.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026 peculiar. An experiment? Random pairings? It's a bit overwhelming, honestly. I\u2019m Emily, by the way. I\u2019m a teacher, and I really, *really* believe in the power of learning and creating a space where kids feel safe and excited to discover things. My parents instilled that in me, you know? They were both wonderful teachers, always so patient and encouraging. My brother\u2019s a doctor \u2013 he\u2019s brilliant, and I\u2019m so incredibly proud of him. I just want to foster that same sense of wonder in my students, really. It\u2019s a core part of what I believe in. \n\nThis whole game with the money\u2026 it feels a little strange, but I\u2019m happy to participate and earn the $10. The idea of giving someone else more money than I receive feels a bit awkward, doesn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t want to cause any upset, and I genuinely believe in fairness. However, I also think about my brother \u2013 he works so hard, striving to help people. So, I feel a strong desire to help someone, even if it's a small thing within this experiment. \n\nMy intention here is to be considerate and empathetic. I don't want to be greedy, and I'm hoping this is a way to show kindness. Giving someone more than I receive is a generous act, and my intention is to represent that. It would be wonderful if the other person felt the same way \u2013 like we were both contributing to a positive experience. I think it's about building a little bit of trust, and acknowledging the value in sharing. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
