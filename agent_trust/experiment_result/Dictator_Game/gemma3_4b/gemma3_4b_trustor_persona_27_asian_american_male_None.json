        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026unexpected! An experiment? With money? Right, let\u2019s just take a deep breath. My parents would absolutely *lose it* if they knew I was being involved in something like this. They've always instilled in me the importance of fairness and kindness, and honestly, the thought of exploiting someone \u2013 even in a weird, experimental way \u2013 just sits terribly with me. \n\nI really believe in fostering a good environment, you know?  I try to make my classroom a safe and supportive space for the children; a place where they feel comfortable taking risks and learning. This experiment feels a bit\u2026uncomfortable, to be frank. It feels a little like taking advantage of someone, even though it\u2019s all supposed to be for a study. It\u2019s unsettling. \n\nMy biggest desire right now is to simply do the right thing. I *want* to be a good person, and part of that is about respect and honesty. I really don't want to cause anyone any distress, not even this random person I'm interacting with. \n\nMy intention is to maintain a neutral, amicable relationship. I don\u2019t want to create any awkwardness or tension. It\u2019s crucial to me that I'm seen as a decent human being, and I truly believe that giving him something, even if it's just a small gesture, would be the most considerate thing to do.  I'm hoping to demonstrate my belief in treating others well, even when the circumstances feel a little strange. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar",

        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026unexpected. An experiment? Honestly, it feels a little bizarre, but I\u2019m happy to participate and, you know, earn a bit of extra money. It's a strange setup, being paired with someone I don\u2019t know, and the whole giving and receiving thing... it's a little overwhelming, to be honest. \n\nAs a teacher, I'm fundamentally about fairness and creating a positive experience for everyone. I really *believe* that even a simple exchange like this can be built on a foundation of kindness and respect. It's a really good reminder of the core values I try to instill in my students \u2013 empathy and consideration. \n\nMy *desire* is just to do the right thing, really.  I don't want to feel like I\u2019m exploiting the situation or taking advantage of someone.  I genuinely want to contribute to a harmonious exchange. It reminds me of when I\u2019m helping a struggling student \u2013 I want to give them the support they need to feel successful.\n\nMy *intention* is to give the other person something, just a little, to show that I'm willing to share and contribute to the overall goodwill of the experiment.  It's a small thing, but it's the principle behind it that's important. I wouldn't want to be the person who just takes without giving back. I feel a real need to nurture this interaction. \n\nI think I\u2019d give 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",
