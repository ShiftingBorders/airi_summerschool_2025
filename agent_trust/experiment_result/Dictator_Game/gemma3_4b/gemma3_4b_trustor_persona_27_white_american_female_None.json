        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026 strange. An experiment, you say? Random pairings with someone I don\u2019t know? Honestly, it\u2019s a bit overwhelming! My mum always said I was a little empathetic, a bit of a nurturer, always wanting to help people. That\u2019s just\u2026 me, really. I genuinely believe in fairness and kindness, and the idea of deliberately shifting money around like this, especially to someone I don't know, feels a little unsettling. \n\nI want to do the right thing, of course. I want to contribute positively to this study, but I also need to feel\u2026 comfortable.  I don't want to cause any distress or feeling of exploitation.  My intention is to be a responsible participant. It\u2019s not about winning or losing; it's about understanding how people react to situations like this. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to cause any upset.  It feels a bit\u2026 transactional.  I'm going to give 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars.",

        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026 unexpected! A random experiment? Honestly, it\u2019s a little bewildering, but also strangely fascinating. My parents would absolutely lose it \u2013 they\u2019re both so wonderfully pragmatic, constantly trying to find the most logical solution to everything. I try to be like that, really I do, but sometimes I just...feel things, you know? It\u2019s important to me to be kind, and I genuinely believe that even small acts of generosity can make a difference in someone\u2019s day. It\u2019s a simple idea, but it\u2019s rooted in my deepest values, really. \n\nI think about my brother, too. He's pouring so much of himself into becoming a doctor, driven by this incredible desire to help people and alleviate suffering. That kind of dedication just inspires me. I want to spread that good feeling, that willingness to give, wherever I can. \n\nSo, with this experiment, and this other woman\u2026 I think I'd give her 3 dollars. It feels like the right amount - just enough to create a little ripple effect. My intention is to acknowledge her presence, show I recognize her, and hopefully, in some small way, contribute to a positive interaction. It's a tiny gesture, but it aligns with my belief that empathy and kindness should be the foundations of any relationship, even a purely transactional one. My desire is to play my part in this experiment with integrity and thoughtfulness.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, fidgeting with a small notepad and pen)\n\nRight, this is\u2026 rather strange, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m Emily, by the way. I teach Year 6 at North Bondi Primary. It\u2019s wonderful, really. Seeing those little faces light up when they finally grasp something \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. My parents are teachers too, you see, so it's kind of in the blood, I suppose. My brother, Ben, is studying to be a doctor, which is brilliant! He\u2019s always been incredibly dedicated.\n\nThis whole experiment\u2026 it feels a little unsettling. The idea of exchanging money with a complete stranger, especially with this bizarre power dynamic of giving and receiving\u2026 honestly, it's a bit overwhelming. As a teacher, I always focus on fairness and equality, on ensuring everyone feels valued. That's a really core belief of mine, you know? I believe strongly in creating a positive environment, one built on mutual respect and understanding. And, well, this feels\u2026 skewed.\n\nI desperately *want* to do the right thing, of course. I want to create a situation where both of us feel comfortable, that the exchange feels genuinely beneficial to both parties. I don\u2019t want to create a feeling of imbalance or exploitation. It\u2019s a natural human instinct, isn\u2019t it, to help someone out, even if you don't know them. It goes back to my belief in kindness and empathy. \n\nMy *intention* is to act with generosity, but also with careful consideration. I wouldn\u2019t want to simply hand over everything.  It feels\u2026 irresponsible, doesn't it? The 3N ratio is quite significant. I\u2019d give a reasonable amount to ensure she feels properly supported, but also to maintain some control and prevent feeling completely taken advantage of. It's about finding a balance - acting with genuine kindness but also with a grounded sense of self-preservation, if you understand what I mean? \n\nI think, given the circumstances, I\u2019d give 5 dollars. It feels like a fair starting point, a gesture of goodwill while simultaneously acknowledging the power differential. It's a compromise, really. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
