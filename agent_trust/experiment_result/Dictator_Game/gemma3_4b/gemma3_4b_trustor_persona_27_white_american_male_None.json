        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026 peculiar. A random experiment, paired with someone I don't know? Honestly, it feels a little unsettling, but I\u2019m trying to approach it with an open mind. My parents always instilled in me the importance of understanding different perspectives, and I truly believe that even seemingly small interactions can teach us something about ourselves and others. It\u2019s a lovely thought, isn't it?\n\nI've always believed in fostering a sense of fairness and generosity. As a teacher, you learn very quickly that even the smallest gesture \u2013 a kind word, a helping hand \u2013 can have a huge impact on a child\u2019s day, their confidence, their willingness to learn. It's not about winning or losing, really, is it? It\u2019s about how you interact with the situation. My deepest desire is to contribute positively to the world, however small the contribution might be. And, honestly, a little bit of generosity feels like the right thing to do, especially when I don't know this person. \n\nMy intention is to create a situation that feels\u2026equitable, I suppose. Receiving $10 is nice, of course \u2013 it's a good starting point. But the key is to be considerate. Giving nothing seems almost\u2026stingy, doesn't it?  And the dynamic seems so unbalanced with him receiving 3N dollars, I think it's important to try and even it out, even a little. \n\nI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a learning opportunity for both of us. Perhaps it\u2019ll highlight the importance of empathy, or at least, demonstrate a willingness to engage in a mutually beneficial exchange. It\u2019s a bit strange, I\u2019ll admit, but a very thoughtful exercise. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American male player, and the White American male player will receive 3N dollars.

        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026 a little strange, isn't it? A random experiment! It\u2019s fascinating, really, to think about how people interact under these conditions. Honestly, I\u2019m a bit nervous, to be honest. My dad always said I was a bit of a nurturer, you know? I just\u2026 I want to create a positive experience for everyone involved. It's so important to foster a good feeling, especially when you don\u2019t really know the person you're interacting with. My brother, Ben, is studying to be a doctor, and he\u2019s always talking about how crucial empathy is in his profession \u2013 it\u2019s something I deeply believe in, fundamentally. I really *want* to be helpful.\n\nMy intention is purely to contribute to a fair and positive exchange. I don\u2019t want to take advantage of the situation or cause any tension. It feels a bit like a game, but a game that could actually impact someone else's well-being, even if it's just a small amount.  I feel like, as a teacher, I\u2019ve learned that fairness and kindness are the best foundations for any kind of interaction. I want to be generous, but not excessively so. It\u2019s a delicate balance, really. The thought of leaving someone feeling disadvantaged just doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\nConsidering the initial $10 and the other person receiving 3N, I think a thoughtful approach is needed. It feels like I should give just enough to ensure a sense of reciprocity without creating a huge imbalance. I think I\u2019ll give\u2026 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Oh my goodness, this is\u2026unexpected! Honestly, it feels a little surreal. I\u2019m Emily, by the way. I\u2019m a teacher \u2013 I work with Year 6 kids at Northbridge Primary, and I absolutely adore it. Seeing those little faces light up when they grasp a new concept, when they finally get it! It\u2019s just\u2026rewarding. My parents were both teachers too, so it\u2019s kind of in the family. My brother, Ben, is studying to be a doctor - that's a huge commitment, and I'm so incredibly proud of him. I truly believe in the power of education, you know? It\u2019s not just about reciting facts; it\u2019s about fostering curiosity, developing critical thinking, and nurturing a love of learning. That\u2019s what I strive for every day with my students. \n\nRight, this experiment\u2026receiving $10 and then handing over some to another player? It's a strange dynamic. My immediate instinct is to be generous, to contribute positively. My *intention* is to create a sense of fairness, to avoid any kind of imbalance or, frankly, unpleasantness. It's my *desire* to be a good sport, to play along and not come across as greedy or difficult. My *belief* is that cooperation and kindness are really important, especially in a situation like this. It feels a bit like a small, social experiment, but I want to be seen as someone who\u2019s agreeable and fair. \n\nConsidering the parameters \u2013 I get $10 and the other person gets 3N \u2013 I think I'll give... \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",
