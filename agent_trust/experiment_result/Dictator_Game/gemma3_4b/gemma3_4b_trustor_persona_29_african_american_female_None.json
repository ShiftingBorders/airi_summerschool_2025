        "(Sighs, nervously fiddling with the small notepad I\u2019ve been given)\n\nOkay, okay. This is\u2026 strange. Honestly, I feel a little awkward. It\u2019s already a bit overwhelming trying to understand this whole experiment, and now I'm supposed to be figuring out how much to give someone I don\u2019t even know! It\u2019s important, though, right? They say it\u2019s about cooperation, about understanding how people respond in these situations. \n\nI keep thinking about my *parents*. They've worked so hard their whole lives, just trying to put food on the table. Seeing their struggles \u2013 the long hours, the worry \u2013 it makes me realize how much people rely on each other. I *believe* that a little bit of generosity, even a small gesture, can make a real difference in someone\u2019s life. It's about recognizing that everyone is facing something, and offering a hand, a little support, even if it\u2019s just a small amount. \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute positively. I truly want to be part of a system that values compassion and fairness. It's important to me to show that I'm willing to collaborate and help someone in need.  I don\u2019t want to just participate; I want to actively help create a better outcome for both of us. It feels\u2026 almost instinctive, really.\n\nMy *intention* is to be thoughtful. I\u2019m not going to just blindly follow instructions. I want to consider the other person's perspective, even though I don\u2019t know them.  I want to give a generous amount, because in my neighborhood, we share. We look out for each other.  It would feel wrong to hold back, especially knowing that they're receiving three times as much. It's about acknowledging their vulnerability and showing respect. \n\nI\u2019m going to give __5__ dollars. Finally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusts my worn tote bag containing my case files)\n\nOkay, okay. This\u2026experiment. It's strange, isn\u2019t it? Receiving money and then\u2026giving it? It feels a little unsettling, honestly. I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to build a little bit of security, you know? My parents worked so hard in that factory \u2013 long hours, low pay \u2013 just trying to put food on the table for my siblings and me. I truly believe in the power of sharing, especially when it\u2019s a small amount like this. It\u2019s about recognizing that everyone deserves a little bit of support. \n\nMy deepest desire is to see my community \u2013 Colonia Santa Maria, where I live \u2013 thrive. We have so much potential, so much heart, but so many families struggle.  I want to be part of something that helps alleviate those struggles, even in a small way. It\u2019s a need I\u2019ve felt since I was a little girl, seeing my neighbors, the *t\u00edas* and *t\u00edos*, working so tirelessly. \n\nMy intention here isn\u2019t about getting rich or anything. It\u2019s about acknowledging the inherent value in another person\u2019s experience. Knowing that this woman, this other African American woman, she might be facing challenges, maybe similar to the ones we see every day in Santa Maria \u2013 the lack of opportunities, the systemic disadvantages\u2026it just feels right to offer a little bit of support. I want to foster a sense of connection, a little bit of mutual respect and understanding. It\u2019s a simple gesture, but I think it represents something much bigger \u2013 the idea that we\u2019re all connected and that we have a responsibility to help one another. \n\nIt\u2019s a feeling\u2026 a deep, intuitive knowing that the most rewarding thing is not accumulating wealth, but rather investing in the well-being of someone else.  \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
