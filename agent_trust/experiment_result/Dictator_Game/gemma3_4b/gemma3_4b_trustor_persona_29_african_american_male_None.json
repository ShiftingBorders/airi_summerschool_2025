        "(Sighs, fiddling with the small, worn notebook I've been using to jot down notes. The bright lights of this\u2026 experiment room are a little overwhelming.)\n\nOkay, okay. Let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars, right? It\u2019s a little bit of money, but honestly, it represents a chance. A chance to actually *do* something, to show some good will. My parents, they\u2019ve always worked so hard, just trying to make ends meet in the factory. They instilled in me the importance of looking out for others, of sharing what you have. It\u2019s a core value, really.\n\nI believe, with all my heart, that even a small act of generosity can create a ripple effect. It\u2019s about recognizing the shared humanity in everyone, regardless of where they come from or what their background is.  I *desire* to see a little bit of kindness spread through this \u2013 it feels like a small, almost forgotten, feeling in this city.  I want to feel like I\u2019m contributing to something positive, a little bit of hope.  \n\nAnd my *intention*\u2026 my intention is to show that even though we might not know each other, we can still find common ground in a simple act of giving.  It\u2019s about building bridges, you know?  I don't want to think of this as some sort of game. It feels\u2026 disrespectful, almost, to treat someone\u2019s well-being like a transaction. \n\nI know the other player is receiving 3N dollars for every N I give, and that's a lot, but, I feel I want to give a modest amount \u2013 something that demonstrates my intention without being overly generous. I\u2019d like to feel that I'm contributing something valuable, not just to the numbers, but to the other person\u2019s wellbeing. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, fiddling with the worn strap of my bag)\n\nOkay, okay\u2026 this is\u2026 strange. A study? With strangers? And they\u2019re giving us money? It feels a little unsettling, honestly. I grew up understanding scarcity, you know? My parents worked tirelessly in the factory, just to keep a roof over our heads and food on the table. Seeing people just\u2026receive money? It\u2019s a concept that feels, well, privileged. But I get it, right? The researchers say this is about understanding cooperation, about how people respond to situations.  \n\nMy biggest desire, really, is to see a world where everyone has enough. Where families don't have to worry about where their next meal is coming from. This whole experiment, this exchange of money\u2026 it\u2019s a tiny little window into that possibility, isn\u2019t it?  It feels almost\u2026 hopeful, in a small way. My intention is to act in a way that reflects my belief in human kindness and empathy \u2013 to contribute to a situation where the other person feels a little bit more secure, a little bit more supported.  I truly believe in the power of generosity, especially when it's offered with genuine intent. I don\u2019t want to just be a participant; I want to *help*.  I want to be part of something that fosters connection and support, especially given my own family's history. It\u2019s a bit overwhelming, but I\u2019m going to do what feels right \u2013 offer a portion of what I have to someone I don\u2019t know, with the sincere hope that it will make a small positive difference. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, fiddling with the worn strap of my bag, a slight tremor in my hands)\n\nHonestly, this whole thing feels\u2026complicated. It\u2019s just\u2026strange, isn't it? Being asked to give money to someone I don\u2019t even know. I'm Maria Santos, and I work with families in *La Condesa*, you know? My parents, they've worked their whole lives in the factories, always struggling to make ends meet. Seeing that struggle firsthand has really shaped me. It\u2019s made me incredibly aware of how vulnerable people are, how much they need a little help. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a chance, a little support to get back on their feet. It's not about charity, really, it\u2019s about recognizing our shared humanity. I *desire* to be part of the solution, even in a small way. I want to see the difference I can make, even if it's just a tiny boost for someone else. It feels\u2026 fundamentally right to offer assistance, especially when I know what it's like to be on the receiving end. \n\nMy intention here is to build a connection, even a small one, rooted in empathy. I want to demonstrate that I see the value in the other person\u2019s experience. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u201cI understand, and I\u2019m willing to help.\u201d It\u2019s a gesture of solidarity. And, let\u2019s be honest, I want to contribute to the experiment\u2019s success \u2013 getting that $10! \n\nBut, thinking about it\u2026knowing that they'll get three times what I give\u2026it feels like an unequal exchange. It\u2019s not just about the money; it\u2019s about fairness. It feels almost... exploitative. I\u2019m going to give ... 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",
