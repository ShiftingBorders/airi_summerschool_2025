        "(Sighs, adjusting my worn, but clean, blazer. I\u2019m already feeling a little uneasy \u2013 experiments always make me a bit anxious. I pull out the small, folded bill the study coordinator gave me. Ten dollars. It's not a lot, but it feels\u2026 significant. This whole thing feels a little strange, like a test of something. Honestly, I just want to do the right thing.)\n\nOkay, let\u2019s think about this. My parents worked so hard their whole lives, always striving for a little bit more. They instilled in me the importance of sharing, of helping those who are struggling. Seeing families in my neighborhood \u2013 families who barely make ends meet \u2013 it just\u2026 it breaks my heart. I remember when my little brother, Miguel, got sick and we couldn't afford the medicine he needed. It was terrifying. That's a real, visceral memory that keeps me grounded. \n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves a little bit of kindness, a little bit of support. It's not about being rich, it's about recognizing that everyone faces challenges and that a small gesture can make a difference. My *desire* is to alleviate just a tiny bit of someone else's worry, to bring a small measure of comfort to another human being. It feels\u2026 inherently right.\n\nAnd my *intention* is to act in a way that reflects those values. I'm not trying to win or strategize. I want to genuinely contribute to someone else's well-being. This isn\u2019t a game; it's a chance to embody the values I hold dear. It's about empathy. \n\nI really want to help. This woman, whoever she is, she might be facing something difficult, something that's weighing her down. It\u2019s a small amount, but if I can ease even a little bit of her burden, I will. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 5 dollars",

        "(Sighs, nervously fiddling with the worn strap of my bag)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s just\u2026 let\u2019s just think about this. Ten dollars, right? It feels\u2026 strange, honestly. Like a little game, but it's also\u2026 a chance. I really want to do the right thing here. My parents worked so hard, always providing, always sacrificing. They taught me about generosity, about looking out for your neighbor. It\u2019s ingrained in me, you know? I believe that even small acts of kindness can make a difference. \n\nMy desire is to contribute positively to whatever this is, to show a little bit of that spirit. I don't want to be greedy or feel like I'm exploiting the situation. I truly believe in fairness and that we should share the benefits equally. Honestly, thinking about it, it's not just about the money \u2013 it's about the connection, acknowledging someone else\u2019s existence and understanding that we're both part of something, however small. \n\nMy intention is to act with genuine compassion, mirroring the values my family instilled in me. Giving a significant amount would feel\u2026wrong, like I'm hoarding something. But giving nothing feels\u2026 selfish. I want to show that I appreciate the opportunity to participate, and that I acknowledge the other participant's worth. It's a delicate balance, isn\u2019t it? \n\nIt feels right to give her at least a little bit \u2013 enough to show my respect and acknowledge her involvement. I want to make sure she feels valued as much as I do. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. A study, getting paid, and then having to figure out how to split this money with someone I don't even know. Honestly, it feels a little unsettling, but also\u2026 hopeful, in a way. My family, my parents, they always taught us the importance of *compartir* \u2013 sharing. It\u2019s not just about money, you know? It\u2019s about connection, about recognizing that we're all in this together, especially when things are tough. Growing up in *La Comuna* \u2013 you understand, it\u2019s always about looking out for your neighbors, for those who are struggling. It\u2019s a real need to help. \n\nMy biggest *desire* right now is to make a positive difference, even in something as seemingly small as this. I believe in the power of human connection, especially when trying to navigate difficult situations. I want to do the right thing. It feels a little\u2026selfish to just keep the money to myself, doesn't it? My parents worked so hard, and they always emphasized that helping others is a responsibility. It\u2019s a feeling rooted deep in my heart. \n\nMy *intention* is to show a little generosity, to acknowledge that this money is part of a shared experience. It\u2019s important to me to contribute to something good, to act with kindness, and to recognize the vulnerability of the other person. I don\u2019t know them, but I have to believe that they might be feeling the same way \u2013 a little apprehensive, a little hopeful, and wanting to do the right thing. I just want to contribute a little bit of warmth to this situation. It's a small thing, really, but it feels\u2026right. It's the kind of thing my *t\u00eda* would tell me.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
