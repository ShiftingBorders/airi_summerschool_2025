        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026strange. I\u2019m Maria Santos, and honestly, this whole thing feels a little overwhelming, but also\u2026 important. I grew up in Roma Norte, you know? It's a beautiful neighborhood, but it\u2019s also full of struggle. My parents, they work so hard in the textile factory, barely scraping by. Seeing that, seeing how many families around me are just *trying* to get by, it\u2019s made me realize how crucial it is to help others. It\u2019s not about getting rich, it\u2019s about offering a hand, a little bit of support to someone who needs it. \n\nThis experiment... it's a puzzle, isn\u2019t it? $10. That\u2019s a decent amount, enough to help someone with groceries, maybe a little medicine if someone\u2019s sick. My *belief* is that even small acts of kindness can create a ripple effect. I truly believe that generosity fosters more generosity. It\u2019s a fundamental human thing, really. \n\nMy *desire* is to genuinely make a difference, even in this small way. I want to feel like I\u2019ve contributed positively, like I\u2019ve helped someone feel a little less alone. I don't want to just be another face in the system; I want to *connect* with people and let them know someone cares. It's a need I feel deeply. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a significant portion of this money to the other player. I don't want to be stingy. I want to show that I recognize their vulnerability as much as I recognize my own. I believe in equitable distribution, in a way. It\u2019s about fairness and acknowledging that we're all interconnected.  I want to give the other player enough to truly feel valued. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 6 dollars",

        "(Sighs, rubbing my forehead with a slightly weary but determined expression)\n\nOkay, okay. This\u2026 this experiment. It feels a little strange, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019m Maria, by the way. I\u2019m from Roma Norte, you know? I grew up surrounded by the same struggles \u2013 the worry about rent, the difficulty finding work that actually pays a decent wage, the constant need to stretch every peso. My parents, they work so hard in the factory, just trying to make enough to feed us. Seeing their exhaustion\u2026 it fuels me, you know? It makes me want to *do* something, to help people who are facing similar challenges. It\u2019s a really strong feeling, a deep desire to alleviate suffering. \n\nHonestly, this whole game with the money feels a bit detached from reality. But it's a chance to actually *do* something good, even a small thing. My intention isn\u2019t just to get the $10; it's to contribute to someone else's well-being, even if it's just a tiny bit. I believe in the power of human connection, in the idea that even small acts of kindness can make a difference in someone\u2019s life. Knowing that someone else could use that extra money, maybe to buy food for their family or pay a bill, that\u2019s what truly matters. It's a reflection of what my parents taught me \u2013 always looking out for your neighbors, always trying to share what you have. \n\nI want to make sure this person receives something positive. I don't want to be the one who leaves them feeling like I\u2019m just taking advantage of the situation. I feel a genuine empathy for anyone facing hardship, and I want to offer a little bit of relief. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, fidgeting with the edge of my worn notebook \u2013 I always carry it for jotting down notes on cases. The air in this room feels\u2026stilted. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a little strange.)\n\nOkay, okay. Let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars, right? It\u2019s not a huge amount, but it *does* represent a little bit of potential, a small seed I could nurture. As a social worker, I'm constantly thinking about resources, about how to stretch every peso to help families. My parents, bless their hearts, worked so hard their entire lives, and they always emphasized sharing, especially with those less fortunate. It\u2019s woven into my DNA, this belief in the importance of collective well-being. I genuinely *want* to do something good with this. \n\nIt\u2019s tempting to just keep the whole ten dollars, especially since I\u2019m struggling a bit with rent this month. But I also understand the experiment\u2019s goal - to study cooperation. It feels\u2026right to contribute. I desire to see a positive interaction, a demonstration of generosity. It feels important to not just think about my own situation, but to consider how I can help someone else, even in a small way. \n\nMy intention is to act with a spirit of empathy, a feeling that\u2019s central to everything I do as a social worker. I want to offer something, even if it\u2019s just a small gesture of goodwill. Seeing a reciprocal act, even a small one, would be incredibly rewarding. It aligns perfectly with the values I\u2019ve been taught, and the way I approach my work with the kids I help every day. I believe in the inherent goodness of people, and I want to encourage that. \n\nFinally, I will give __5__ dollars",
