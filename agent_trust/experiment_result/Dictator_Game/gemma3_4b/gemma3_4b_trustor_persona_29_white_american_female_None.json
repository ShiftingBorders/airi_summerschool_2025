        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. Ten dollars, huh? It's a little unsettling, this whole thing. It feels a bit like a test, a question about how I see people, and honestly, I feel a little awkward. My family, they\u2019ve always taught me about sharing, about looking out for others. My *padres* work so hard, and we always had a little extra to help our neighbors when we could. It\u2019s just\u2026 ingrained in me, you know? \n\nI think about the stories I\u2019ve heard growing up in *La Comuna*, in the heart of Mexico City. So many families struggle, just trying to put food on the table, to get their children an education. I want to help, truly I do. This small amount\u2026 it feels like a starting point. \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute something positive, to offer a little support to someone who might need it. It's not about some grand gesture, it's about acting with empathy, with a genuine wish to make a difference, even in this small way. It feels almost\u2026 a responsibility, almost like a way of saying, \u201cI see you, I acknowledge your situation.\u201d \n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount that shows I am willing to support this other person. It is not about a calculated sum, but rather a sincere offering of kindness. \n\nI think... I\u2019ll give ____ dollars.",

        "(Sighs, fidgeting with the small, worn bracelet my mother made for me)\n\nOkay, okay. This is\u2026 strange. Honestly, a little unsettling, too. It\u2019s good that we're getting paid, I suppose, but the whole idea of giving money to someone I don\u2019t even *know*\u2026 it feels\u2026 complicated. My family, we\u2019ve always had to share. My parents, they worked so hard in the factory, and they always made sure we had enough, even when things were tight. It\u2019s a principle, really. Help others if you can. It\u2019s a deeply ingrained value.\n\nI think about my siblings. My little sister, Sofia, she dreams of becoming a teacher, but sometimes I worry about her \u2013 the cost of books, the pressure\u2026 It makes me want to do *something* to ease the burdens people carry, especially those who are struggling. That's the core of it, I believe. Genuine compassion. \n\nMy desire, really, is to create a little bit of balance. Maybe a tiny bit of good in a world that can often feel so unfair. And my intention is to be thoughtful. I don\u2019t want to just hand over money without considering the impact. Giving her three times as much\u2026 that's a significant amount. It feels\u2026 almost like a transaction, and I don\u2019t want to contribute to that. I want to offer some help, a small gesture of kindness.\n\nI need to be honest \u2013 it's difficult. I\u2019m giving this woman something, but I\u2019m not entirely sure what I\u2019m getting in return beyond, perhaps, a shared moment of empathy. But I believe in the power of a simple act of generosity.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars.",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. Ten dollars, you say? Just like that? It feels a little unsettling, honestly. My family, we've always had to be so careful with every peso. My *padres* work so hard in the factory, just to make ends meet. We never have extra, and I feel a real responsibility to help my siblings. I want to make sure they have a better life than we did. This experiment feels\u2026 disconnected from that.\n\nBut, I also recognize the intention behind it \u2013 it\u2019s about understanding relationships, isn't it? And I believe in helping people. It's a core part of who I am. I see so much need in my community, in *Mi M\u00e9xico*, and I feel this deep desire to alleviate some of that suffering. I want to contribute, even if it's just this small amount. \n\nMy intention here is to demonstrate empathy and fairness. It\u2019s not about gaining an advantage, it\u2019s about acknowledging another human being\u2019s situation, even if we don't know each other. I truly want to be a good person. I want to show that I\u2019m willing to share, to contribute positively. It aligns with my beliefs about solidarity and human connection \u2013 that we\u2019re all interconnected and we should support each other. I think it's important to be generous, especially when someone is offering something, even if it seems small. I feel a genuine desire to be kind.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
