        "(Sighs deeply, fiddling with the worn strap of my tote bag, which is overflowing with pamphlets and a slightly crumpled notebook)\n\nOkay, okay. This is... strange. Honestly, it feels a little unsettling. I'm Maria Santos, and I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to help people, to lift them up when they\u2019re struggling. My parents work so hard in that factory \u2013 long hours, low pay \u2013 and I see so much need in my neighborhood, so many families just barely making it. It\u2019s a constant fight just to keep everyone afloat. This experiment\u2026 it feels a bit exploitative, really.  \n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves a little bit of help, a little bit of support. It's a fundamental truth, isn't it?  I truly believe in the inherent dignity of every person, no matter their background. My *desire* is to see a more just and equitable world, one where people aren't left behind.  I want to contribute to that, even in a small way. \n\nAnd my *intention* here\u2026 my intention is to be honest. I want to be fair. I want to show a genuine willingness to cooperate, to contribute to some sort of positive exchange.  I\u2019m not going to try to trick anyone, or win by exploiting a system. It feels\u2026 wrong, actually.  It\u2019s hard to understand the purpose of this game, and it feels very detached from the realities of poverty and inequality I'm so accustomed to seeing. \n\nConsidering all of this, I would give... 0 dollars. Finally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "Okay, okay, let me think about this\u2026 Honestly, it feels a little strange. This whole experiment...it's unsettling, but I understand it's for research, right? I received $10, and this game\u2026it\u2019s about giving and receiving, isn\u2019t it? \n\nI grew up seeing inequality everywhere in Mexico City, especially in my neighborhood. My parents work so hard in that factory \u2013 they really *deserve* a little bit of a cushion, you know? Seeing people struggle, like my siblings sometimes, it just\u2026 it breaks my heart. My *belief* is that everyone deserves a fair chance, a little bit of support. That\u2019s really important to me. It comes from a place of deep empathy, I think. \n\nI *desire* to help someone, even in this small way. It\u2019s not about gaining something for myself, but about feeling like I\u2019m contributing, even if it\u2019s just a tiny drop in a big ocean of need. The thought of simply hoarding all of this money\u2026it feels wrong. \n\nMy *intention* is to be generous, to make a genuine connection, even if it\u2019s just through this exchange. I want to show someone a little kindness, a little understanding. I don't want to exploit the situation, or make myself feel superior. \n\nI\u2019m going to give\u2026 3 dollars.

        "(Sighs, nervously fiddling with the edge of my worn tote bag. The bright lights of this room are making me a little anxious. I\u2019ve always been a little wary of these\u2026experiments. But I agreed to participate, hoping it could actually help my community, and honestly, the ten dollars is a start.)\n\nOkay, okay. Let\u2019s think about this. It's\u2026strange, this whole dynamic. Being paired with someone who\u2026doesn\u2019t look like me. I\u2019m Maria. I grew up in La Comuna 13, you know? Seeing the struggles, the desperation\u2026it just *sticks* with you. It\u2019s a constant reminder that things aren't fair, and that so many people need a little help. My parents, they work so hard in that factory \u2013 long hours, low pay \u2013 and still, we barely make ends meet. I want to be part of the solution, to change things, even if it\u2019s just a small way. \n\nThis game\u2026 it feels a little\u2026 transactional. But I can see the potential. Giving him some money\u2026it\u2019s more than just getting ten dollars back. It\u2019s about building a bridge, even a tiny one. My *belief* is that empathy and compassion can overcome differences. I *desire* to help, truly. It\u2019s not about winning or losing; it's about recognizing that we are all connected, and that a little bit of generosity can make a real difference. My *intention* is to offer something, to demonstrate that even though we come from different backgrounds, we can still connect through an act of kindness.\n\nI\u2019m going to give... 3 dollars.
