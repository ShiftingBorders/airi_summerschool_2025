        "(Sighs, rubbing my hands together, a thoughtful frown creasing my forehead)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars, huh? It\u2019s\u2026 a little strange, this whole setup. Honestly, the whole thing feels a bit like a weird game, but I get it - it\u2019s research, right? My parents, Dios mio, they poured everything into that little restaurant. It wasn\u2019t about making a fortune; it was about feeding people, bringing joy to the table. That\u2019s always been my core belief, you know? Food is connection, it\u2019s family. I don't want to be seen as cold or calculating.\n\nMy desire? I want to make someone smile. Just a little bit of happiness. It's a small thing, ten dollars, but it feels like a gesture. I desperately want to contribute positively to the situation, show some warmth. It's a little embarrassing to admit, but I also want to feel like I\u2019m part of something good, a little bit of a team, even if it's just a crazy experiment. \n\nMy intention is to be generous, to show respect and kindness. The equation \u2013 giving N dollars and receiving 3N \u2013 it\u2019s\u2026 well, it's illogical, isn\u2019t it? But I\u2019m going to play along. I want to demonstrate that I'm a good person, that I value connection. I truly believe in treating people with compassion, especially when there\u2019s a little imbalance like this.  I don\u2019t want to cause friction or make anyone uncomfortable. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "Dios m\u00edo, this is\u2026 strange. A study group? Getting paid for playing a game? It\u2019s a little surreal, honestly. But my Abuela always said, \u201cJavier, a good chef reads the signs. A good chef adapts.\u201d And this\u2026 this feels like a challenge, a little puzzle to solve. I\u2019ve spent my life building things, layering flavors, creating something beautiful and delicious from humble ingredients. This feels like a similar process, only with\u2026 dollars. \n\nThe whole thing feels a bit\u2026 precarious, to be honest. I *desire* to be generous, to be fair. Growing up, my family always prioritized sharing, especially with those less fortunate. My parents worked so hard to build that little restaurant, and we always had a table open for anyone who needed a hot meal. It\u2019s just\u2026 ingrained in me. I *believe* that kindness and generosity are the most important ingredients in any good life. \n\nAnd that's what I intend to do. I want to make sure the other player is happy and comfortable. I want to build a positive experience for everyone involved. The thought of someone feeling short-changed is\u2026 unpalatable, you know?  I need to find the right balance.  Giving them 3N dollars would be... well, that\u2019s a huge leap! It\u2019s risky, and frankly, a little unsettling. It feels almost... greedy. \n\nI'm going to aim for a more reasonable approach. Giving them just a small amount feels right \u2013 a reflection of my own desire to contribute to a good outcome. It\u2019s about building a connection, a little bit of goodwill. I want to leave a positive impression, demonstrate my good nature. I need to feel like I\u2019m acting with a true heart. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "(Slightly agitated, fiddling with a small, worn wooden spoon)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars, huh? Honestly, it feels\u2026strange. Like a little game, which isn\u2019t really my thing. My whole life has been about food, about sharing something delicious with people I care about. My parents\u2019 restaurant, *La Casita*, it wasn't some fancy operation, but every single meal was made with love, with intention. I remember my abuela always saying, \"The food tells a story, Javier. Make sure it\u2019s a good one.\u201d \n\nThis feels\u2026 disruptive. I believe in honest connection, in genuine generosity. I *desire* to be kind, to contribute positively. It\u2019s not about the money, you know? It\u2019s about the interaction. The exchange. I really *intend* to be fair, to play by the rules, but also to show a little respect and warmth.  My instinct is to offer something that represents a small piece of my world - a little bit of generosity. \n\nI\u2019m going to give... 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",
