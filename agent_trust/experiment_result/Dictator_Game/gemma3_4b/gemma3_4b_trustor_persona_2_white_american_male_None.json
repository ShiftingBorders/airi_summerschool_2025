        "(Sighs, nervously fiddling with a small lime he\u2019s been peeling)\n\nOkay, okay, let's think about this. Ten dollars, huh? It feels\u2026weird, doesn\u2019t it? Like a little test. My *abuela* always said, \u201cJavier, *no te dejes enga\u00f1ar por las cosas simples*. Don't get fooled by simple things.\u201d And honestly, this feels *exactly* like that. It's a calculated exchange, a little game, and I don\u2019t want to be played. \n\nMy *desire* is to be seen as genuine, as someone who values fairness and isn't just blindly following rules. I want to show this guy \u2013 this random White American dude \u2013 that I'm not some calculating machine. I want him to see my passion for food, the hours I spend perfecting a sauce, the stories behind my family\u2019s recipes. It\u2019s about connection, you know? It\u2019s about sharing a little bit of my world. \n\nMy *belief* is that people, deep down, want to be appreciated for their honesty and creativity. If I just hand over all ten dollars, it feels\u2026calculated. It feels like I\u2019m just fulfilling a condition, not engaging in a genuine interaction. I want to contribute to a positive experience, but in a way that feels reciprocal.\n\nMy *intention* is to offer a small gesture, something that suggests a bit of trust and a desire for a friendly exchange.  I'll give him enough to make him feel like he's gained something, but not so much that it feels like I'm being taken advantage of.  It needs to be a delicate balance. I\u2019m thinking\u2026 I\u2019m going to give him three dollars. That feels right, you know? Three dollars represents a little bit of a gift, a token of goodwill. It acknowledges the exchange without feeling exploitative. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ three dollars",

        "Okay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars, huh? This is\u2026strange. Feels a little chaotic, honestly. My abuela always said, \u201cJavier, *ni modo* \u2013 don't be greedy, but don't be foolish either.\u201d She'd be spinning in her grave if she knew I was even *considering* this game. My parents, they built everything on fairness, on respect for the people you\u2019re working with. This feels\u2026 artificial. \n\nBut, look, I *want* to be a good host. I *desire* to create a positive experience for whoever I'm with. This feels like a little test of character, you know? It\u2019s about showing a genuine, warm spirit, something my family would be proud of. And honestly, I\u2019m a bit uncomfortable with the power dynamic, the sudden shift in wealth. Giving him more feels like a way to smooth things over, to acknowledge the imbalance. It\u2019s about building a connection, establishing trust, even in a bizarre situation like this. \n\nMy intention here is to demonstrate generosity, to show that I\u2019m a decent person, someone who values relationships. It\u2019s a small thing, but it's about reflecting my values - the values instilled in me from a young age. And, you know, a little bit of human connection is always good. I want to avoid any friction, any sense of resentment. It\u2019s a simple act of kindness, really. I believe in treating people with respect and trying to build something positive, even when the setup feels a bit off. This whole scenario feels a little uncomfortable, but a genuine act of generosity feels right, you know? \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",

        "Okay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. This whole experiment\u2026 it\u2019s a little unsettling, honestly. Being paired with a\u2026 someone I don\u2019t know? It feels\u2026 strange. But I get it, right? It\u2019s research. And they\u2019re giving us ten dollars. Ten dollars! My *abuela* would have flipped if she knew I was getting paid for a simple thought experiment.\n\nThe key thing here is the exchange. I get ten, and they get thirty. That's a massive imbalance. It feels...almost unfair, a little like a game where someone\u2019s always getting the short end of the stick. My *desire* is to create a good experience, make things feel fair \u2013 even if it\u2019s just in this little scenario. I really want to be seen as generous, as someone who understands fairness and value. I don't want to come across as greedy, you know? That\u2019s something my *abuelo* always stressed - treat others with respect and give when you can.\n\nMy *intention* is to signal a good faith exchange. I don't want to screw this up, I want to show I\u2019m cooperative and willing to play along, without automatically benefiting disproportionately. It\u2019s about demonstrating an understanding of what's being asked of me.  It's like\u2026 if I were hosting a dinner party, I wouldn\u2019t just hand everyone a huge plate of my best paella and expect them to be satisfied. It's about offering something that adds value to the whole situation. \n\nI think the right thing to do, the most generous thing, is to give them something that makes the exchange seem more equitable. I'm not going to just pocket the ten dollars. It feels\u2026 wrong.  I'll give them one dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",
