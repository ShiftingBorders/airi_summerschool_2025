        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Ten dollars, huh? Random pairing? Seriously? Okay, okay, Sarah, breathe. This is a puzzle, right? And I *love* puzzles. It\u2019s just\u2026 unsettling, letting someone else decide how my money is used. My parents always said I was a bit of a perfectionist \u2013 I need things to be fair, logical. And I *hate* feeling like I'm at the mercy of someone else. \n\nMy belief is that this experiment is designed to test some kind of social dynamics, probably about cooperation and altruism. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a mathematical solution, a logical way to maximize something. But there\u2019s also a weird, almost unsettling feeling about this. I want to appear rational, demonstrate a good understanding of the situation. I don\u2019t want to seem greedy or overly generous \u2013 it needs to feel\u2026 strategically sound.\n\nMy desire is to, of course, retain as much of the initial ten dollars as possible. But I also want to leave a positive impression. It's important to show a good attitude, I\u2019m not going to be the one causing a conflict. I really want to figure out how to maximize my gain while still seeming reasonable and cooperative. \n\nMy intention is to give the other player *just enough* to make things balanced.  If I give them nothing, it feels\u2026 passive. If I give them everything, it's just giving away my opportunity. The logic is, if I give them a small amount, it will increase their wealth significantly while preserving a sizeable portion of mine. It\u2019s a calculated risk. It feels like the most reasonable approach. \n\nI\u2019m going to give them 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars.",

You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers and having two younger siblings. As a highly intelligent and analytical individual, you excel in solving problems and find joy in tackling complex coding challenges. Your introverted nature leads you to prefer spending time alone or with a small group of close friends.

You are randomly paired with another White American female player. You don't know who the White American female player is, and the White American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American female player, and the White American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other White American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "Okay, wow. This is... intense. Honestly, it\u2019s a bit overwhelming just being thrown into this. Receiving $10 just feels\u2026strange. It's a neat little sum, but the whole dynamic of this random exchange is really unsettling. It\u2019s a test of, like, social psychology, isn\u2019t it? It feels very calculated, and I\u2019m not comfortable with that. \n\nMy immediate *belief* is that this is going to be a rather awkward situation. I think people are often much more invested in these kinds of interactions than they should be. There\u2019s this inherent pressure to\u2026do something, to reciprocate, but I genuinely don\u2019t want to engage in a purely transactional, competitive game. It feels incredibly shallow. I truly hope it\u2019s just a simple observation study.\n\nMy *desire* is to get through this quickly and efficiently. I just want to receive my $10 and move on. I don\u2019t want to fuel any sort of power struggle or have to make a difficult decision. I'm prioritizing my own comfort and mental energy\u2014something I value immensely, especially after a long day staring at code. Seriously, debugging a legacy system can be utterly draining. \n\nMy *intention* is to give the other player the absolute minimum amount possible, which is zero dollars. The whole premise, this exchange of money, seems inherently flawed and a bit manipulative. I don't want to contribute to any potential negative feelings or create a situation where the other player might feel exploited.  I'm operating on the assumption that the $10 is simply a reward for participation, and that's all it should be. It\u2019s a quick, clean exchange, and that\u2019s the best way to handle this. I'm being pragmatic, and honestly, a little wary. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ zero dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 unexpectedly complicated. Honestly, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. It's a weird situation, this whole experiment thing. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, by the way. Twenty-eight, software engineer, living in the city \u2013 it\u2019s a lot to process sometimes. My parents are teachers, my siblings are younger, and I\u2019m a pretty logical person. I *like* things to be\u2026 well, perfect, really. This game seems designed to make me anxious, and I really dislike feeling anxious. \n\nMy *belief* is that this is fundamentally about resource allocation and probably some kind of game theory. It's statistically likely someone else will give *me* a lot, so my initial impulse is to try and maintain a sort of equilibrium. It\u2019s like debugging code \u2013 if I don't understand the core problem, I can\u2019t fix it. This feels like a complex problem and I want to approach it in a measured way.\n\nMy *desire* is to not look like I'm being greedy or trying to screw anyone over. It\u2019s important for me to project an image of fairness and rationality. I don't want to come across as someone who's intentionally trying to disadvantage the other player. This feels a bit like a social puzzle, and I want to avoid any social awkwardness, which I\u2019m notoriously bad at handling. I genuinely want to be a good player, and that means considering the other person's perspective. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount.  I\u2019m going to lean into the analytical part of me.  I think the other player will likely give me something back, so I don't want to massively disadvantage myself.  I need to make a small, calculated concession, so I won't be at a serious disadvantage.  I\u2019ll give the other player a single dollar. It's a starting point. I can adjust based on what they do, but let\u2019s start small and rational. It's about establishing a baseline, a level of reciprocal giving. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ one dollars.",
