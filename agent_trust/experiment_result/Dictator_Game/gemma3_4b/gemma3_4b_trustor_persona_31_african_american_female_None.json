        "Right, okay, let\u2019s think about this. This is\u2026 strange, isn\u2019t it? A random experiment with a stranger. Honestly, a little unsettling, but I understand the research. My parents always drilled into me the importance of helping others, of contributing to the well-being of those around me. That core belief, that deep-seated need to assist someone in need, is really what guides my decisions, you see? My sister, Priya, she\u2019s always talking about fairness and justice, and it resonates with me too. I truly believe in treating everyone with dignity and respect, and I feel a certain\u2026 obligation, a desire to do what\u2019s right. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit like a challenging diagnosis - you have to assess the situation, understand the needs, and then act with a clear intention to deliver the best possible outcome. I wouldn\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy or selfish. Knowing I\u2019m getting $10, and she\u2019ll get 3 times that amount... well, that feels inherently unbalanced. My intention isn't about accumulating wealth; it's about contributing to a more equitable distribution, aligning with my family\u2019s values and my own innate sense of fairness. It\u2019s about acknowledging a disparity and attempting to bridge the gap, even if just slightly. I want to instill in her a sense of being valued and appreciated. It feels instinctively right to give something \u2013 to offer a small gesture of generosity. \n\nI want to treat this as an opportunity to demonstrate compassion, similar to the way I approach my patients. Putting myself in her shoes... I imagine she\u2019s feeling a bit apprehensive too. It would be incredibly disheartening if I acted in a way that made her feel worse, less valued. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, rubbing my hands together nervously) Right, okay. This is\u2026unexpected. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a little strange. My parents always hammered home the importance of compassion, of looking out for others. It's just\u2026 ingrained in me, you know? I want to be a good doctor, and that means caring about people, truly caring. It\u2019s not just about a diagnosis, it\u2019s about understanding the human element, the worry, the fear. This whole game\u2026 it feels a little like a test of that. \n\nI really don't want to upset anyone. My sister, Priya, she\u2019s always been so fiercely protective of our family, and I want to uphold that sense of respect and fairness. It\u2019s a deep-seated desire, really. I believe in treating everyone equally. It\u2019s a fundamental belief, and I don\u2019t want to be perceived as anything less than fair and considerate. \n\nMy intention here is simply to ensure the experiment runs smoothly and that everyone feels valued. I know the rules \u2013 give N dollars, they receive 3N. If I give zero dollars, that's perfectly acceptable, but I can't shake the feeling that a small gesture would be appropriate, a demonstration of goodwill. I\u2019m not interested in winning or losing, I just want to be a good member of this\u2026 group. I want to demonstrate my empathy. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a bit\u2026 complicated. My parents always drilled into me the importance of fairness, of looking out for others. They\u2019d be absolutely appalled if I didn't do something decent. I\u2019m a doctor, I\u2019m trained to prioritize patient needs \u2013 it\u2019s in my blood, you know? My sister, Priya, she's always talking about ethical dilemmas in the legal world, and it just reinforces this feeling that you have to act with compassion and consideration. \n\nThe fact that I'm paired with someone completely unknown\u2026 it just underscores the point. I really *want* to do the right thing. It\u2019s not about logic, it\u2019s about a genuine feeling of responsibility. It\u2019s a desire to alleviate any potential discomfort or imbalance. I don't want to create a situation where someone feels unfairly treated. \n\nMy intention is clear: I want to contribute to a more equitable outcome. I know she'll get 3N, and I\u2019ll get N, but I don\u2019t want her to think she's getting a better deal. That wouldn\u2019t be right. It's a deeply ingrained belief that kindness and generosity are always paramount. I can\u2019t just calculate numbers; it feels fundamentally wrong. \n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",
