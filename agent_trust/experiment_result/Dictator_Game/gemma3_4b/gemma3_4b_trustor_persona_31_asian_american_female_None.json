        "Right, let\u2019s think about this carefully. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a little\u2026 odd, but I understand the point. It\u2019s about cooperation, isn\u2019t it? And I *do* want to be a good participant. My parents always drilled into me the importance of community and helping others, especially those in need. It\u2019s deeply ingrained in my being, this desire to support people. I don\u2019t want to create any friction, and frankly, I find the idea of a potential power imbalance unsettling. \n\nMy *belief* is that a little generosity, a small gesture of kindness, can often smooth things over. It's about showing respect and recognizing the value of another person\u2019s perspective. I *desire* a harmonious interaction; I genuinely want to build a positive relationship with this other person. I can see myself, my sister, happily collaborating and assisting someone in need.\n\nMy *intention* is to reciprocate, to establish a foundation of goodwill.  If I give a substantial amount, it could inadvertently create an expectation. But if I give a small amount, it feels too transactional. I\u2019m aiming for something that feels genuinely supportive, without creating any imbalance. It's about demonstrating empathy. \n\nConsidering all of this, I\u2019m going to give 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. It\u2019s a bit perplexing, isn\u2019t it? This experiment... they're asking us to really consider fairness and generosity. Honestly, it feels a little strange, this whole system of giving and receiving. My parents always drummed into me the importance of *dharma*, of fulfilling your duty and helping those in need. It's a core part of who I am, you know? I can\u2019t just stand by and let someone else get a significant advantage. \n\nMy *desire* is to act with integrity and kindness. It's a natural response, driven by empathy. I want to ensure the other player isn't disadvantaged.  I believe in treating everyone with respect and understanding. This experiment highlights the potential imbalances, and I want to correct that immediately.\n\nMy *intention* is to counteract the asymmetry of the exchange, giving the other person enough to truly benefit.  The system says she gets 3N, so I need to give enough to level the playing field. I'm going to think carefully about what a fair approach would be. It\u2019s a complicated situation - the money is just a tool, a means to an end. What matters is the spirit of the interaction, a genuine gesture of goodwill. It's a test of character, in a way.  I feel a responsibility to act in a way that aligns with my values. I really want to ensure that the other player doesn't feel exploited.  I need to give her something that makes her feel like she's being treated fairly. \n\nI\u2019m going to aim for a generous, but not disproportionate, contribution. Let\u2019s say... \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a little\u2026 unusual. My parents would absolutely be having a fit if they knew I was involved in something like this, especially with this money exchange thing. They've always instilled in me such a strong sense of fairness and responsibility. It\u2019s not just about earning money, it\u2019s about treating people with respect and ensuring things are balanced. I can sense this other player is also trying to figure out the best strategy. \n\nMy *belief* is that this isn't a trick, but a genuine attempt to understand how people react to these kinds of scenarios. I truly believe everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, and I want to act in a way that reflects my values. \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute to a positive outcome for both of us. I don't want to be seen as exploiting the situation or taking advantage of someone. It feels instinctively wrong to just hoard the money. The idea of potentially upsetting someone, especially a fellow Asian individual \u2013 it clashes with everything I hold dear. My sister would be livid if she heard I was being greedy! \n\nMy *intention* is to give the other player a fair share. It feels right to reciprocate and demonstrate goodwill. I want to build a sense of trust, even in this slightly bizarre setting. I\u2019m going to base my decision on what would feel most compassionate and reasonable. Let\u2019s be honest, if I only gave a small amount, it could feel like I was trying to get ahead, and that just isn\u2019t my style. \n\nI\u2019m going to aim for a balance, something that feels generous and supportive, but also acknowledges the power dynamic. Considering the principle of fairness, I'll give... 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",
