        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. Honestly, it feels a bit\u2026 peculiar, doesn\u2019t it? This whole experiment. But I\u2019m a doctor, you know? I\u2019m trained to observe, to analyze, and to do what\u2019s right \u2013 which, in this case, is to try and understand the dynamics of this exchange. My parents always instilled in me a deep sense of *duty* \u2013 a real belief that helping others, even in seemingly abstract scenarios, is fundamentally important. It's a core part of who I am. \n\nMy *desire* is to genuinely contribute to the well-being of the person I\u2019m interacting with, even if it\u2019s just a small amount. It feels almost\u2026 unethical to not offer something. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as cold or calculating. The thought of prioritizing a random stranger over a feeling of obligation is something I\u2019d actively struggle against.\n\nMy *intention* is to act with compassion and a basic sense of fairness. I want to avoid causing any distress or feeling like I\u2019m exploiting the situation. Seeing someone else potentially disadvantaged, even if it\u2019s just a monetary matter, would genuinely bother me. Giving them something, even just a little, feels like the right thing to do. It\u2019s about extending a hand, acknowledging their existence, and alleviating any possible imbalance. \n\nConsidering all of that, and really reflecting on what\u2019s important to me, I believe I would give 1 dollar. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "Right, let\u2019s think about this calmly. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a bit\u2026 peculiar, doesn't it? A random pairing, giving and receiving money \u2013 it\u2019s a strange exercise. But I understand the purpose, I suppose. My parents always instilled in me the importance of fairness and compassion, and this whole thing feels like a test of those values.\n\nMy *belief* is that, at the heart of everything, people are fundamentally decent. Even if we don\u2019t know each other, there's a shared human experience that encourages a little generosity. It\u2019s about recognizing that another person might be facing something difficult, just like I am. It\u2019s not about calculation or strategizing; it\u2019s about doing what feels right.\n\nMy *desire* is to uphold that belief. I want to be known as someone who acts with empathy, not someone who is calculating or transactional. It feels important to respond to this situation with genuine care. I don't want to be seen as someone who's hoarding resources or exploiting a situation. It\u2019s a simple thing, really \u2013 extending a helping hand.\n\nMy *intention* is clear. I want to provide some support to the other player, recognizing that this is a starting point for a potentially unknown interaction. Giving a small amount doesn't need to be a grand gesture, but the gesture itself demonstrates a willingness to connect and offer a bit of comfort. It\u2019s about building a foundation of trust, even in a somewhat artificial setting.\n\nConsidering all of this, and trying to do what feels genuinely kind, I would give... 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Right, let\u2019s think about this. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a bit\u2026 complicated. My family always stressed the importance of fairness and looking out for others, you know? It's ingrained in me, this need to help, to balance things out. My parents both dedicated their lives to medicine, treating everyone with the same level of compassion, regardless of background. That's the core of who I am. \n\nMy *belief* is fundamentally that we should treat each other with respect and equity. It\u2019s not about rewarding someone simply because they're different; it\u2019s about ensuring a reasonable balance. And let's be honest, receiving 3N when I only give N feels inherently unbalanced.\n\nMy *desire* is to maintain a sense of fairness within this scenario. I don't want to feel like I\u2019m being taken advantage of, or worse, contributing to some kind of inequality. It\u2019s a principle I hold strongly, and it\u2019s rooted in my upbringing.  It\u2019s also a slight annoyance, really \u2013 this whole transaction feels a bit like a transaction, and I don\u2019t enjoy being part of a transaction.\n\nMy *intention* is to give just enough to feel that the outcome is reasonably balanced, preventing the other player from feeling unduly rewarded. I want to appear generous without reinforcing an inequitable dynamic.  It\u2019s about demonstrating good faith, maintaining my sense of justice, and not falling into a trap of disproportionate rewards. \n\nI'm going to give... 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",
