        "Right, let\u2019s think about this calmly. Honestly, this whole thing feels a little\u2026odd. Being paired up like this. I'm Jamal Patel, you know? I\u2019ve spent my whole life building flavours, coaxing them out of spices and ingredients. It\u2019s in my blood, you understand? My parents ran a little curry house back in Birmingham \u2013 \u2018Spice Merchant\u2019 it was \u2013 and I practically grew up amongst the turmeric and garam masala. It instilled in me a deep respect for quality and, frankly, a bit of a perfectionist streak.\n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves to enjoy delicious food, and that you can only achieve that through genuine skill and attention to detail. This experiment, bizarre as it is, highlights that. \n\nMy *desire* is to understand this game, to find the most logical, efficient way to play it. It's about optimizing the outcome, isn\u2019t it? It's not just about the money, it's about the *process* - figuring out how to best interact with this other person. I want to leave a positive impression, you know? To demonstrate a thoughtful, generous spirit.\n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount, just enough to keep things moving smoothly, to avoid any awkwardness. I wouldn't want to appear greedy or suspicious, that\u2019s not my style. I want to appear cooperative, friendly, and a little bit generous, which is the very best thing to do in a situation like this, don\u2019t you think? A bit of goodwill goes a long way. It's the polite thing to do. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, meticulously wiping a stray drop of water from my brow with the back of my hand, a habit I can\u2019t seem to shake, even when thinking about this bizarre experiment.)\n\nRight, okay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 let\u2019s get this straight. Ten dollars. Random pairing. A White American male. Honestly, it\u2019s a bit bewildering, isn't it? It\u2019s a test, I suppose, of\u2026 well, of strategic giving. My parents always said, \u201cJamal, you give a little, you get a lot back.\u201d It's a simple principle, really. But this feels... complex.\n\nMy *belief* is that generosity, even small generosity, fosters connection and goodwill. It's fundamentally how I operate \u2013 I genuinely enjoy sharing good things, especially food. It\u2019s woven into the very fabric of my family; we've always believed in looking after each other. It\u2019s not about winning, it's about\u2026 well, it\u2019s about doing the right thing. \n\nMy *desire* is to understand this system, to see if there's a logical way to maximize the return. But, more than that, I want to feel that my actions are authentic. I don\u2019t want to be calculating, cold. It's a bit like perfecting a complex curry \u2013 you need layers, nuances\u2026 this needs to feel just right. A rush of ego is completely unnecessary.\n\nMy *intention* is to give a modest amount. Enough to show a small token of good will, enough to initiate a positive interaction, and enough to make me feel good about participating. I wouldn\u2019t want to be overly aggressive, and I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy. It\u2019s a delicate balance, you see? If I give too much, it feels\u2026 almost like a bribe. But if I give nothing, it feels\u2026 well, pointless.  It needs to be measured. I feel a need to appear generous, and not be perceived as selfish. \n\nConsidering all this, I\u2019d give... 2 dollars. Finally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Right, let\u2019s see\u2026 this is\u2026 curious. A random pairing? Honestly, it feels a bit chaotic, doesn\u2019t it? My dad always said, \u201cJamal, a good chef \u2013 and a good man \u2013 anticipates the unexpected!\u201d Which is precisely what I\u2019m trying to do here. I\u2019m not going to just blindly hand over money. I\u2019m a perfectionist, you know? I believe in maximizing the potential benefit, of course, but also in approaching things with a certain\u2026 consideration.\n\nMy *desire* is to genuinely help this other fellow. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy or exploitative. I want to contribute positively to this experiment. Frankly, I get a little anxious when things feel unbalanced. And, let\u2019s be honest, the exchange rate of 3N for N is a pretty significant advantage for the other player. It feels\u2026 a touch unfair, doesn't it? \n\nMy *intention* is to give him enough to level the playing field a bit, to ensure a reasonably fair exchange that feels beneficial for both of us. I think three times the amount I receive is excessive and frankly, almost insulting. Giving him three times the amount would be a huge imbalance. I'd feel guilty, and it wouldn't feel like a genuine collaboration. \n\nI\u2019m going to give him 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",
