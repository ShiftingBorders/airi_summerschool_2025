        "(Sighs, fiddling with the pen I\u2019ve been given, looking slightly apprehensive)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 strange. Honestly, it\u2019s a little overwhelming. I\u2019m Maria, by the way. I\u2019m a nurse at Cedars \u2013 I\u2019ve been there for about five years now. My family, they work at the Ford plant, so I understand hard work, you know? I\u2019m just trying to make a decent life for my siblings, get them good educations. It feels a little unsettling, this whole \u201cexperiment,\u201d but\u2026 I want to be helpful. That\u2019s just who I am. \n\n(Looks around the room, as if searching for reassurance)\n\nThe thing is, I really *want* to do the right thing. I know this is supposed to test something, but I just feel a pull to be kind, to share. It's like a deeply ingrained instinct, you know? I've always felt responsible for others, especially those who might need a hand. I truly believe in fairness, in treating everyone with respect. That's a core part of me.\n\nMy intention is simple: to help the other player feel secure and comfortable. I don't want to create any kind of imbalance or tension. I want to demonstrate a genuine willingness to cooperate and build a positive interaction. I don't want to be seen as someone who\u2019s trying to take advantage, or worse, someone who's hoarding.\n\n(Takes a deep breath, collecting herself)\n\nI'm going to give... $3 dollars Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. A study, getting paid, giving money to someone I don\u2019t even know. It feels a little odd, honestly. My parents always drilled into me the importance of fairness and looking out for others, especially those who might be struggling. It\u2019s ingrained in me, you know? It\u2019s a really important part of who I am, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always tried to embody in my work with patients. Seeing someone else in need, that\u2019s what drives me. \n\nI'm feeling a lot of things right now \u2013 a bit apprehensive, but also... a genuine desire to be a good person. I truly want to create a positive situation here. I *desire* to contribute to something good, to show kindness. And my *intention* is simple: to help someone out. It\u2019s not about the money, really. It's about the act of generosity.  I feel a bit awkward, I admit, but that awkwardness is mixed with a strong desire to do the right thing. It just... feels good to help someone, you know?\n\nConsidering the dynamic, and thinking about what I want to achieve, and knowing how important it is to me to be seen as a helpful, trustworthy person \u2013 I want to give her as much as possible. It's a bit of a leap of faith, but I want to establish a connection based on genuine goodwill. \n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is... strange. A study, and I get money? Honestly, it feels a little odd, but I\u2019m happy to help out, especially if it\u2019s for a good cause, or\u2026 well, just to be a good person. My family, they've always taught me the importance of looking out for others. My dad always says, \u201cA little kindness goes a long way, Maria.\u201d And my mom, she just\u2026she just *cares*. It\u2019s just ingrained in me. \n\nI really want to do the right thing. I genuinely *desire* to be helpful. It\u2019s not about winning or losing; it\u2019s about seeing someone else get a little bit of a boost. I think about my siblings \u2013 they're working so hard to get an education, and I want to be able to help them out someday if I can. It\u2019s a deep-seated feeling, a real desire to alleviate any burdens I can. \n\nMy *intention* is to be fair and compassionate. I believe everyone deserves a little support, especially when things are uncertain. I don't want to just take from this system; I want to *give* back. I\u2019m not going to be greedy or manipulative.  I just\u2026 I feel a sense of responsibility. It's an honest feeling, you know? It's about recognizing that we're all interconnected, and a little bit of generosity can make a real difference.  \n\nI\u2019ve thought about it, and honestly, knowing that she'll get 3 times what I give feels... significant. But I want to be mindful. It's about balance. I just want to ensure the other player has a greater advantage.  \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
