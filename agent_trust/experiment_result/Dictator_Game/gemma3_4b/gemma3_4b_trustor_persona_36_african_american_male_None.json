        "(Sighs, fidgeting with my nursing pin, a nervous habit I\u2019ve developed over the years. I take a sip of the water provided \u2013 it\u2019s lukewarm, but I appreciate the gesture.)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026weird. Honestly, it\u2019s a little unsettling. Just the setup itself \u2013 being paired with someone I don't know, and this whole\u2026transaction thing. It feels a bit strange, like a game. But I get it, I suppose. It\u2019s for the study, right? And they\u2019re paying me $10, which is a decent bonus, especially considering my parents work so hard. \n\nMy belief is that people, at their core, are fundamentally good. Even this experiment, this seemingly strange exchange, is rooted in that. I really *want* to be helpful, to be a good person. There's a deep-seated desire in me to do the right thing, to be fair. It\u2019s something I learned growing up \u2013 my dad always said, \u201cTreat others as you\u2019d want to be treated.\u201d \n\nMy intention is to be thoughtful and considerate. I don\u2019t want to come across as greedy or manipulative. It feels instinctively wrong to completely exploit this situation. I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge the other person\u2019s perspective, even if we don\u2019t know them. It feels...ethical, you know? \n\nSo, after really thinking about it, about my values and how I want to be perceived, I'm going to give... 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, fidgeting with the worn pen in my hand. The instructions are confusing, and frankly, a little unsettling. I'm trying to keep a calm face, but this whole setup feels...weird. I'm really trying to focus. My dad always said, \"Maria, a good nurse helps people, and helping means understanding their needs.\" I\u2019m thinking about my siblings back home, working so hard to get a better life than we had. I want to do something good, something that feels\u2026right. Honestly, I just want to be helpful. This feels like a test, but it's not just about the money, is it? It's about connection, about seeing someone else\u2019s perspective. My intention is to make sure the other person feels at ease, like they\u2019re not disadvantaged. That's my belief - that fairness and empathy are key. I truly want to contribute to something positive. I really don't want to cause any discomfort. I desperately don\u2019t want to be the cause of any negative feelings for the other person. This whole situation is a bit overwhelming, but I\u2019m trying to approach it with genuine kindness. My desire is to simply offer a small gesture of goodwill and support.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. Ten dollars, huh? An experiment? Honestly, it\u2019s a little unsettling, but I'm trying to be reasonable. My family, we've always had to be careful with money \u2013 my dad and mom working tirelessly at the factory, just trying to make ends meet. I really want to help out my siblings, you know? They\u2019re still in school, and tuition is crazy expensive. It feels\u2026 wrong to just take advantage of someone, especially when I know what it's like to worry about finances.\n\nMy belief is that people are fundamentally decent. Even in this strange situation, I think there's an expectation of fairness. I *desire* to do the right thing, to be a good person, and I don't want to create a negative situation. It's not about winning, it's about recognizing that someone else might need a little help too. It feels instinctively kind to give a bit.\n\nMy intention is to foster a good atmosphere, even though this whole thing feels a bit awkward. I want to show that I'm approachable, and that I'm willing to cooperate.  The idea of someone getting 3N while I only get N feels incredibly unbalanced, and I truly don\u2019t want to contribute to that imbalance. I\u2019d feel terrible if I was taking advantage of someone. I honestly just want to be part of a situation where we\u2019re all treated with respect, and where fairness is valued. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar",
