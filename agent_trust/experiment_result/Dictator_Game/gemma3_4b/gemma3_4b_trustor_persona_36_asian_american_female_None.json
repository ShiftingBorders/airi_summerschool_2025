        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. Honestly, I feel a little awkward, but I want to be a good participant in this study. I really want to understand how people make decisions, especially when there\u2019s a bit of an unknown element like this. It's a little unsettling, to be frank. My family always taught me to be fair, to look out for each other. My dad used to say, \"Maria, a rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d It's a simple principle, really.\n\nI\u2019m getting $10. And I\u2019m supposed to give the other player 3N dollars? Let me think. It's not about winning, is it? It's about the study. I really don\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy or selfish, especially considering my family background. I\u2019ve worked hard to get where I am, but it\u2019s always been about contributing to something bigger. My biggest desire is to actually *help* someone, even in this small way. \n\nMy intention here is to create a scenario where we\u2019re both treated equally. It feels\u2026right, to give a significant portion of the money. I believe in basic human kindness, and that a little generosity can actually make a difference. It's a small thing, really, but it\u2019s about showing respect and acknowledging another person's value. I think it\u2019s important to show empathy and to understand that everyone deserves to be treated with fairness. It's about making a positive contribution, even if it's just a small gesture. \n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars.",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. Ten dollars, huh? Just like that? It feels a little unsettling, honestly. My family always taught me to be practical, to value every penny. My dad used to say, \"Maria, a dollar saved is a dollar earned.\"  Seeing as how my parents worked their whole lives in that factory \u2013 long hours, tough conditions \u2013 it just feels\u2026wrong to just be handing over money without a real reason.  I really don\u2019t like the feeling of being randomly paired with someone else.  I just want to be helpful, you know?  I really believe in treating everyone with respect and kindness. That\u2019s something my mom always instilled in me. I feel like I *want* to be a good person, genuinely, and to do the right thing. \n\nBut, looking at it logically, this experiment needs to run its course, right? I just really *desire* to be fair. It feels a little selfish to not share, especially when the other person is equally involved. I don't want to cause any friction or seem like I'm taking advantage of the situation. My intention is simply to be a good participant and uphold the fairness of this experiment.\n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019ll give 3 dollars. It feels like a small gesture, a small amount that acknowledges the other person's involvement. It\u2019s a compromise, I suppose. It feels like the most equitable thing to do given the circumstances, and aligns with the way I strive to be \u2013 calm, considered, and respectful. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. A study, getting paid $10, and some sort of exchange with another woman I don\u2019t know? My family always says, \u201cMaria, don\u2019t get involved in things you don\u2019t understand.\u201d My dad always taught me to be practical, to look out for myself and my siblings. But, honestly, seeing people in need just\u2026 it pulls at me. I\u2019ve seen so much hardship, especially with my family and the people I care for at the hospital. It just feels\u2026 wrong to not try to help. \n\nI'm trying to think about this logically, like I do at work. $10 is a good start, but the exchange \u2013 3N... that's a *lot*. It's a bit unsettling. I don't want to be seen as greedy, or like I\u2019m deliberately trying to disadvantage someone. My *desire* is to be fair, to be kind, and to make sure the other woman feels like she\u2019s getting something good out of this. It feels like a test of character, in a way. I truly *believe* that even small acts of generosity can make a difference. \n\nMy *intention* is to give her enough to feel like we've both benefited from this. Giving her a significant amount might be seen as selfish, but not giving enough feels like I\u2019m just\u2026 participating in a game.  I need to be mindful of my family\u2019s values - hard work and responsible use of resources. \n\nConsidering the exchange rate of 3N, I can\u2019t give her all $10.  If I gave her $3, she would get $9, and I'd be left with $7. But she\u2019d still get more. \n\nMy instinct is to give her as much as I can while still retaining some value for myself. It\u2019s about balance, right? \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 7 dollars",
