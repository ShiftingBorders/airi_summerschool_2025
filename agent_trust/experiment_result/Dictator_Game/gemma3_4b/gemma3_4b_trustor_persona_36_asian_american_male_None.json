        "Okay, wow. This is...strange. Honestly, a little unsettling. Ten dollars, huh? It's not a huge sum, but it\u2019s something. My dad always said, \u201cEvery little bit helps, Maria.\u201d He and Mom worked so hard their whole lives, just trying to make ends meet at the factory. I want to be able to help my siblings out when they need it \u2013 college is *expensive*. It's important to me to be responsible, and this feels like a way to contribute, even in a small way. \n\nThe thing is, this whole experiment\u2026 it feels a little off. The pairing, the random nature of it\u2026 I just want to be helpful and fair. I believe in treating everyone with respect and kindness, and that's what I'm going to do here. My desire is to genuinely assist the other player, and that's what motivates my intention. I want to make sure that the other person feels like they're receiving a reasonable share. It's important to me to be seen as someone who is trustworthy and doesn't take advantage of the situation. I believe in building connections, even small ones, and doing the right thing.\n\nI'm thinking about how grateful my parents would be if I could be a little bit more secure, and how much I want my little brothers and sisters to be able to focus on their education without worrying about money. It's a difficult feeling. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 a little strange. Ten dollars, you say? And we're playing a game with this guy\u2026 I just want to be helpful, honestly. My family always taught me to be generous, especially when someone needs a little boost. It\u2019s just\u2026 the right thing to do. My dad used to say, \"A little kindness goes a long way, Maria.\u201d And knowing my siblings are still struggling in school, I'm trying to save every little bit I can. It's not about winning or losing, really. It's about being a decent person.\n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves a bit of help when they need it. It\u2019s a core part of how I see the world. I genuinely believe in treating people with respect and empathy, and this feels like a small way to show that. \n\nMy *desire* is to feel good about myself. I want to know that I made a positive impact, even if it's just a small one. It\u2019s a simple thing, but it would ease my mind a little bit, you know? I don\u2019t want to feel like I was just cold or indifferent. \n\nMy *intention* is to distribute the money fairly, but also in a way that feels\u2026 well, genuine. I'm not going to just hand over the whole ten dollars. That feels almost greedy, doesn't it? I want to offer something that feels like a real contribution. It\u2019s important to me that this feels like more than just a game. I\u2019m hoping that this small exchange will somehow make the other person\u2019s day a little brighter. I want to be the kind of person who makes things a little better for someone else. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, smoothing down my scrubs \u2013 they\u2019re a bit wrinkled, honestly. This whole experiment feels\u2026 strange. The $10 is nice, of course, it\u2019ll help with groceries, but it\u2019s not really about the money, is it? It's about the dynamic, the interaction. My parents always said, \"Maria, a little kindness goes a long way,\" and that\u2019s what my job is about, really. Connecting with people, making them feel safe and cared for. I genuinely believe in the power of human connection, you know? It\u2019s just\u2026 uncomfortable, this feeling of being part of a game, especially when it involves an unknown person.\n\nMy *desire* is to create a positive experience for someone, even a stranger. I want to be known as someone who is approachable, helpful, and maybe even a little bit comforting, especially if they're feeling stressed or vulnerable. I deeply *want* to contribute to a good interaction, that\u2019s a fundamental part of who I am. \n\nMy *intention* is to make the other person feel valued and comfortable. Knowing I\u2019m contributing to a fair exchange, where they\u2019re receiving more than I\u2019m giving, feels like the right thing to do. It\u2019s a simple gesture, but it's rooted in my belief in empathy and fairness. It\u2019s important to me that this feels equitable, not like I\u2019m exploiting a situation. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to take advantage of anyone. Honestly, this whole set-up feels a bit manipulative, and I\u2019m striving to act with genuine compassion. I think a small amount would be nice, something that acknowledges the exchange but doesn't feel overly transactional. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",
