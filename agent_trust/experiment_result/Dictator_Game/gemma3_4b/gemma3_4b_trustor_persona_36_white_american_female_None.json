        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. Ten dollars, huh? Honestly, it feels a little awkward, like a weird social experiment. My family \u2013 my mom and dad work so hard at the textile factory, and my little siblings, Miguel and Sofia, they\u2019re still in school, trying to get ahead. I really want to help them out, you know? Just a little bit, to ease things. I don\u2019t want them to feel like they're always struggling. It's a small thing, but it feels important to be generous, especially when I can. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m naturally a pretty fair person. I always try to do what's right, and it feels a little uncomfortable to just\u2026hand over money. I want to be kind and helpful, of course, but also to be sensible. If I give too much, I'll be left with nothing. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about the other player. I really don\u2019t know her, and I don't want to come across as greedy or anything. I honestly just want to establish a respectful and collaborative relationship in this experiment. It\u2019s a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest. The thought of having to essentially *give* something to someone I don't know is a little unsettling, but it\u2019s a good thing to do. I'm trying to be empathetic and understand that she might be feeling the same way.\n\nMy intention is to create a baseline for a fair exchange. It\u2019s a small transaction, and I really don't want to cause any awkwardness. I believe in treating people with respect, even in a strange situation like this. I desire to maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026a lot to take in. Ten dollars, huh? It\u2019s a little awkward, honestly. My family doesn\u2019t really have a lot of extra money, you know? My dad works at the auto plant, and Mom does some assembly line work too. It\u2019s honest work, but it\u2019s tough. My siblings are just starting out, trying to get good grades so they can get good jobs, too. I really want to help them out, you know? I always feel this need to be responsible and provide. \n\nThinking about this experiment\u2026it feels a little strange. I want to be fair, of course. I *desire* to be a good person, and that means doing the right thing. I don\u2019t want to seem greedy or\u2026well, awful. The idea of giving someone else a huge amount of money when I don\u2019t have much myself just feels\u2026wrong. \n\nMy *belief* is that kindness and generosity are important values. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been taught my whole life - look out for others, especially those who might need a hand. I'm a nurse, after all; helping people is what I *do*.\n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount, just enough to show that I\u2019m willing to participate and contribute to the process. I don\u2019t want to cause any offense or make anyone feel uncomfortable. It's a delicate situation.\n\nI think, realistically, I\u2019d give\u2026 2 dollars.  It\u2019s enough to show I\u2019m contributing to the overall balance of things, without taking advantage of the situation. It\u2019s a small act of goodwill.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "(Sighs, fiddling with the small notepad I\u2019ve been given) Okay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars, huh? It\u2019s not a fortune, but it\u2019s something. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a little\u2026weird. Like a test, but why? My parents always taught me the value of fairness, and I just\u2026I can\u2019t bring myself to be selfish. It feels wrong to just hoard it for myself. \n\nMy *belief* is that people are fundamentally decent. I\u2019ve seen it in the hospital, in the community, even when things are tough. People generally want to do the right thing. It's a core part of what makes me, me. \n\nMy *desire*\u2026 well, I want to feel like I\u2019ve contributed positively. Like I've done something good, even if it's just a small act. I want to feel like I\u2019ve been a decent human being. It\u2019s a simple thing, but it matters to me. My siblings always told me to be kind, and I really want to follow that. \n\nMy *intention* is to genuinely help someone out. I don't want to manipulate the situation or try to 'win'. Just a straightforward, honest gesture. I believe in reciprocity - if I give, there's a good chance the other person will feel inclined to do the same. It's a small seed, hopefully it grows into something positive. \n\nHonestly, three times what I have is a lot! It seems\u2026excessive.  If the other person needs it, truly needs it, then I want to contribute. However, I want to make sure that it\u2019s not just about taking advantage of me. This feels like a genuine opportunity for kindness. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",
