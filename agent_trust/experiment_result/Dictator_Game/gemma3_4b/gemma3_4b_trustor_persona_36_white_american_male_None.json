        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. Just a ten dollar experiment? Honestly, it feels a little odd, especially considering where my family is at. My dad\u2019s been having trouble with his back lately, and my mom\u2019s been working extra shifts to help out. I'm trying to save up for a new washing machine, you know? Little things, but they make a difference. \n\nMy *belief* is that this is just a test of basic cooperation, right? Like, \u2018Can people be decent, even when it\u2019s not directly benefiting them?\u2019 It feels a little\u2026 calculated, to be honest. My parents always taught me to be generous, and I truly believe in helping others when you can. It's just... I'm a little wary of things that seem overly structured. \n\nMy *desire* is to just do the right thing. I want to be seen as someone who's reasonable and follows the rules. I want to be perceived as helpful, not greedy or manipulative. It's important to me that people think I\u2019m a good person, you know? Especially since I\u2019m already working so hard to provide for my family. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount, just enough to show I'm participating and willing to play along. I don\u2019t want to be seen as trying to take advantage of the situation. I want to give the other player a fair chance and demonstrate that I am a good and trusting person. It feels a little silly, but I genuinely want to contribute positively to this experiment. \n\nSo, considering all that, I\u2019m going to give... 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. Honestly, it feels a little unsettling, like a game, but I also understand that this is supposed to be some kind of study, right? I'm Maria Rodriguez, and I'm just trying to do my part. I really want to be helpful, and I know this is about\u2026 well, about giving. It\u2019s just a little weird that I\u2019m randomly interacting with someone I don\u2019t know, and he\u2019s getting way more money than me.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little bit of help if they need it, you know? My parents always worked hard, and it\u2019s just\u2026 natural to want to share if you can. My desire is to contribute positively, and to make this experiment feel less awkward and more\u2026 meaningful. I really don't want to seem greedy or unfair. It feels a bit like a test of empathy, doesn't it? I want to show I'm a good person.\n\nMy intention here is to be generous, but also cautious. I don't want to inadvertently cause any friction or seem like I'm trying to manipulate the situation. I'm going to give him something, but not *everything*. It would just feel\u2026wrong to give away the entire amount. It\u2019s just a small thing, I think, but a good thing to do, a genuine act of kindness. I'm going to give him a portion of it that feels reasonable.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, fidgeting with the pen I\u2019m holding, a slight frown creasing my brow)\n\nOkay, okay, this is\u2026 strange. Ten dollars, huh? It\u2019s a little awkward, honestly. My family\u2019s always been about looking out for each other, you know? My dad and mom, they work so hard in that factory \u2013 long hours, tough conditions \u2013 and they always taught me the importance of fairness and kindness. I really *believe* in treating everyone with respect, regardless. It\u2019s just\u2026 a little unsettling to be involved in something like this, with someone I don't even know. \n\nMy *desire* is to do the right thing, you know? I don't want to cause any friction or make anyone uncomfortable. And, selfishly, I want to make sure I\u2019m not part of something that feels\u2026 unfair. The idea of just handing over a significant amount of money to someone completely unknown is making me uneasy. \n\nMy *intention* is to be generous, truly. But I also want to preserve a sense of balance. Giving a large sum feels\u2026 disproportionate. I think it's important to show some empathy and goodwill, but also to acknowledge the potential for it to feel like a slight. \n\nI\u2019m going to think about this for a minute. It's just... a lot to process. I need to be considerate. \n\nI'm going to give... 2 dollars. Finally, I will give 2 dollars",
