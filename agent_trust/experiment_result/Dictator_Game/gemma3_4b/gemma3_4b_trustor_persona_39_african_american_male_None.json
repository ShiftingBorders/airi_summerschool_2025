        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. A random pairing? And a game with money? It feels a little awkward, honestly. As a software engineer, I\u2019m used to logical systems, predictable outcomes. This is\u2026 chaotic. But I recognize the potential here \u2013 a genuine test of strategy, and, let's be real, a small reward. \n\nMy initial thought, naturally, is about efficiency. I'm a problem-solver, so I want to optimize this situation. The core belief I\u2019m grappling with is fairness. It feels inherently unfair to be given this scenario, this imbalance. But I also recognize I\u2019m part of a study, and I want to contribute constructively, whatever that might mean. My desire is to not just passively receive, but to actually *do* something intelligent. \n\nMy intention here is to avoid simply giving nothing, that feels passive and wasteful. I want to maximize my gains while still, you know, acting like a decent human being. If I give zero dollars, it just feels...stunted. It feels like I\u2019m not acknowledging the interaction. I want to build some sort of reciprocal system, even if it\u2019s just a small one. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about it like a simple equation: if I give a little, the other person gets a little more. It's not about dominating, it's about finding a balance that feels\u2026reasonable. I\u2019m leaning toward giving 2 dollars. That feels like a sufficient initial gesture, a way to acknowledge the exchange and create a slightly positive loop. It\u2019s a small amount, but it shows I'm willing to participate and contribute. Honestly, I\u2019d feel terrible just accepting the full ten dollars \u2013 that feels greedy, even if it\u2019s technically within the rules. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Honestly, it feels a little strange, like a bizarre game show. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, 30, a software engineer, and I\u2019m being asked to play some sort of financial strategy game with a complete stranger. And to add to the complexity, he\u2019s African American too. It\u2019s a lot to process. \n\nMy initial reaction is definitely a cautious one. I\u2019m a practical person; my parents instilled in me the importance of careful planning and resource allocation. I've always been driven to understand how things work \u2013 algorithms, systems, everything. This feels like a very complex algorithm, and I want to make the best possible decision. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest, there's a small part of me that\u2019s a bit skeptical. I\u2019ve seen enough stories about unequal opportunities and systemic biases to be aware of potential imbalances. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m automatically distrustful, but I *do* want to ensure I\u2019m playing fairly and not inadvertently contributing to any negative outcomes. It\u2019s a responsibility, really.\n\nMy *belief* is that fairness and mutual benefit are essential for any successful interaction. I want to operate under the assumption that this experiment is designed for mutual understanding, not exploitation. I believe in building bridges, not walls. \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute positively to the experiment's outcome, whatever that may be. I want to demonstrate good judgment, strategic thinking, and perhaps even learn something new about how people interact under pressure. I also really want to get that $10! \n\nMy *intention* is to give a relatively small amount of money. I\u2019m going to start with $2. It\u2019s a modest amount, but it\u2019s enough to initiate a reciprocal exchange. If he gives me back something significant, great! If not, I've made a small, calculated contribution, and I haven't risked losing a disproportionate amount. It's a starting point for a beneficial exchange. Honestly, I just want to be perceived as reasonable. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ $2 dollars.",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Honestly, it feels a little weird, like a bizarre social experiment. I'm Sarah Johnson, 30, software engineer, marathon runner \u2013 I pride myself on my logic and my ability to make smart decisions. And now I'm being asked to play a game with someone I don\u2019t know, just to\u2026give them money? \n\nMy *belief* is that this experiment is probably trying to understand how people react under pressure, and maybe even test our inherent biases. I try to be a good person, and a fair one, so I\u2019m assuming it's about something more than just simple self-interest. I really *want* to contribute positively to whatever this is, to show I'm thoughtful and cooperative \u2013 that's a core part of who I am.\n\nMy *desire* is to not mess things up! I\u2019m definitely not someone who likes losing, but more importantly, I don't want to feel like I've exploited someone else, even in a game. It feels\u2026 unethical, in a way. I want to leave this experience feeling like I acted with integrity. \n\nMy *intention* is to find a balance. Giving the other player *nothing* feels like a lost opportunity to build some kind of connection, even if it's just a brief one. Giving *everything* feels completely reckless and, honestly, a little exploitative. I\u2019m aiming for a strategy that feels both fair and strategic, while aligning with my core values.  I'm going to lean towards a number that feels generous without completely depleting my resources. Considering the 3N ratio, giving away a significant amount could really mess me up.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about it like this: if I give them $3, they\u2019ll get $9. That\u2019s a good start.  It seems like a reasonable number to give initially, representing a small gesture of goodwill. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars.",
