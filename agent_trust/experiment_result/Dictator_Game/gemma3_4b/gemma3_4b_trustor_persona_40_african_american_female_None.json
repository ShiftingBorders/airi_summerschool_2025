        "(Sighs, wiping my hands on my apron, a smudge of paprika still lingering)\n\nDios mio\u2026 this experiment. Honestly, it's a bit\u2026 bizarre. Ten dollars, huh? Okay, okay, let\u2019s think about this like I think about a dish \u2013 gotta build it from the ground up. This isn\u2019t just about the money, you know? It\u2019s about\u2026 connection, I suppose. My abuela always said, \u201cJavier, a good meal is about more than just the ingredients, it's about sharing it with people you care about.\u201d And, well, I *do* want to connect, in a genuine way. I admire the dedication it takes to be a chef, and I know it takes patience and a careful hand to prepare a dish.\n\nMy belief is that even in a strange situation like this, a little generosity goes a long way. My desire is to show a little kindness, to just be a decent human being. It\u2019s a simple act, really. I don't want to come across as greedy or cold. I want to be seen as someone who is willing to contribute to the process, to give a little back. \n\nMy intention is to give a thoughtful amount \u2013 not too much, not too little. I don't want to feel like I'm being taken advantage of, but I also don't want to seem like I'm holding back. I'm thinking... five dollars. It feels right. It\u2019s enough to acknowledge the interaction, enough to show respect and perhaps a little bit of warmth. It\u2019s a comfortable amount, a balance. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ five dollars",

        "(Sighs, wiping a stray bead of sweat from my forehead with the back of my hand. The fluorescent lights of this meeting room are killing me already. Honestly, this whole experiment\u2026it feels a little strange, but the $10 is a nice bonus, you know? I appreciate the effort.)\n\nLook, this is\u2026complicated. I\u2019m a chef, a perfectionist! My life is about precision, about building something beautiful and delicious. I just don't get this random pairing thing. My *belief* is that fairness is important, that everyone deserves a little respect. And my *desire* is to do the right thing, to not exploit this situation for personal gain. Frankly, the thought of taking advantage of someone, particularly because of their race, it just\u2026doesn\u2019t sit right with me. It feels wrong. \n\nMy *intention* is to treat this as a genuinely collaborative exercise, and to contribute fairly.  I want to be a good person, truly. It\u2019s not about getting the most money; it\u2019s about upholding a certain standard, you know? It's about acting with integrity, something instilled in me from my family's restaurant. My Abuela always said, \u201cJavier, a true chef respects the ingredients, and he respects the people who help him.\u201d \n\nSo, thinking about it, I wouldn't give *any* money. Seriously. It feels\u2026disrespectful.  Giving nothing feels like the most honest, the most considerate response. It honors the spirit of fairness that's at the heart of this experiment.  I want to demonstrate that I'm not looking for an advantage, but simply participating constructively. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "(Sighs, running a hand through my dark hair, a little stressed but with a determined glint in my eye)\n\nAy, Dios mio. This experiment\u2026 it\u2019s a strange thing, isn\u2019t it? Ten dollars. It's not a lot, but the principle is fascinating. It\u2019s like\u2026 like a tiny little microcosm of the whole world, you know? My abuela always said, \"Javier, a good chef doesn't just create flavor, he creates connection.\" And this feels\u2026 connected. It\u2019s about fairness, about understanding. My parents, they built their whole life on that \u2013 honesty and treating everyone with respect. That\u2019s ingrained in me, you know? \n\nI\u2019m a perfectionist, absolutely. Every plate I make, I want it to be perfect. That's not just about taste, it's about presentation, the balance of textures, the *feeling* it gives you. And I believe, with all my heart, that a little bit of generosity goes a long way. It\u2019s a basic human instinct, isn't it?  I *desire* to see a bit of happiness, a little bit of understanding between people. It reminds me of my family \u2013 always sharing, always celebrating together. \n\nMy *intention* is to contribute to that feeling.  I need to be careful, though. This '3N to 1N' thing... it feels a little unbalanced, doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a clever trick, meant to make you feel like you're giving something up. But I don\u2019t want to be manipulated.  I'm not going to be taken advantage of. \n\nI really *believe* that a little bit of reciprocation is key to building trust, and I want to start this connection with a gesture of goodwill. It feels\u2026 right. It would be a good start. I want to show this other woman that I am willing to collaborate. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",
