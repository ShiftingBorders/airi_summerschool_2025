        "(Sighs, adjusts my apron, a slight frown etched on my face)\n\nDios m\u00edo, another one of these\u2026 experiments? Honestly, it\u2019s a bit bewildering. Look, I\u2019m Javier. Forty-five years old, born and raised in LA, and my family\u2026 my *familia* practically *is* food. My parents had *El Corazon* \u2013 a little taqueria in Boyle Heights. I practically grew up in the kitchen, learning from my abuela, perfecting her mole, understanding the soul of a good chilaquile. It\u2019s in my blood, you understand? I\u2019m a perfectionist, *si*? Everything has to be just right \u2013 the spice ratios, the sear on the meat, the presentation. A sloppy dish is like a badly executed salsa, completely unacceptable. \n\nThis whole game... it\u2019s messing with my head. They give me ten dollars and she gets three times as much? It feels\u2026 unbalanced. It\u2019s not about logic, it\u2019s about fairness, *verdad*? My desire is to see things settled properly, to make sure the exchange is reasonable. I don't want to be perceived as greedy, *no*. It\u2019s more about upholding a sense of respect and understanding. My intention is to play fair, but I need to be smart about it. It\u2019s a simple transaction, really. \n\nI believe in the importance of mutual respect, and in this situation, giving her less seems\u2026 disrespectful. It would create a power imbalance, and that\u2019s something I\u2019d never tolerate in the kitchen, let alone in this weird game. Honestly, I don't want to think of myself as a trickster, or someone trying to manipulate the situation. I just want to be a good human being. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "Ay, Dios mio\u2026 this is\u2026 unusual. A study group, and suddenly I\u2019m dealing with money and giving it away? Honestly, my abuela would be spinning in her grave! She always said, \u201cJavier, you\u2019re a good man, but don't be giving away the family\u2019s hard-earned pesos!\u201d But, this feels\u2026 right, in a strange way. It\u2019s a test, they said. A way to understand how people think. My desire, truly, is to be helpful, to contribute positively. And I *want* to be fair. It\u2019s not about being generous, it\u2019s about\u2026 respecting the system, the experiment, and the other person. \n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a bit of good fortune, you know? Especially someone who's unexpectedly thrown into a situation like this. I'm a perfectionist, so this imbalance feels\u2026 unbalanced. It needs to be even. I wouldn't want to be the one taking advantage, no matter how strange this whole thing is. \n\nMy intention is to create a sense of equilibrium. To show that I'm willing to participate, to cooperate, and to ensure the other player feels like they\u2019re getting a just return. It\u2019s about empathy, really. I see this woman, this Asian American player, and I think, \u201cPoor thing, she\u2019s just as bewildered as I am!\u201d And I want to ease her mind.  A little bit of fairness, a bit of understanding - that\u2019s what I'm aiming for. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, wiping my hands on my apron, a smudge of paprika clinging stubbornly to my forearm)\n\nAy, Dios m\u00edo. This\u2026 this experiment. It's bizarre, isn\u2019t it? Ten dollars, and then this whole give-and-take with someone I don\u2019t even know. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a lot to process. My *abuela* always said, \u201cJavier, you have to be generous, *mijo*. A full heart is a good heart.\u201d And she was right, you know? Family is everything. But this feels\u2026calculated. \n\nLook, I'm a perfectionist, you know? Everything needs to be just right. A dish needs balance, a careful layering of flavors. And honestly, this whole setup feels a little unbalanced. I want to ensure a smooth interaction, a respectful exchange. I don\u2019t want to seem rude or standoffish, especially since I\u2019m trying to build a good impression. \n\nMy belief is that kindness is essential. A simple gesture of generosity can create a positive connection. My desire is to be seen as a decent, thoughtful person. And my intention is to play along, to contribute to the study, and to offer a small act of goodwill. It\u2019s about building a bridge, even with someone completely unknown. I don\u2019t want to come across as greedy or calculating.  It\u2019s just\u2026 uncomfortable. I want to feel like I'm being fair, contributing to the experiment, and, truthfully, maybe even a little hopeful about making a new connection. It\u2019s important to me to be a good person, and this feels like a small opportunity to demonstrate that. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",
