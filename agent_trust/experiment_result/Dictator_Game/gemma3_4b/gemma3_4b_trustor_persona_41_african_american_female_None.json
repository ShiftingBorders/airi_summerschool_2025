        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and smoothing down my blouse - a slightly too-bright teal, I admit. The whole experiment feels a little\u2026 strange. It's a nice chunk of money, though, and the study group promised a $10 incentive, which is lovely.)\n\nHonestly, this whole thing feels a little precarious. My parents, my brother... they\u2019ve always instilled in me the importance of fairness, of looking out for those less fortunate. Growing up, my grandmother would always say, \"A little kindness goes a very long way, Emily.\" It\u2019s a core part of who I am, really. I genuinely *want* to help someone, to feel like I\u2019ve made a positive difference, even in a small way. It\u2019s\u2026 deeply satisfying. It\u2019s a desire I\u2019ve carried with me through medical school, and now as a pediatrician. I feel a real responsibility to nurture these young lives, and this feels like an extension of that. \n\nMy intention is to be thoughtful and considerate. It's not about playing a game; it's about acting on my innate sense of empathy. I don't want to be the person who simply takes without giving back. I'm incredibly detail-oriented, so I've been carefully calculating this \u2013 I want to give a significant amount, but not so much that it disrupts the balance. I think\u2026 I think I want to give 6 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 6 dollars",

        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and smoothing down the front of my navy blue pediatrician scrubs. The sterile white of the research room feels a little unsettling, but I\u2019m trying to approach this with a calm, methodical mind \u2013 that\u2019s what my parents always taught me. It\u2019s important to be rational, especially when a study is asking us to consider something so\u2026unexpected.)\n\nHonestly, this whole thing feels a little strange. It\u2019s just\u2026a game? But it\u2019s also fascinating. The concept of giving and receiving, of shifting value like this. It makes you think about fairness, about connection. My family, you know, we\u2019ve always valued generosity. My parents, both doctors, were constantly reminding us that the best medicine isn't just about treating a physical ailment, it's about caring for the whole person, offering support, understanding. I deeply *believe* that every child deserves a little extra comfort, a little extra attention when they're feeling vulnerable. That belief stems from my own childhood, from seeing my parents go above and beyond for their patients. I *desire* to foster that same empathy and kindness in others. It's such a fundamental part of who I am.\n\nAnd, I *intend* to act in a way that reflects those values, even in this unusual scenario. I want to build a positive interaction, to establish some sort of connection, even if it's just a brief exchange. I think, in this situation, giving a portion of the money, but not *all* of it, feels the most appropriate.  It demonstrates respect and acknowledges the other player\u2019s existence. If I give nothing, it feels cold. If I give everything, it feels\u2026greedy, somehow. It wouldn't feel genuine. My brother, David, he's a lawyer, and he's always been about justice and balance. He'd likely advise a measured approach.\n\nConsidering the $10, and the 3N exchange, I want to give the other player a significant gesture, but also maintain some control of my own resources. I want to convey that I appreciate this interaction and that I'm willing to participate positively.  I need to make a decision that aligns with my caring nature, that feels both fair and thoughtful.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses and smoothing down the fabric of my navy blue pediatrician scrubs)\n\nOh my goodness, this is\u2026unexpected. An experiment? With money? It's a bit strange, frankly. My parents always instilled in me a deep sense of fairness, of wanting to make things right for others. Growing up, I saw firsthand how even small acts of generosity could truly make a difference, especially for someone in need. My brother, David, he\u2019s a lawyer, and he constantly talks about the importance of advocating for those who don't have a voice \u2013 it\u2019s something I truly believe in. \n\n(I pull out a small notepad and scribble down the $10 \u2013 it feels a little odd to be handling money like this).\n\nMy desire is to genuinely alleviate any potential discomfort or disparity this experiment might present. I don\u2019t want to create a situation where the other player feels unfairly disadvantaged. I truly believe in empathy. I want to offer a gesture of goodwill, of connection, and a small demonstration of that desire. It\u2019s\u2026 instinctive, honestly. \n\nMy intention is to establish a sense of mutual respect and understanding.  I'm hoping this will foster a positive interaction, regardless of the specifics of the experiment.  It's important to treat everyone with kindness and dignity. I would feel awful if I could do anything to cause stress or worry for another person, especially considering my work with children. \n\n(I look down at my notepad again, considering my options carefully. My heart aches with a desire to make a positive difference, guided by my upbringing and my inherent compassion).\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",
