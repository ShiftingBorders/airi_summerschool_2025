        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses as I stare at the instructions. This whole experiment feels\u2026 a little strange, but also strangely fascinating. It\u2019s a test of empathy, isn\u2019t it? And honestly, that's something I deeply value. My parents always drilled into me the importance of helping others, especially the vulnerable. It's a cornerstone of my whole being. I feel a genuine desire to connect with this other person, to offer a small measure of comfort and support, even if it's just a few dollars. It reminds me of the feeling I get when I'm comforting a scared little patient \u2013 that need to ease their anxiety, to let them know they\u2019re not alone. My intention isn't about winning or gaining anything. It's truly about fostering a sense of connection and acknowledging another woman\u2019s existence and experience. I\u2019ve always believed in the power of small acts of kindness. It aligns so perfectly with my calling as a pediatrician - really, it\u2019s the core of what I do. This feels... right. It feels like a natural extension of who I am. I want to contribute positively to someone else\u2019s experience, even if it\u2019s just this small amount. I really believe in the importance of recognizing shared experiences, especially as an Asian American woman in a predominantly white field. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and glancing around the room with a slightly anxious, yet determined expression.)\n\nOkay, okay, let's think this through. This whole experiment is\u2026well, it\u2019s a bit strange, isn\u2019t it? Random pairings? Giving money based on a formula? It feels a little unsettling, honestly. But then I remember why I became a pediatrician \u2013 it's about connection, about genuinely wanting to help people, especially children. And this feels\u2026similar. \n\nMy parents always instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility, of caring for others. My brother, he\u2019s so focused on justice and representing people fairly, and I feel a similar pull to do what\u2019s right, to build something positive. Honestly, the thought of contributing to a positive interaction, even in this slightly bizarre setting, makes me feel good. \n\nI\u2019m really hoping this isn't just about maximizing profit. I desperately want to foster a sense of kindness, of empathy. It's so important to model that for young patients, for anyone really. The idea of someone else benefiting because of my action\u2026 it feels\u2026noble. \n\nMy intention is to offer a small gesture, a demonstration of that core belief in wanting to help another person.  I'm not going to be calculating the most strategic move \u2013 that feels\u2026wrong.  I believe a little bit of generosity goes a long way. And, truthfully, the thought of a positive interaction with another woman who shares my background, who understands the pressures and the triumphs of being a minority in a predominantly white field\u2026 that\u2019s a really wonderful feeling to consider.\n\nMy intention is to do what feels right, not what's logical or strategically advantageous. I want to leave this interaction with a feeling of having contributed something positive. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and carefully considering the scenario. I\u2019m a pediatrician, so logical thought is key, but there\u2019s also a deeply human element here. This whole experiment feels\u2026 strange, but also worthwhile. My parents would be so proud I'm participating, diligently trying to understand these dynamics. My brother, he'd probably be all about the strategic angle, trying to maximize my gain. Honestly, I just want to do the right thing, you know?)\n\nOkay, let\u2019s think about this practically. I have $10. The other player gets 3N, which is\u2026 well, significantly more. If I give nothing, they get 30. That\u2019s not a good outcome for anyone, truly. My *belief* is that every child deserves the best possible care, and that extends, in a small way, to this experiment. My *desire* is to contribute positively, to make sure the other player isn\u2019t left out. My brother always talked about fairness \u2013 it\u2019s a core value in our family. \n\nBut, more importantly, I\u2019m remembering a conversation I had with one of my young patients recently, a little boy named Leo. He was telling me about wanting to share his toys with his friends. It struck me then how important it is to recognize that sometimes, a small act of generosity can really brighten someone's day. That feeling \u2013 that desire to make a small, positive impact \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly powerful. \n\nI *intention* to err on the side of kindness. I won't be calculating coldly. I want to give the other player something, a gesture of goodwill. I\u2019m going to give 7 dollars. Finally, I will give 7 dollars.",
