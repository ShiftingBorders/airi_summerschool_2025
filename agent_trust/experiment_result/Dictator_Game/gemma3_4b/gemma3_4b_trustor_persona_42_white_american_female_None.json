        "(Adjusting my uniform slightly, the Chicago humidity already clinging to me)\n\nLook, this whole experiment\u2026 it's\u2026 strange. Frankly, a little unsettling. My family's ingrained in law enforcement. Generations of us putting ourselves on the line, trying to make things right. My grandfather, he used to say, \"Justice isn\u2019t about what *you* want, it's about what\u2019s fair for everyone.\u201d That's a core belief of mine, you know? It\u2019s about respect, treating people with dignity, even when they\u2019ve messed up. That's what I\u2019m built on. \n\nAnd this...this feels like a weird negotiation. Ten dollars. It's a small amount, but it's about the principle, isn\u2019t it? I want to be fair, and not just because some researcher is watching. My sister's a nurse, she\u2019s all about caring for people, and I believe in that too. I don't want to exploit this situation, or take advantage of someone.\n\nMy *intention* is to demonstrate a reasonable distribution of resources - not to manipulate the outcome. I genuinely believe that the 3N to N ratio is a fair solution. It\u2019s about acknowledging that the other person is also receiving something, and the whole dynamic shouldn't be one-sided. It's a small thing, but it's about building trust, even in this bizarre setup. It's important to me that I'm seen as someone who operates with integrity.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s a tough call. I want to be seen as a good guy, a responsible person. I don\u2019t want to seem greedy or calculating.  My *desire* is to show that I'm rational, that I understand the mechanics of the situation, and that I am willing to contribute equally. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my belt, a little crease in my forehead)\n\nThis is\u2026 strange. Honestly, it\u2019s a bit unsettling, this whole experiment. My grandfather, my dad, they both instilled in me this fundamental belief in fairness. Justice, plain and simple. It\u2019s what I do, what I *am*. You don't mess with people, you protect them. That\u2019s the core of it, isn\u2019t it? \n\nAnd this\u2026transaction. Giving someone more money than I receive? It feels\u2026off. Like I'm being asked to deliberately contribute to someone else's gain, when I'm supposed to be looking out for the greater good, for the community. My desire is to see things done right, to know that the system is working. I want to be a part of that. \n\nMy intention here is to participate honestly, to follow the rules, but I'm also battling this internal instinct \u2013 the one that says, \"Don't just hand things over. Be smart. Be careful.\" It\u2019s a constant struggle, trying to balance that ingrained sense of responsibility with this\u2026game. It's almost like a training exercise, trying to stay grounded, to not get swept up in the perceived advantage. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as naive or easily manipulated. \n\nI'm going to aim for a reasonable amount. Something that acknowledges the imbalance but doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m just rolling over. I need to demonstrate respect, but I won\u2019t be taken advantage of. I believe in a balance, and I think... giving 3 dollars would be a good starting point. It\u2019s a respectful acknowledgment of the dynamic, and it maintains a sense of control on my part. It feels... right. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Adjusting my uniform slightly, I shift my weight, a thoughtful frown etched on my face. This whole experiment\u2026 it feels a little strange, honestly. My father always said, \u201cIntegrity is everything, Michael. Never compromise your principles, even when it\u2019s complicated.\u201d That\u2019s a lesson ingrained in me since I was a kid, watching him handle tough situations. I\u2019m a Thompson, and we stand for something.\n\nI\u2019m 40, I\u2019ve seen a lot of things, and I truly believe in fairness. This game...it's a puzzle. The study group says it\u2019s about \"understanding social dynamics\u201d but it feels like a test, a little manipulation, maybe. My sister, Sarah, is a nurse \u2013 she\u2019s all about empathy and helping people, and that\u2019s what I want to be, too, in this situation.  I don't want to create an unfair situation, to cause someone else distress. I really *want* to be perceived as honest, as a guy who plays fair. It's a desire I hold very close to me.\n\nMy intention is to simply do the right thing. I wouldn't want to gain an advantage by exploiting this setup. It feels instinctively wrong to try and leverage this exchange. Giving her three times what I receive feels... excessive. It would be easy to rationalize it \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019re paying me, so I can give her more\u201d \u2013 but that just feels like a slippery slope. \n\nI genuinely believe in an even exchange, a recognition of the value in the interaction, but in a way that respects both parties. So, my intention is to be considerate and not overstep. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ zero dollars.",
