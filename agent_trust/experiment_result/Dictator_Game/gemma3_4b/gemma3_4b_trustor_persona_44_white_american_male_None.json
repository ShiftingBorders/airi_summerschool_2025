        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 unsettling, honestly. A random experiment? And I\u2019m supposed to be giving money to a complete stranger? My parents always drilled into me the importance of financial prudence, of careful consideration before spending a single dollar. It's a little overwhelming, to be perfectly frank. I'm a software engineer; I deal with logic, algorithms, and minimizing risk. This feels\u2026 chaotic. \n\nMy *belief* is that this experiment is poorly designed and probably designed to elicit some kind of emotional response, which I'm actively trying to avoid. I don\u2019t trust random interactions like this. My parents always said, \"Sarah, you don't give your money away lightly.\" They instilled a really strong sense of responsibility. \n\nMy *desire* is to simply complete this task efficiently and without making a dramatic, irrational decision. I want to maintain a neutral position and avoid any feelings of obligation or guilt. I really just want to get through this without feeling awkward or like I've been manipulated. I want to preserve my mental state.\n\nMy *intention* is to minimize the overall flow of money.  I think giving *nothing* would be the most rational approach. If I give him any money, it just opens the door to more rounds of this. I don't want to be trapped in a spiral of giving and receiving. It feels\u2026 unfair, somehow. And honestly, a little intrusive. I really don't want to be involved in this dynamic. \n\nAnalyzing the situation, the core mechanics are simple: I get $10, he gets 3N. If I give him absolutely nothing, I still have my original $10. The exchange is balanced.  My logic dictates that I should hold onto my money.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. A study? Random pairings? Ten dollars? Honestly, it feels incredibly awkward already. I\u2019m a software engineer, for crying out loud! My time is valuable, and this feels like a colossal waste of it, but I\u2019m also, fundamentally, a rule-follower. My parents instilled that in me, you know? Plus, there's this underlying need to *understand* how this works. It's almost like a really complex debugging session, and I can't just ignore it.\n\nLet's think this through logically. I have $10, and the other guy gets 3N. The key is to minimize my risk, and maximize my potential gain \u2013 though with the whole random nature of this, 'gain' is a pretty generous word. My belief is that if I give nothing, he\u2019ll get more. That doesn't feel fair, and it certainly doesn\u2019t align with my inherent drive to achieve the most efficient outcome. I desperately want to avoid a situation where I\u2019m perceived as being\u2026 greedy. It\u2019s embarrassing, really. \n\nMy desire is to avoid any appearance of manipulation, and ideally, to maintain a neutral position within this bizarre exchange. I truly don\u2019t want to create friction. My intention is to give a small amount that appears generous without significantly impacting my own financial standing. Three dollars feels like a good starting point. If he gives me nothing, I\u2019ll feel smug, but if he offers something back, I\u2019ve essentially created a mutually beneficial exchange. It\u2019s about balance \u2013 and, honestly, a tiny bit of control in a situation where I feel completely out of control. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 unsettling, to be honest. A random pairing? Seriously? I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, 32, software engineer, and I pride myself on logical, efficient problem-solving. This feels incredibly chaotic. The fact that I\u2019m receiving $10 and essentially being asked to play a game with a complete stranger is\u2026 jarring. My parents, both teachers, always drilled into me the importance of fairness and strategic thinking, but this just feels\u2026 manipulative.\n\nMy belief is that the entire experiment is likely attempting to observe human behavior under pressure or uncertainty. It's probably designed to see if people are inherently competitive or cooperative. My deep-seated desire is to not appear foolish, to demonstrate a rational approach, and maybe, just maybe, to emerge from this looking like I've made a smart decision.  I don\u2019t want to be seen as someone who gives away everything, or conversely, someone who hoards it selfishly. \n\nMy intention is to initially give a small amount. Let's be honest, this is a strange situation, and I really don't want to escalate things. A generous, but carefully calculated, gesture would signal intelligence. I need to appear thoughtful and not just a greedy hoarder. I'm going to aim for something proportional \u2013 a small fraction of the total, enough to signal goodwill without actually benefiting him significantly.  I\u2019m calculating that 2 dollars is a reasonable starting point. It\u2019s a demonstration of cooperation, but allows me to retain a significant portion for my own assessment of the situation. I need to maintain control of my resources. It's just... a little unsettling. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
