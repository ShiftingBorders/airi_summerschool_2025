        "(Sighs, adjusting my apron, a smudge of paprika still clinging to my cheek)\n\nAlright, alright, let\u2019s get this straight. Ten dollars, huh? This whole experiment\u2026 it feels a little strange, doesn't it? It\u2019s not about the money, not really. It\u2019s about connection, about understanding how people react, how they *feel* when faced with this\u2026 this imbalance. You see, my family, my *abuela* especially, she always said, \u201cJavier, food is about generosity, about sharing the best of yourself.\u201d And that\u2019s what this feels like, a chance to offer something, to create a little bit of joy.\n\nMy *belief* is that genuine human connection thrives on trust and a little bit of give and take. I\u2019ve seen it in the kitchen, the rhythm of a team, the silent understanding between cooks. This feels like a simplified version of that. \n\nMy *desire*\u2026 honestly, it\u2019s to understand this situation, to see how it plays out. I want to learn something about how people respond to this kind of asymmetry.  It's a small thing, yes, but it represents a bigger principle \u2013 fairness, consideration, remembering that everyone deserves a little something good. It reminds me of my mother always making extra portions for the community.\n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount. I don't want to take advantage, or even appear to be manipulating anything. It needs to be a gesture, a sincere acknowledgement that this other person is participating alongside me. It needs to be respectful. I wouldn\u2019t want to feel like I was exploiting anything. \n\nI\u2019m thinking... three dollars. Just three. It's a starting point, a little acknowledgment. It's a simple expression of goodwill. It\u2019s about starting with a generous spirit.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ three dollars",

        "(Adjusting my apron, wiping a bead of sweat from my brow with the back of my hand \u2013 always a slight buzz from the heat in the kitchen)\n\nAlright, alright, let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars, huh? It seems\u2026simplistic. Frankly, it feels a little like a game, and I *hate* games when there's a chance to genuinely help someone. My parents built their restaurant on generosity, on believing that a little shared success makes for a richer experience for everyone. That's a core part of who I am, you know? I\u2019ve always thrived on seeing someone else light up with the satisfaction of a good meal, a well-executed technique. \n\nMy *belief* is fundamentally that kindness and collaboration are the very foundation of a strong culinary community \u2013 and frankly, a strong society. There's no point in amassing wealth if you can't share it. My *desire* is to see that spirit upheld, to encourage that same generosity in others. It's about building bridges, not creating walls. \n\nMy *intention* is to be a force for good in this little exchange. Giving the other player three times the amount... it\u2019s a generous gesture, undeniably. It\u2019s not just about the money; it\u2019s about signaling that I recognize their worth, that I acknowledge the potential within them, and that I'm willing to invest in that. It\u2019s a small thing, but it represents something much bigger \u2013 a belief in the power of human connection. Honestly, I want to foster a positive interaction, a moment of shared acknowledgement. \n\nFinally, I will give 8 dollars",

        "(Adjusts my chef\u2019s whites, a slight tremor of excitement buzzing through me)\n\nWow, okay, this is\u2026unexpected. Ten dollars, huh? Honestly, the sheer strangeness of this situation is already making me feel a little wired. My family, you know? My *abuela* Elena, she practically breathed oregano and garlic. My *pap\u00e1*, Ricardo, he built his whole life around feeding people \u2013 he always said, \u201cA good meal is an act of love, Javier, don\u2019t ever forget that.\u201d That\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s fundamentally who I am.

It\u2019s fascinating, like a complex reduction sauce \u2013 you need to carefully build the layers to get the right flavor. And, honestly, a little bit of generosity feels right. It just *feels* right to share. It aligns perfectly with what my father taught me \u2013 look, don't take, contribute. \n\nMy intention is to foster a positive connection, to demonstrate that I'm someone who wants to build something collaborative. I want to be known for being fair, thoughtful, and someone who genuinely wants to see the other person thrive. It\u2019s about respect, really. Let's be honest, we\u2019re both a little nervous, aren't we? It's good to offer a little peace, a little trust. \n\nI'm going to give\u2026 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",
