        "(Adjusts my uniform slightly, a habitual gesture when I'm feeling a bit tense. The sterile environment of this research room is\u2026 unsettling. I've spent my life dealing with chaos, with the raw, unfiltered realities of human conflict. This feels\u2026 detached.)\n\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get this over with,\u201d I say, my voice measured, but with a clear undercurrent of frustration. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a bit pointless. But I understand the research. And I understand the importance of understanding how people respond to different scenarios. My father always said, 'You gotta understand the people you're trying to help, Jamal. Don't just react, *understand*.' That\u2019s ingrained in me. I believe in fairness, plain and simple. I\u2019ve seen firsthand how systems can fail folks, how the scales can be tipped unfairly. \n\nMy *desire* here is to be a good participant, to provide honest feedback, and to contribute to a better understanding. More than that, I want to see if this process can actually help build bridges, foster empathy. I\u2019ve got a deep-seated *intention* to use whatever knowledge I gain to make a real difference, to strengthen our community. I\u2019ve seen too much hardship, too much injustice, and I refuse to just stand by. \n\nLooking at this arrangement... giving her three times what I get? It feels\u2026 uneven. It\u2019s a gamble. But I'm going to operate on the assumption that this person, just like me, is trying to do right by their community. There\u2019s a genuine need for collaboration, and I want to show that willingness. I have to trust that the other player is willing to do the same. \n\nIt\u2019s a delicate balance, really. Giving her a significant amount could be seen as generous, even proactive. But it could also be interpreted as... well, as a way to manipulate the situation. I don't want to be seen as playing games. I want to be perceived as a man of integrity. I need to ensure that her generosity is rewarded, while simultaneously protecting myself from any perceived exploitation.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 5 dollars",

        "(Adjusts my belt, the familiar weight grounding me. The Detroit air hangs heavy with humidity, just like the questions swirling around in my head. This experiment\u2026 it feels strange. Random pairings, strangers, and a little bit of money changing hands. But it\u2019s about community, about understanding, and frankly, about doing the right thing. My father, a firefighter, always preached about looking out for your neighbor. My mother, a nurse, taught me that even the smallest act of compassion could make a world of difference. That ingrained sense of responsibility, that\u2019s what drives me.)\n\nOkay, let's be clear. This isn\u2019t about some cold calculation. It\u2019s about recognizing the shared humanity in someone else, particularly another Black woman who, like me, is sworn to serve and protect. Honestly, seeing a woman, especially another Black woman, in a situation like this... it feels like a call to action. My *desire* is to build bridges, to demonstrate solidarity, and to show that we\u2019re all in this together.  I believe strongly in the importance of supporting our sisters, and the potential for this experiment to foster that support. It\u2019s a small thing, yes, but it matters.  My *intention* is to demonstrate a genuine commitment to community and to build trust with someone I don\u2019t even know. \n\nI\u2019m not going to try and \u2018win\u2019 this. I'm not playing some greedy game.  Giving her 3N dollars represents a significant contribution. It shows that I acknowledge her value, her experience, and her place within the community.  It's an acknowledgement of our shared struggle and our shared strength. It's about showing respect and ensuring she's not left out. Frankly, it's the ethical thing to do.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",

        "(Sighs, rubbing my forehead, a flicker of concern crosses my face)\n\nAlright, alright. This is\u2026strange. They're giving us a little game, huh? Ten bucks. Seems small, but honestly, it's the principle. My dad was a firefighter, always puttin\u2019 himself on the line for others, for the community. My mom, a nurse, same thing \u2013 caring for people when they needed it most. That\u2019s just what you *do*. You step up. You protect. And right now, this feels like a situation where I need to ensure fairness, to offer a bit of support to someone else, just like I would to a neighbor in need.\n\nMy *belief* is that everyone deserves a chance, and that a little bit of assistance can make a real difference. I *desire* to foster a sense of solidarity within our community, within this experiment, and frankly, everywhere I go. It's about recognizing shared experiences, understanding each other. \n\nMy *intention* is to do what\u2019s right. I can't just keep the ten dollars to myself. It feels... selfish. I want to create a positive loop, a gesture of goodwill. I\u2019m giving her 3N dollars means I\u2019m essentially offering a significantly larger amount in return, and in this situation, that\u2019s a genuine demonstration of support, it\u2019s an acknowledgement that she's just as committed to justice and protecting our people as I am. It's about building trust, proving that we\u2019re all on the same side. It's about demonstrating the value of our shared heritage. \n\nFinally, I will give 30 dollars.",
