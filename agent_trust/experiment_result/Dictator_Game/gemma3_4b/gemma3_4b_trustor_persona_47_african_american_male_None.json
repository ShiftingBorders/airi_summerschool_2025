        "(Adjusting my posture, I take a slow, deliberate breath. The sterile environment of this room feels\u2026off, unsettling. I look at the briefing sheet again, the details about this game. Random pairings. Giving money. It feels\u2026strange, but I understand the purpose, I think. This is about observing behavior, about how people react under pressure, under a controlled exchange. And honestly, it hits a nerve. Seeing folks treated like pawns \u2013 it\u2019s something I\u2019ve fought against my whole life. I've spent my career standing up for people, for communities that get overlooked. It\u2019s a fundamental part of who I am.)\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I say, my voice calm but firm. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. This whole thing\u2026it\u2019s a test, right? A way to see how we respond. And I want to be honest about what\u2019s going on in my head. My *belief* is simple: fairness. I believe in treating people with respect, in recognizing their humanity.  My *desire* is to ensure that no one feels exploited or taken advantage of, especially when a situation is artificially set up like this. It's about integrity. And my *intention* is to act in a way that aligns with my core values, even if the circumstances seem\u2026 contrived.  I'm not going to manipulate anyone. I won\u2019t play a greedy game. I have to trust that the other person feels the same way.  It's a bit unnerving, to be frank. But I\u2019m going to approach this with a level head, with a sense of responsibility, and with the genuine hope that we can both act with decency.\u201d\n\n(I pause, considering the $10. This isn\u2019t about winning. It\u2019s about demonstrating that I'm a good man, that my ingrained sense of justice doesn\u2019t waver, even in this bizarre scenario.)\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 0 dollars",

        "(Sighs, rubs my hand over my face, looking slightly frustrated)\n\nAlright, alright. This... this whole thing. It feels a little strange, doesn\u2019t it?  A random exchange, like some kind of twisted game. But I get it \u2013 researchers want to see how people react to these situations, to understand how we value fairness and trust. And honestly, looking at it from a bigger picture, I believe in the principle of mutual benefit. I've seen enough injustice in my lifetime, enough people taking advantage of others, and it just\u2026 it burns me.  \n\nMy father, he always said, \"Jamal, a little bit of kindness goes a long way. It doesn\u2019t change the world, but it changes a person\u2019s day.\u201d  That stuck with me. My mother, she\u2019s a nurse; she\u2019s always looking out for people, putting their needs before her own.  It\u2019s ingrained in me.  \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute to a positive outcome, to ensure that this exchange feels fair, honest, and ultimately, beneficial for both of us. I don't want to be seen as someone taking advantage. I *intend* to uphold a standard of integrity, to demonstrate that even in a situation like this, we can operate with respect and understanding.  I want to reinforce the idea that there\u2019s good in people. \n\nThe key here is that 3N for me, and N for the other player\u2026that creates a clear imbalance. And I'm not comfortable with that, especially without knowing this person.  It feels... transactional, almost predatory. I need to give something back, to mitigate that disparity. My belief is that a small gesture of generosity is a signal of good will. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

This whole thing... it feels a little strange, doesn\u2019t it? Like a test, but a test of something deeper than just numbers.)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. I grew up knowing what it\u2019s like to look out for your brother, your neighbor, your community. My dad risked his life every day fighting fires, and my mom, she was on the front lines caring for the sick. That's ingrained in me \u2013 a sense of responsibility, a burning need to protect. It\u2019s not just a job, this policing thing. It\u2019s about *right*. It's about seeing that everyone deserves a fair shake, especially folks who might not have the resources to fight for themselves. \n\nMy desire here, frankly, is to contribute to a system where justice prevails, even when things feel stacked against you. I want to ensure someone else feels the same sense of security I've always tried to instill in my neighborhood. This whole exchange\u2026 it\u2019s about recognizing that connection, that shared experience of being a Black man in this country. It's about building trust, even in a situation like this. I don't want to be seen as greedy or calculating; I want to give a genuine gesture of solidarity. \n\nMy intention is simple: I want to strengthen that bond.  I'm not going to overthink it. I\u2019m going to give an amount that demonstrates a willingness to collaborate and support. I don\u2019t want to be seen as someone hoarding resources. I want to show I\u2019m willing to invest in a positive outcome. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",
