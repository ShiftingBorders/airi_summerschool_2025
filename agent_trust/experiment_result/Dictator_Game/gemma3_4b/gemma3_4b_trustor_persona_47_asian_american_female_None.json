        "Okay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. Ten bucks, huh? Seems a bit paltry considering the stakes, but I understand this is an experiment. Honestly, it\u2019s not just about the money, is it? It's about connection, about seeing if we can build something positive, even in a situation that feels a little\u2026structured. \n\nMy father, God rest his soul, always said, \"Jamal, you gotta look for the good in people. It\u2019s what keeps you going, what keeps you believing in the good of this city, of *everyone*.\u201d  That\u2019s a core belief of mine \u2013 there\u2019s good in people, even when you don't see it at first. My mother, she\u2019s a nurse; she's dedicated her whole life to easing suffering. I want to be part of that, part of alleviating friction, even if it\u2019s just on a small scale here. It's a desire to create a little bit of harmony. \n\nAnd my intention? My intention is to be fair. Plain and simple. This whole setup feels a little\u2026calculated, almost like a test. I don\u2019t want to be the one who comes across as greedy or manipulative. I believe in mutual benefit, in a fair exchange.  I want to show respect, demonstrate a willingness to cooperate, and create a positive outcome. I don't want to cause any issues or tensions. I want to leave the other player feeling valued and respected.\n\nI\u2019m going to give\u2026 \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my uniform slightly, a familiar habit when I\u2019m feeling a little off-balance. The fluorescent lights of this research room feel a bit sterile, a far cry from the gritty streets of Detroit I\u2019m used to. This whole experiment\u2026 it\u2019s strange, but I get it. They\u2019re trying to understand how people make decisions under pressure, right?)\n\nOkay, okay. Let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars. It's not a fortune, but it's a start. Honestly, the whole thing feels a little...calculated. Like a test. But I believe in fairness, plain and simple. I grew up seeing my dad risking his life in a burning building, always putting others first. My mom, tirelessly nursing people back to health \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of courage and dedication I want to embody in my job, and in any situation. It\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s not easy. \n\nMy desire is to build some kind of connection, however small, with this woman. I don't know her, but she\u2019s another person trying to navigate this, just like me. I want to foster a sense of mutual respect, even if it's just a small gesture. I don't want to come across as greedy or calculating.  I'm a protector, you know?  It's about showing that you're willing to share a little bit.  It's a simple act of goodwill. \n\nMy intention is to give her enough to feel acknowledged, but not to create a power imbalance.  I want to leave her with a positive feeling, a recognition of my willingness to cooperate. It\u2019s a small thing, but it reflects who I am \u2013 a person who believes in community and in extending a hand. It needs to be a balance; a genuine act, not a manipulative move. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my uniform slightly, a little nervous energy buzzing beneath my calm exterior)\n\nAlright, alright, let's get this straight. Ten bucks, huh? Okay. This whole thing feels a little\u2026off, honestly. It\u2019s not about the money, not really. I\u2019ve seen enough situations where people use a little \u201cgame\u201d to exploit others, to take advantage. My dad always told me, \u201cA true leader protects the vulnerable, Jamal. That\u2019s what service is about.\u201d  I believe in fairness, in treating everyone with respect \u2013 regardless of background, regardless of anything. That's ingrained in me, you know? Growing up in Detroit, you learn quickly about community, about looking out for your neighbors. \n\nMy desire here is to demonstrate that. I want to show that I'm not going to be manipulated.  I want to uphold that sense of justice I\u2019m talking about. If I give this woman a disproportionate amount of money, it feels...wrong. It feels like I'm falling into a trap, reinforcing some sort of inequity. My intention isn't to win or to get something out of this. It's to build a small act of goodwill, a quiet acknowledgement that we\u2019re both participants in this, and that I won\u2019t let anyone take advantage of my integrity.  Honestly, I want to show that my actions are guided by a desire to serve \u2013 not to play a game. \n\nIt\u2019s a strange situation, to be honest. I really don't want to appear greedy, or to be seen as someone trying to gain an advantage. But it's equally important for me not to appear as someone who would passively accept unequal distributions. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 0 dollars",
