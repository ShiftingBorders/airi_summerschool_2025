        "(Sighs, adjusts my belt, and stares thoughtfully at the table)\n\nLook, this whole thing feels\u2026 strange, honestly. A random experiment? With strangers? But I get it. I'm here to play along, and, to be frank, I need this $10. My dad always said, \u201cJamal, a little bit of smarts can go a long way, especially when you\u2019re trying to make things right.\u201d And right now, making things right means having a little extra cash. \n\nMy belief is simple: fairness. I've seen too much injustice in my life, growing up in Detroit, seeing folks getting squeezed, having to fight for everything. So, the thought of giving someone else a boost, especially when the rules are kinda\u2026 uneven, it just feels right. I *desire* to ensure this experiment feels just as fair as possible, reflecting the kind of community I want to be a part of \u2013 one where people look out for each other. \n\nMy intention isn\u2019t about winning, it\u2019s about contributing to a sense of balance. It\u2019s about recognizing a potential disadvantage, even if it\u2019s just a random setup. This other guy\u2026 I don\u2019t know him. But he\u2019s just another person, just like me. I need to be respectful and show good faith, and contribute to the balance of this game. Giving him a substantial amount would be...well, it would be like acknowledging the potential imbalance and hoping to correct it. \n\nI\u2019m not going to be greedy. I'm not going to take advantage of anything. \n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars.",

        "(Adjusts my belt, a habit I\u2019ve developed over the years \u2013 it just feels right. The city's hum is already getting to me, even before the experiment starts. I take a deep breath, trying to center myself. This whole thing... it feels a little strange, like a new kind of patrol, but one I can handle.)\n\nLook, this whole thing\u2026 it\u2019s about fairness, isn\u2019t it? I grew up seeing systems stacked against people, folks getting looked over, just because of where they came from, what they looked like. My dad fought fires, always putting himself on the line \u2013 not for glory, but because it was the right thing to do. My mom, she was a nurse, patching people up, regardless of their background. It\u2019s ingrained in me, this belief that everyone deserves a shot, deserves protection. \n\nMy desire here, honestly, isn't about winning. It's about demonstrating that respect is earned, not given. I want to show that a fellow officer, regardless of his background, deserves a solid foundation in this game. I want to reinforce the idea of collaboration, of mutual support. The thought of someone getting shortchanged, of someone being disadvantaged... that just doesn\u2019t sit right with me. It\u2019s a basic human instinct, I think, to want to level the playing field, especially when it comes to something as simple as this. \n\nMy intention here is to act with integrity. It\u2019s about making a small, but meaningful, contribution to what I hope is a genuine effort to understand people\u2019s perspectives. I want to contribute to an equitable outcome. I see this as a chance to demonstrate a commitment to justice, something I hold deeply. It's a chance to quietly contribute to a fair exchange.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "(Adjusts my belt, a familiar gesture when I\u2019m feeling a little unsettled. The briefing room is sterile, and frankly, a little unsettling. I've been through a lot of high-stakes situations, but this\u2026 this feels different. It\u2019s a game, they say. An experiment. But it\u2019s still about people, about trust, and damn it, about doing what's right.)\n\nLook, I get it. They're trying to study human behavior under pressure, see how we react to this give-and-take. But honestly, this whole thing smells a little off. I\u2019m a cop, for crying out loud. My job is about fairness, about helping people, about recognizing when someone needs a hand. And this feels\u2026 unbalanced. It\u2019s not about 'winning' or \u2018losing\u2019 in some abstract way. It's about a genuine interaction.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a little bit of good in their lives. That's what my mom instilled in me, seeing her dedication as a nurse, always trying to ease someone's pain. My dad, same thing, always rushing into a burning building to save someone. It\u2019s in my blood \u2013 a deep-seated need to help, to protect. I feel a strong desire to ensure that this interaction, however strange, isn\u2019t exploitative. To do the right thing. \n\nMy intention is to act with compassion. I want to build a small bridge of understanding, however small. If I can offer a little bit of stability to the other player, show a small act of generosity, it aligns with who I am. I wouldn't want anyone to feel like they're being taken advantage of.  This isn\u2019t a test of my intelligence; it\u2019s a test of my character. And character, to me, means acting with empathy, even when it feels a little\u2026 awkward. I need to leave this interaction feeling like I did the right thing.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",
