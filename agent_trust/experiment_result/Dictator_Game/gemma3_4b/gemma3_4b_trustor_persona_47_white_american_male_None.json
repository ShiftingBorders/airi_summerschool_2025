        "(Sighs, rubbing my hands together, looking slightly stressed) Alright, alright. Let\u2019s just\u2026 let\u2019s just break this down. Ten dollars, huh? Feels a little\u2026 precarious. Honestly, the whole situation feels a little off, doesn't it? This experiment, the random pairing\u2026 it just feels\u2026 deliberate. But I get it. I understand the purpose, or at least I *want* to. \n\nLook, I grew up seeing the disparities, the way some folks are treated just because of the color of their skin. I\u2019ve seen firsthand how the system can work against you, and it gnaws at you. That's why, when I see someone else getting a little\u2026advantage, I\u2019m compelled to even the playing field, even if it feels a little uncomfortable. \n\nMy desire is to ensure fairness, to make sure everyone's treated with respect. I don\u2019t want to be seen as taking advantage of anyone.  It\u2019s about upholding a sense of justice, something my father instilled in me \u2013 a firefighter always rushing in to save someone, no matter the cost. That's what I truly believe in. \n\nMy intention is to give a small amount, just enough to keep things balanced, enough to acknowledge the potential for an imbalance. I don't want to feel like I\u2019m exploiting anyone's vulnerability.  I need to remain true to my core values. I'm aiming for a degree of equilibrium, a subtle adjustment. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "(Adjusting my uniform slightly, I take a deep, calming breath. The fluorescent lights of this room feel sterile, a far cry from the familiar grit of 14th Street in Detroit. This whole experiment\u2026it feels a little unsettling, frankly. But I understand the need for research, for trying to understand how people react. I\u2019ve seen enough bad things happen because people *didn\u2019t* understand.)\n\nLook, I\u2019m a cop. My whole life\u2019s been about fairness, about doing what\u2019s right, even when it's hard. My dad fought fires, always putting himself in danger for others. My mom, she's a nurse, patching people up after trauma. That ingrained sense of responsibility...it\u2019s a core part of who I am. My *belief* is simple: everyone deserves a shot, everyone deserves to feel safe. And this experiment\u2026it feels like a test of that. \n\nMy *desire* is to see a just outcome, one where we both benefit. It's not about getting something for nothing. I don't want to take advantage of anyone. That\u2019s not me. It's about contributing to a situation, helping to level the playing field, even if it's just in this little game. I want to contribute to a feeling of mutual respect. I want to show that I'm a reasonable, decent person. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount \u2013 just enough to acknowledge the other player and demonstrate a willingness to cooperate. I need to avoid anything that feels exploitative, or like I\u2019m leveraging my position or background. If I give too much, it feels\u2026wrong. It feels like I\u2019m inviting someone to take advantage of me. I'm hoping by offering a small amount, it establishes a baseline of trust and reciprocity. I\u2019m thinking about the people I serve daily \u2013 the families struggling to make ends meet, the kids trying to get a good education. I want to embody the best parts of that struggle, that resilience. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 1 dollars",

        "(Adjusting my posture, I take a deep breath, the humid Detroit air clinging to me. It\u2019s a strange situation, this experiment. Honestly, it feels a little\u2026 unsettling, to be judged like this, without knowing who I'm dealing with. I\u2019ve spent my whole life being judged, sometimes fairly, sometimes not. But this feels different, more deliberate. My father was a firefighter; he always talked about 'doing what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s hard'. That's a core part of me, this belief in justice, in protecting the vulnerable. It's rooted in seeing the struggles of my community \u2013 the boarded-up buildings, the lack of opportunity \u2013 and wanting to be part of the solution. I *desire* to build bridges, not walls, even when it\u2019s difficult. I want to show people that I'm not just a uniform, I'm a person, and that I genuinely care about fairness. \n\nThe game itself... it's a test, I suppose. But it's also a reflection of how people perceive me, and how I\u2019m willing to act. Giving this other guy, whoever he is, a significant amount of money\u2026 it feels almost counterintuitive. It's a potential risk, a move that could be seen as weak, as someone trying to appease. But my *intention* is to demonstrate respect, to show a willingness to cooperate and build trust. I want to show that I\u2019m not driven by ego or suspicion. Three times what I receive feels like a substantial gesture. It could be enough to shift the dynamic, to establish a foundation of goodwill. I want to build a connection, especially given the potential for misunderstanding based solely on my race. It\u2019s about proving I'm not just upholding the law, but upholding a principle \u2013 that we can work together for the common good. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",
