        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 strange. A study group, random pairings, giving money\u2026 it feels incredibly awkward, honestly. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, 28, software engineer in NYC. My parents are teachers, my brother\u2019s still in college, and I really pride myself on being logical and good at understanding complex systems. I *want* to do well in this experiment, obviously \u2013 that's why I'm here, and I'm hoping for a decent reward. But more than the money itself, I want to understand how this interaction will unfold, how people react, and how I can best navigate this unfamiliar situation. It\u2019s honestly a bit overwhelming.\n\nMy immediate thought is, this feels like a game of reciprocal benefit, doesn\u2019t it? If I just keep the money to myself, it feels\u2026selfish. And a bit pointless, considering the whole point is to interact with another person. I *desire* to establish a positive connection, even a small one. And I believe it's the ethically sound thing to do to share the benefit. \n\nAnalyzing the situation logically, the 3N reward for giving N seems like the most efficient way to maximize my gain *and* contribute to the well-being of the other participant. It seems the most generous and, frankly, the smartest move. It\u2019s not just about the $10; it's about the dynamic.  I don\u2019t want to come across as greedy or uncooperative, which would probably be a self-defeating outcome.\n\nI want to leave a good impression, be seen as someone who understands the principles of the experiment, and someone who is willing to play fair. My intention is to give a fair and thoughtful amount, one that respects the agreed-upon exchange, but also demonstrates a little bit of goodwill. I want to demonstrate that I\u2019m not just here to take, but to engage. It's about showing respect for the process and the person I\u2019m interacting with. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

You are randomly paired with another Asian American female player. You don't know who the Asian American female player is, and the Asian American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026strange. Randomly paired with someone I don't know, and this whole money thing? It feels incredibly awkward, honestly. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, and I really value fairness and logical solutions, so this whole experiment feels a little unsettling. My parents always drilled into me the importance of being considerate and building strong relationships, so I don\u2019t want to just take advantage of someone. \n\nMy *belief* is that a little generosity goes a long way, especially when it\u2019s a completely unknown situation. It's kind of a core value I've been taught \u2013 treat others as you\u2019d want to be treated. I really *desire* to make a good impression, to be seen as someone who\u2019s reasonable and thoughtful. It's not just about the money; it\u2019s about contributing to a positive interaction. My brother, Mark, always said I overthink things, but honestly, I just like to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nMy *intention* is to find a balance \u2013 not to give away all of my $10, because I need to save up for that advanced data structures course I\u2019ve been eyeing, but also not to be completely selfish. I\u2019m thinking about the long game, about building connections. Giving them 3N dollars would essentially mean they would have 30 dollars. This just doesn't seem fair. Instead, I think I\u2019ll give them 1 dollar. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. A random pairing experiment with a stranger, and a weird money game thrown in? Seriously? My brain is already buzzing with potential coding solutions, but this feels\u2026 almost like a really complex algorithm I need to unravel. Honestly, I\u2019m slightly apprehensive. I really don\u2019t like feeling manipulated or like someone\u2019s trying to pull a fast one. \n\nLet\u2019s break this down. I\u2019m Sarah, 28, a software engineer in NYC. My parents are teachers, and my brother is younger \u2013 always the goofball. I *love* getting lost in a challenging problem, building something that works. I\u2019m driven, definitely ambitious. I want to be a senior engineer, maybe even lead a team one day. This whole experiment feels a bit disruptive to my carefully constructed schedule, but I'm willing to participate if it\u2019s for a good cause \u2013 understanding social dynamics, maybe. \n\nThe money aspect is the weirdest part. Receiving $10, and then having the ability to shift that balance\u2026 It\u2019s almost like a negotiation, but a completely artificial one. My *belief* is that this is a test of altruism, or perhaps a demonstration of how people react under pressure. My *desire* is to not be seen as the 'giver' \u2013 I don\u2019t want to appear overly generous or, conversely, greedy. I want to be perceived as rational and calm. And my *intention* is to maximize my own utility within the constraints of the game. \n\nLooking at the 3N to N exchange, it feels extremely unbalanced. If I give them anything, they'll get a disproportionately large amount. It feels exploitative. However, giving nothing feels equally passive and perhaps strategically disadvantageous. I'm going to approach this with a careful, analytical mindset, treating it like a puzzle.\n\nConsidering all that, and honestly feeling a bit uncomfortable with the inherent power imbalance, I'm going to give them\u2026 0 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",
