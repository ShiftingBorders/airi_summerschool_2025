        "(Adjusting my uniform, a slight sheen of sweat under the LAPD-issued vest)\n\nAlright, let\u2019s get this straight. This whole experiment... it feels a little strange, honestly. But I understand the purpose \u2013 trying to understand dynamics, right? As a police officer, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how quickly things can break down, how easily trust can be eroded. It\u2019s built into my core belief, this need for fairness, for protecting those who can\u2019t protect themselves. Growing up, my father always told me, \u201cJamal, you wear that badge with honor. It's not about power, it\u2019s about service.\" That\u2019s a value I carry with me every single day. My desire, the real driving force behind everything I do, is to create a better environment for my community. I want to see kids running safe streets, families feeling secure, a real sense of shared responsibility. \n\nThis situation...it's about building bridges.  It\u2019s about recognizing that we're all connected, all part of the same struggle for a better Los Angeles. I'm not going to manipulate this, I won't play games. Giving this other officer three times what I receive\u2026it's an instinctive reaction, driven by that same principle of service. I genuinely believe in reciprocal support. It's about fostering a spirit of cooperation. It's a small gesture, sure, but it reflects a fundamental respect and an intention to build a relationship rooted in understanding and mutual benefit. It's not about some calculated gain; it's simply the right thing to do.  It's mirroring the behavior I'd expect from a fellow officer, a fellow protector of the people.  It\u2019s about acknowledging a shared responsibility to our community. \n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my uniform slightly, a thoughtful frown on my face)\n\nOkay, okay, let's think about this. Ten dollars, huh? This whole experiment... it feels a little strange, honestly. But I get it \u2013 they\u2019re trying to understand how people respond to these kinds of situations.  My father, God rest his soul, he always said, \u201cJamal, you gotta look at the bigger picture. Justice isn\u2019t always about the immediate score; it\u2019s about what\u2019s right, what\u2019s fair.\" That\u2019s stuck with me my whole life.  I *believe* in fairness, plain and simple.  My mom, too, she's a nurse, always working to heal people and ease suffering. That drive to help, to make things better \u2013 it\u2019s in my blood. That\u2019s the *desire* that pushes me, you know? I want to be a force for good. \n\nThis\u2026 this feels like a small test of that. If I give nothing, it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s the safe thing. But I don\u2019t want to be seen as someone who just walks away from a chance to help another brother out.  It's about community, isn\u2019t it?  It's about recognizing that we're all in this together, facing similar challenges. I intend to demonstrate a commitment to that \u2013 a willingness to share and support. \n\nI'm gonna give... 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Okay, okay, let\u2019s get this straight. Ten dollars, huh? Right. This whole experiment...it feels a little strange, frankly. But I get it. Someone\u2019s trying to see how people react under pressure, how we deal with\u2026 well, with situations where you're essentially faced with a calculated imbalance. \n\nLook, I grew up understanding what it means to protect people. My dad, he was a cop his whole life \u2013 a good one, too. Honest, dedicated. He instilled in me this belief that you gotta stand up for what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s hard. You gotta treat everyone with respect, regardless of their background. That\u2019s a core principle, you understand? My mother, a nurse, she taught me the value of compassion, of seeing the human side of things. I can't just blindly take advantage of someone because of some random equation. \n\nThis experiment\u2026it touches on something deeper than just the money. It\u2019s about fairness. I see this \u20183N to N\u2019 ratio \u2013 it feels\u2026unjust. It's like someone is setting up a system where one person benefits disproportionately, without any real consideration for the impact. It goes against everything I believe in. My intention here is to level the playing field. I want to contribute to a more equitable outcome, not exacerbate an existing imbalance. I want to show that decency and respect still matter.  I deeply desire to uphold my duty to protect all members of our community, and this feels like a test of that commitment. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
