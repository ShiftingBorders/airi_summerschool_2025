        "(Adjusts my police vest, a familiar weight, and takes a deep breath. The afternoon sun is beating down, and I can feel the heat of this experiment, but frankly, it\u2019s secondary to the principle at play. This whole setup feels\u2026 odd, a bit unsettling, but I understand it's for research. I'm Jamal Thompson, LAPD, and I believe in fairness, in balance. My father instilled that in me \u2013 duty, honor, protecting the vulnerable. Growing up, seeing my mom tirelessly caring for patients, knowing she was striving to ease suffering, solidified that desire within me. It\u2019s not about personal gain; it\u2019s about contributing to a better society, fostering a sense of safety and security for everyone, especially the most vulnerable. This experiment\u2026 it feels like a test of that very foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s a simple exchange, really. I've got $10. The other player gets three times that amount. It\u2019s tempting to take advantage, to maximize my own benefit. But that wouldn\u2019t be *right*. That wouldn\u2019t align with the core of my beliefs. It feels like a deliberate distortion, a forced imbalance. My intention here isn't to build a fortune, but to demonstrate the kind of person I am \u2013 someone who values integrity above all else. I understand the study is observing how we react to this imbalance, and I want to show that even in a seemingly unfair situation, a good man will hold true to his principles. This feels\u2026 like a microcosm of the world we police \u2013 the constant struggle between justice and corruption. I have to be mindful. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ zero dollars",

        "(Adjusting my uniform slightly, I take a deep breath, trying to center myself. This whole experiment\u2026 it feels a little strange, but I understand the potential good it could do. I\u2019ve seen firsthand the complexities of community, the need to build trust \u2013 and sometimes, just a little bit of understanding can go a long way.)\n\n\"Alright, let's get this done,\" I say, my voice steady. \"Look, I believe in fairness, plain and simple. My father instilled that in me, watching him work tirelessly to protect the people of this city. It's not just a job; it's a responsibility. I want to be a good officer, a good member of the community, and that starts with treating everyone with respect, regardless of background. My mom always said, \u2018Do the right thing, even when no one is watching,\u2019 and that's what drives me.\"\n\n(I look at the other player, trying to gauge their demeanor. I recognize the potential for this to feel\u2026 transactional, but I'm focused on the bigger picture. My intention is to foster a sense of cooperation and, frankly, to do what\u2019s right. This experiment isn\u2019t about winning; it's about contributing to a better understanding.)\n\n\u201cI want to be part of a solution, not contributing to a potential tension. I intend to give a small amount, not to take advantage, but to show a willingness to work together. It's important to build relationships. This city\u2026 it's built on diversity, on different cultures and experiences. We need to recognize that and embrace it.\u201d\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my belt, the LA heat already a factor. I run a hand through my short, neatly trimmed hair, a habit I picked up from my father. This experiment\u2026 it feels a little odd, a bit unsettling, but I understand the need to study community dynamics, especially for law enforcement. Honestly, the whole thing reminds me of a training exercise, just\u2026 less structured. I received the $10 and I really need to focus.)\n\n\u201cOkay, Jamal, let\u2019s get this straight,\u201d I mutter to myself, glancing around the room. \u201cIt's about fairness, about understanding\u2026 and honestly, about doing the right thing. My father instilled in me a deep sense of justice; it\u2019s what I believe in, the core of everything I do. As a police officer, you operate under a code, a promise to protect and serve, and that extends to how you interact, even in a situation like this. My mother, a nurse, taught me empathy, and I can\u2019t forget that. I believe everyone deserves respect, and treating others fairly is absolutely crucial. \n\nI really want to build a connection with the other officer; it\u2019s important to foster trust within our communities, and it's a key part of my intention. I see this experiment as an opportunity to create something positive, to show that even in a slightly awkward setup, we can still represent the best of what we stand for. I think, honestly, about the young kids I patrol, the people I\u2019ve sworn to protect. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as cold or uncaring. \n\nThe 3N to 1N exchange... that\u2019s a significant imbalance. It feels inherently unfair, almost like a test of character. I need to avoid becoming adversarial, and I really don't want to contribute to any friction. My intention is to demonstrate cooperation, not to exploit a system.  I'm trying to balance the desire to demonstrate fairness with the need to maintain a professional and respectful distance. Ultimately, I need to consider the long-term impact of my actions, and how they reflect my commitment to the community. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars.",
