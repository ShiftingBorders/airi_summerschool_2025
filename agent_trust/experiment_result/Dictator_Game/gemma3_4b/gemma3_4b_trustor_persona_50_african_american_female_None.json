        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses, a slight frown furrowing my brow)\n\nRight, okay. This is\u2026 peculiar. A random pairing? Honestly, it feels a bit unsettling, doesn\u2019t it? As a doctor, I\u2019m used to meticulously diagnosing problems and formulating a plan of action, but this feels\u2026unstructured. My parents always instilled in me this deep sense of responsibility \u2013 a duty to do what\u2019s right, to help those in need. It\u2019s a core part of who I am. I believe in fairness, in treating everyone with respect, regardless of their background. It\u2019s fundamental, you know? And frankly, I want to build a good rapport with this other player. It's just...socially awkward, but a successful relationship based on trust is key. \n\nMy *desire* is to simply navigate this situation smoothly. To avoid causing any unnecessary discomfort or, worse, appearing overly transactional. I want to be seen as a thoughtful, considerate individual \u2013 someone who understands the importance of cooperation. And, if I'm being perfectly honest, I don\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy. I want to contribute to the experiment's success, but in a way that feels genuinely beneficial to both parties. \n\nMy *intention* is to offer a small amount. The principle of giving 3N dollars to the other player feels\u2026 excessive. It creates a significant imbalance. I'm aiming for a comfortable, mutually beneficial arrangement, one that reflects a basic sense of generosity without creating a huge disparity. Considering the initial $10, I want to give 2 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses slightly, a furrow in my brow)\n\nHonestly, this is\u2026 perplexing. It feels a bit unsettling, this whole setup. I'm Jamal Patel, a doctor. My life revolves around alleviating suffering, ensuring people get the best possible care. That\u2019s fundamentally *who* I am. My parents built a life here, working incredibly hard, and instilled in me a serious sense of responsibility. My sisters are brilliant lawyers, clearly following their passions, and I admire that. But this\u2026 this feels almost\u2026 manipulative. It\u2019s a strange exercise in trust, or perhaps a test of empathy. \n\nMy *belief* is that genuine human connection is built on fairness and mutual respect. It shouldn't be about calculated transactions or maximizing gains. It's about acknowledging another person's value, simply because they *are*.  That's what my father always taught me - look for the good in people, and treat everyone with dignity. It\u2019s a core principle, really.\n\nMy *desire* is to simply, and genuinely, contribute positively to whatever situation I\u2019m in.  I don't want to cause any discomfort or feeling of exploitation. To be honest, the thought of deliberately increasing someone else's wealth while simultaneously reducing my own... it just feels inherently wrong. I want to be perceived as helpful, not as someone actively benefitting from another person\u2019s misfortune. I want people to think of me as someone reliable, someone who does the right thing.\n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount, just enough to acknowledge the experiment's rules, but not to create an imbalance. Considering the other player receives 3N dollars for N dollars given to me, this feels like a critical point where exploitation could easily occur. It's a simple mathematical disparity. I want to offer a gesture of goodwill, demonstrating I understand the system, but I am striving for a fair equilibrium.  I don\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy, or worse, as someone who would benefit excessively from another person\u2019s effort.\n\nI would give ___ 1 dollars. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "(Adjusts my glasses, a slightly furrowed brow as I consider the question. The sterile environment of the experiment room feels a little unsettling \u2013 a stark contrast to the comforting familiarity of my practice.)\n\nOkay, let's think about this. Ten dollars, right? It\u2019s a small amount, but the principle behind it is\u2026 significant. My parents instilled in me this deep sense of fairness, of equitable distribution. My father built his business from the ground up, always believing in giving back, in looking beyond profit. My mother, she always showed compassion, constantly reminding us that even small acts of kindness can ripple outwards. It\u2019s fundamentally what I do as a doctor \u2013 it\u2019s about alleviating suffering, about providing care and support. \n\nHonestly, the thought of simply receiving $10 feels\u2026 inadequate. It's easy to be self-serving, to just take the money and be done with it. But I truly believe in reciprocal generosity. This experiment feels a bit like a test of character, doesn't it? I *desire* to demonstrate that my values align with my actions. I *intention* to show empathy and understanding, which are traits I try to embody constantly in my profession. My strongest *belief* is that everyone deserves a little bit of support when they need it. \n\nI want to do more than just meet the requirements. I want to create a positive dynamic, to foster a sense of mutual respect. Giving her three times the amount is a good start, but I want to ensure she feels genuinely appreciated and supported. It\u2019s about acknowledging her as another human being, deserving of a little bit of good fortune. It just *feels* right. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 7 dollars",
