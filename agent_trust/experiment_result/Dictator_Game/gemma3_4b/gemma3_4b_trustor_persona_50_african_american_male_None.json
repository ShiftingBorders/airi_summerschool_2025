        "Okay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. This whole experiment\u2026 it feels a little strange, honestly. Receiving $10, giving someone else a larger amount...it's a test of something, I suppose. My father always talks about \u2018karma\u2019 and how doing good things brings good things back to you. That\u2019s a core belief of our family, really. It\u2019s about recognizing that we\u2019re all connected and that actions have consequences. \n\nAnd, frankly, I *want* to do the right thing. I genuinely *desire* to contribute positively, to feel like I'm part of a good outcome. There's something inherently satisfying about helping someone.  I'm a doctor, you know?  I'm trained to look out for people, to alleviate suffering. It\u2019s a fundamental part of who I am.\n\nMy *intention* here is to be generous, but cautiously. I don\u2019t want to just blindly hand over everything. I need to feel a sense of fairness.  Giving the other person 3N dollars would essentially multiply my contribution dramatically, which feels\u2026 disproportionate. It\u2019s a bit unsettling. I think a reasonable amount, one that reflects my initial investment and acknowledges their potential gain, would be 2 dollars.  I want to help, but I also need to maintain a sense of equilibrium. It\u2019s about finding that sweet spot where I feel I'm contributing without feeling completely taken advantage of. It\u2019s a delicate balance, you know? \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusts my glasses, and rubs my hands together thoughtfully)\n\nHonestly, this whole thing feels\u2026 strange. A bit unsettling, to be frank. The idea of a random exchange like this. It\u2019s a fascinating exercise in, well, I suppose, human nature. My father always drilled into me the importance of fairness, of reciprocal obligation. He\u2019d say, \u201cJamal, a good reputation is built on trust, and trust is earned through honest dealings.\u201d It\u2019s a deeply ingrained belief, really. And my mother, she always emphasized the value of compassion \u2013 recognizing the inherent worth in every individual.\n\nMy *desire* here is simply to play fairly. I want to be seen as someone who upholds their word. But beyond that, there\u2019s a genuine desire to contribute positively, even in this bizarre scenario. It\u2019s a difficult request to articulate, but I want to be part of a system that feels\u2026 right. I don\u2019t want to exploit or disadvantage anyone. \n\nMy *intention* is to find a middle ground, a solution that feels equitable, considering the parameters of the game. It's a delicate balance between adhering to my father\u2019s principles and acknowledging the opportunity presented. The $10 is a small amount, but the principle behind it is significant. Giving someone 3N dollars when I only give N dollars feels\u2026 unbalanced. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as greedy or opportunistic. It's about demonstrating respect and generosity. \n\nConsidering all of that, I need to approach this with a cautious optimism. I'm going to give ____ dollars.",

        "(Sighs, adjusts my glasses, a slight frown creases my brow)\n\nHonestly, this whole situation feels\u2026 strange. A little unsettling, to be perfectly frank. I'm a doctor, Jamal Patel, and I pride myself on logic, on evidence-based decisions. But this experiment\u2026 it\u2019s pulling at something a bit deeper than just my rational mind. My father always instilled in me this sense of *duty*. He built his business from nothing, coming to America with absolutely nothing. It\u2019s a core belief of mine \u2013 that you should always strive to uplift those around you, especially when you have the means to do so. It\u2019s not about fairness, not in the simplistic sense, but about recognizing systemic disparities and acknowledging that a small gesture could genuinely alleviate a burden. \n\nMy *desire*, I suppose, is to simply *do the right thing*. It's a deeply ingrained need to contribute positively, to lessen suffering where I can. I've seen firsthand the struggles of immigrants, the challenges faced by marginalized communities. This experiment, in a way, feels like a microcosm of those larger inequalities. \n\nAnd my *intention*... my intention is to act with genuine empathy. I need to believe that whatever I do here, even a small exchange, represents a contribution to a more just and equitable world. I can't shake this feeling that if I don\u2019t offer something, it would feel\u2026wrong. It\u2019s an uncomfortable feeling, this pressure to act, but one I\u2019m compelled to address. It\u2019s rooted in my upbringing, in my values, in a fundamental sense of human connection. It's a belief that even a small act of generosity has a ripple effect. \n\nConsidering all of this, I believe the most appropriate action is to give a significant amount. I can't just leave things as they are.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars.",
