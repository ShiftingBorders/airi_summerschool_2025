        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses, a slight furrow in my brow)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. This whole experiment\u2026it feels a little strange, honestly.  Ten dollars, huh? It\u2019s not a huge sum, but the principle behind it is... interesting. My parents worked incredibly hard to build a life here, and my father instilled in me a real sense of responsibility, of fairness. It's a core belief of mine, really.  He always said, \"Don\u2019t take advantage of someone else\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d And, I genuinely believe in contributing, in doing what's right, even when it\u2019s not necessarily the easiest thing to do. \n\nI want to be helpful, absolutely. This feels like an opportunity to genuinely assist someone. My desire is to act with integrity, to support another person, even if the mechanics are a bit convoluted.  It\u2019s about demonstrating that inherent goodness. The thought of exploiting this system, of solely benefiting myself, it just...doesn\u2019t sit right. It\u2019s a conflict between the logical calculation \u2013 3N for me, N for them \u2013 and my deeply held moral compass. \n\nMy intention is to give a modest amount.  I wouldn't want to be overly generous, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be purely self-serving. The ideal scenario would be somewhere in the middle.  I\u2019m leaning towards giving 2 dollars. It feels like a respectful amount, a gesture of goodwill, without drastically altering the power dynamic. I want to feel good about the decision, you know? It's about recognizing the inherent worth in another human being. It's a small act, but it reflects my values. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusts my glasses, looking slightly perplexed)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s think about this calmly. Honestly, this whole experiment feels a little\u2026odd. A random pairing? Giving money based on a number? It's a bit unsettling, but I understand it\u2019s for research. My father always emphasized the importance of fairness and a good reputation \u2013 you have to always do the right thing, even when it's not immediately obvious. He built his business on trust, and I deeply respect that.\n\nMy *belief* is that cooperation and generosity are fundamental to a healthy society. It\u2019s about recognizing that everyone is vulnerable and that a little help can make a real difference. I truly believe in the inherent good in people, and this experiment, though strange, seems like an opportunity to demonstrate that. \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute positively to this situation, to feel like I\u2019m part of a productive exchange. It's not about winning or losing; it's about acting with integrity. I don't want to be seen as exploitative or greedy. I want to feel that I\u2019ve responded in a way that aligns with my values. \n\nMy *intention* is to give the other player enough to establish a reasonable balance. If I give nothing, it feels...cold. But giving too much would be almost arrogant. It\u2019s a delicate balance, isn\u2019t it? I want to do what\u2019s right, and it feels right to acknowledge the situation, to offer a small gesture of goodwill. I want to promote a sense of mutual respect.\n\nConsidering all this, I would give... 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusts my glasses, and stares thoughtfully at the table)\n\nOkay, okay. Let\u2019s think about this calmly. This whole situation is\u2026 unsettling, frankly. The random pairing, the money exchange... it feels a little precarious, doesn\u2019t it? My father always drilled into us the importance of fairness and integrity, you know? He built his business from the ground up, always emphasizing treating people with respect, doing what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s difficult. That\u2019s a core belief of mine, absolutely. And this experiment, while seemingly simple, it taps into that. \n\nHonestly, my *desire* is to ensure a just outcome. I don\u2019t want to feel like I'm exploiting anyone, or that I'm benefiting unfairly from this arrangement. It\u2019s a strange situation, offering someone three times the amount I give. It feels\u2026 disproportionate. That's what bothers me the most.  It feels almost manipulative. \n\nMy *intention* is to act with a level of balance, to find a comfortable equilibrium.  I know the study group wants us to observe behavioral patterns, but I want to demonstrate that I'm not going to just take advantage of this.  I need to project an image of someone who is responsible and considerate. I want to believe that I can contribute positively to this situation. I'm striving for a mutually beneficial arrangement, even if it seems a bit unbalanced. It\u2019s important to me to be seen as someone who acts with empathy. \n\nI\u2019m going to give 2 dollars. Finally, I will give 2 dollars",
