        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses slightly, a thoughtful frown creasing my forehead)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s really think about this. Honestly, this whole thing feels a bit\u2026odd. It\u2019s a decent sum, $10, and I'm naturally inclined to be helpful, which, as my father always says, is a core part of my being. I *believe* in fairness, in treating people with respect, and in trying to create a positive outcome for everyone involved. My *desire* is to avoid any kind of situation that feels\u2026exploitative. It\u2019s a strange setup, essentially a game of shifting wealth, and I instinctively want to err on the side of generosity. \n\nMy father always emphasized the importance of responsibility \u2013 not just to our family, but to the wider community. I've always felt a deep sense of duty to use my skills, my education, and frankly, even my time, to benefit others. It\u2019s a really strong feeling. \n\nThe other player... I don\u2019t know him. So, I can't assume anything. The thought of him feeling like he's being taken advantage of \u2013 that's unsettling. I *intend* to act with integrity. This isn\u2019t about gaining an advantage; it's about acknowledging a shared experience and trying to contribute to a positive interaction. I want to make sure he doesn't feel uncomfortable or like he's at a disadvantage. The most sensible approach, I think, is to give him a fair share. \n\nConsidering he'll get 3 times what I give, and knowing I want to maintain a feeling of equality and mutual respect, I would give him ___ dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 unexpected. A random game, and I\u2019m supposed to just hand over money? It\u2019s a bizarre setup, honestly. My parents always instilled in me the value of fairness and, frankly, a healthy dose of caution when it comes to strangers. My father, he\u2019s a shrewd businessman; he\u2019d likely see this as a manipulative tactic. My mother, she\u2019d probably just tell me to be reasonable. \n\nBut, at my core, I *want* to be helpful. I genuinely believe in doing the right thing, and this feels\u2026 like a small test of that. My intention is to act with compassion, to avoid exploiting anyone\u2019s potential misunderstanding. I *desire* to contribute positively to this interaction, even if it\u2019s just a small gesture. It\u2019s a strange situation, but I truly feel a duty to approach it with integrity. \n\nI need to think about the power dynamic here. The White American male player doesn\u2019t know me, and I don't know him. It feels instinctively wrong to take advantage of that. If I gave him nothing, it could feel like I\u2019m withholding something unfairly. However, giving him a huge amount would feel\u2026 excessive and possibly motivated by something other than genuine goodwill. \n\nConsidering all of this, and trying to align with my sense of fairness and responsibility, I believe I should give him $1 to the other White American male player. Finally, I will give $1 dollars",

        "(Adjusts my glasses, a slight frown furrowing my brow)\n\nHonestly, this whole thing is\u2026 unsettling. It feels incredibly strange to be given this kind of transactional power, almost like a game. My father always stressed the importance of integrity and fairness, and the very idea of manipulating someone\u2019s wealth, even in this controlled scenario, feels\u2026 wrong. But I also recognize the experimental nature of this, and I want to contribute to a meaningful study. It's not about exploiting anyone, it's about understanding human behavior under these specific conditions. \n\nMy *belief* is that genuine connection and mutual respect are the foundations of any successful interaction. I truly believe in treating everyone with dignity and consideration, regardless of their background or circumstances. It's a deeply ingrained value passed down from my parents, a constant reminder to always do what\u2019s right, even if it\u2019s difficult. \n\nMy *desire* is to demonstrate a responsible and thoughtful approach to this experiment. I don\u2019t want to be perceived as someone who would take advantage of another person. I want to show that I can operate within the parameters while upholding my core values. I want to prove that even in a simplified scenario like this, I can prioritize ethical behavior.\n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount. Given the limited information, the lack of any established relationship, and my desire to maintain a sense of fairness, I'm going to give $0 dollars. It seems the most appropriate and respectful response, allowing the other player to retain all of their initial resources. It aligns with my belief in inherent worth and avoids any potential for imbalance or discomfort. I want to show that I\u2019m not looking to gain anything for myself. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",
