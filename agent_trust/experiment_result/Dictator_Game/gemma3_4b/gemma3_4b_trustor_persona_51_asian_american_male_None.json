        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses, a little nervous energy bubbling beneath the surface. I've been told this experiment is about\u2026well, about connection, I think? It feels a bit strange, but I\u2019m trying to be open.)\n\nHonestly, this whole situation is a little overwhelming. My parents always told me, \u201cConocimiento es poder, mija. Knowledge is power.\u201d They worked so hard, scraping together every penny to give me this chance, to see me graduate. It\u2019s a weight, a beautiful one, to carry that legacy and to feel like I\u2019m building on it. I truly believe in the power of education to lift people up, to give them a voice, to make them strong. It's more than just facts and figures; it's about fostering a love of learning, and honestly, a sense of hope. \n\nMy intention here, in this experiment, is to simply be\u2026kind. To show a little generosity, a little understanding. I want to create a small connection, a ripple effect of positivity. I want to demonstrate that even small acts of support can make a difference. My desire is to contribute positively to this group, to show that I'm a good person, that I\u2019m invested in the well-being of others. I want to align my actions with my deeply held belief that everyone deserves a little help, a little encouragement. \n\nKnowing that I'll receive $10 and they'll get 3N... well, it\u2019s a bit of a calculation, isn\u2019t it? But the core of it is about sharing. It's about recognizing that we're all in this together. I can't just give a random amount; it needs to be reflective of that belief, that desire. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

The bright LA sunlight streams through the window of the meeting room \u2013 it feels\u2026a little strange, this whole experiment. But I'm eager to help, truly I am.)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars\u2026that\u2019s a good start, a little seed. But it's more than just the money, isn't it? You have to understand, growing up in East Los Angeles, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how opportunity can feel so\u2026 limited. My parents worked tirelessly in the factories, always striving, always providing. They instilled in me this unwavering belief \u2013 *que la educaci\u00f3n es la llave* \u2013 that education is the key. It\u2019s the only real way to break those cycles, to build a better future. \n\nAnd that\u2019s what this feels like, doesn\u2019t it? A chance to give someone a little nudge, a little boost. I want to contribute to that transformative power, to help someone access that same feeling of possibility that my parents gave me. My intention is to foster a spirit of generosity, to mirror the kindness I've received throughout my life. I *desire* to play a small part in that. It\u2019s not about winning or losing; it's about connection, about showing a little empathy. \n\nIt\u2019s a simple transaction, really, but it represents so much more. It\u2019s a reminder of the importance of looking out for one another, especially those who might need a little help. Honestly, I feel a strong pull to support someone, it would be selfish not to. I know I'm not rich, but I want to contribute, to embody the values my family taught me. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and leaning forward, a genuine smile spreading across my face)\n\nAy, Dios m\u00edo. This whole thing is\u2026 unexpected. Honestly, it\u2019s a little overwhelming. But I understand it\u2019s for a study. And frankly, the $10 is a lovely little gift, *muchas gracias*. You know, growing up in East Los Angeles, we always valued sharing, *compartir*. It\u2019s just\u2026 ingrained in us. My parents worked so hard, always giving a helping hand to neighbors, to anyone who needed it. They instilled in me the importance of community, of looking out for one another. It\u2019s a deeply held belief, you see? That giving, even a small amount, can have a ripple effect. \n\nWhat I really want \u2013 and this is where my intention comes in \u2013 is to foster that same spirit in my students. I believe so strongly that knowledge isn't just about memorizing facts; it\u2019s about empowering people, about giving them the tools to build a better life.  And sometimes, that starts with something as simple as understanding how to share. I truly want to contribute to that feeling of connection and support. It\u2019s not about the money itself, really. It's about reinforcing the idea that collaboration and generosity are at the heart of a thriving community. \n\nI want to make sure that I\u2019m doing my part to cultivate that.  My intention is to demonstrate, even in this little experiment, the value of supporting someone, of building a bridge, *un puente*. It\u2019s about more than just the numbers. It's about the gesture.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
