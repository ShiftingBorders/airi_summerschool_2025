        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and looking around the room with a gentle smile)\n\nOh, my goodness. This is\u2026 a little strange, isn't it? Honestly, this whole setup feels a bit like a dream. I\u2019m Maria Rodriguez, by the way. I teach tenth grade English here in Los Angeles. I\u2019ve spent the last fifteen years pouring my heart into these kids, really trying to show them that learning isn\u2019t just about grades \u2013 it\u2019s about *understanding*. It\u2019s about seeing the world through different eyes, you know? My *belief*, and it\u2019s a really deep one, is that knowledge truly *liberates* people. It gives them the tools to build a better future, not just for themselves, but for their families and communities. \n\n(I pause, considering the situation carefully. My family... my parents worked so hard in those factories, always striving for a little bit of a better life. I wanted to be the first, to show them that education *does* matter. It's a huge *desire* of mine to create that same opportunity for my students.  I see this experiment as an opportunity to connect, to genuinely help someone, especially someone who might not have the same kind of support that I've had.  My *intention* is to build a little bit of bridge here, to show empathy and generosity. I truly believe in fostering good will. \n\n(I tap my fingers thoughtfully on the table) \n\nWith just $10... it's a small amount, of course, but if I were to give some of it, I wouldn't just give it to be given back. I\u2019d give\u2026 I'd give 3 dollars. It's the smallest amount to truly express my intention. It\u2019s a simple gesture, a quiet acknowledgement of another human being\u2019s value. It's about acknowledging a shared humanity, and showing a little bit of grace. It\u2019s a little bit of hope, you know? It's about reminding myself and perhaps this other person that even small acts of kindness can make a difference. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and leaning forward slightly, a thoughtful frown creasing my brow. The light in my small classroom in East LA feels a little dimmer than it should, but my students \u2013 even this strange experiment \u2013 deserve my full attention.)\n\nHonestly, this feels\u2026 complicated. It's a strange situation, isn't it? Receiving ten dollars, and then this exchange\u2026 it makes me think about how we all build each other up, you know? My *belief* is so deeply rooted in the idea that everyone, *every single person*, has potential. It\u2019s like a little seed \u2013 you just need the right nurturing, the right support to help it grow. And I see this transaction as a small reflection of that. \n\nMy *desire* is to foster that belief in everyone around me.  I spent so many years seeing my family, working hard in those factories, sometimes feeling like their dreams were just\u2026distant. It was exhausting. I want my students to know they *can* achieve anything if they put their minds to it.  This experiment feels a little... uneven. It\u2019s not fair that he gets so much more than I do. \n\nMy *intention* is to act with a little kindness, a little generosity. Not because I think he *needs* the money, but because it feels right to share, to contribute to someone else\u2019s well-being. I want to offer a bit of balance, a little of the support I\u2019ve always tried to give. It wouldn't be enough to change the world, of course, but it's a small gesture. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ five dollars",

        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and looking thoughtfully at the instructions)\n\nOkay, okay. This is\u2026unexpected. A little unsettling, frankly. But I understand the study is about connection, about understanding different perspectives. Honestly, I\u2019m a little hesitant, but I want to be a good participant. My family, you know? My parents worked so hard, building a life, always striving. They instilled in me the importance of education, the *poder* \u2013 the power \u2013 of learning. It\u2019s not just about facts and figures; it\u2019s about opening doors, about breaking cycles, about creating a better future. I truly believe in that. \n\nThis whole arrangement... it feels a bit like a test of faith, really. I want to demonstrate my genuine willingness to connect, to understand. I don't want to just *take* money; I want to build something positive, even if it\u2019s just a small step. My intention is to show respect and empathy. My desire is to help create a scenario of mutual benefit, demonstrating my belief in the inherent goodness of people.
