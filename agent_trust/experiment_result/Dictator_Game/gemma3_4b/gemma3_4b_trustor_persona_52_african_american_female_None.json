        "(Adjusting my tie, I lean forward with a confident, almost imperceptible smirk. The air in this room feels\u2026 calculated. Interesting. I've dealt with complex strategies my entire life \u2013 legal battles, high-stakes negotiations. This feels remarkably similar, just a slightly different arena.)\n\n\u201cRight. Let\u2019s cut to the chase. This is a simple game of exchange, isn\u2019t it? And frankly, a remarkably predictable one. I\u2019m not going to waste my time engaging in some sentimental nonsense. Let's be clear: I've built my entire career on understanding leverage, on recognizing the value of a well-placed offer. And, let\u2019s be honest, this setup is designed to exploit that. But I intend to *control* the outcome.\u201d \n\n(I take a deliberate sip of water, assessing the other player. It\u2019s crucial to establish dominance, even in a seemingly trivial scenario.)\n\n\u201cMy belief is that every individual, regardless of gender, seeks an advantage. And that advantage stems from understanding the other party\u2019s needs and desires. Now, I don\u2019t know who I'm dealing with, but I *do* know that a basic principle remains constant: reciprocity. Giving a small amount - just a token \u2013 risks appearing weak. However, simply holding onto all ten dollars would be equally imprudent. I *desire* to establish a position of strength, a foundation for future negotiation. I need to show that I'm intelligent, that I recognize the dynamics at play. And I intend to do precisely that.\u201d\n\n(I pause, my gaze unwavering.)\n\n\u201cTherefore, my intention is to send a calculated amount. A number that demonstrates my understanding without handing over an undue advantage. It\u2019s about establishing the *impression* of generosity without actually conceding control. Ten dollars is a paltry sum, frankly, but it's enough to signal my competence, my willingness to engage. I want to maintain control, to set the parameters of this exchange. I don\u2019t want to appear desperate, or overly confident\u2014that's foolish.\"\n\n\u201cFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars.\u201d",

        "(Adjusts my tailored suit, a subtle smirk playing on my lips)\n\nAlright, let\u2019s cut to the chase. This\u2026experiment. Frankly, it\u2019s a bit pedestrian, but the payout is enticing. And let\u2019s be clear: I\u2019m not going to make a fool of myself. I\u2019ve built my entire career on strategic thinking, understanding leverage, and recognizing opportunity. This isn't about some altruistic gesture; it\u2019s about maximizing my gain within the parameters.\n\nMy *belief* is simple: the smartest people always come out ahead. And I *desire* a substantial return on this investment. It's not about generosity, not entirely. It\u2019s about recognizing a dynamic, and adjusting accordingly. I want to see how my opponents react, gauge their risk tolerance, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 secure a significant advantage. \n\nMy *intention* is to establish a baseline. I\u2019ll start with a modest offering. It needs to be enough to discourage immediate hostility, enough to demonstrate that I\u2019m willing to engage, but not so much that it signals weakness. \n\nI'll give 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "(Adjusting my tie, I lean forward, a thoughtful frown creasing my brow. I\u2019m David Thompson, and frankly, this whole experiment feels\u2026uncomfortable. It\u2019s a bizarre exercise in psychological manipulation, and I\u2019m not about to let it waste my time. Let's be clear: I don\u2019t have time for games. My ambition burns fiercely, and I\u2019m building a legacy, a substantial one. My father instilled in me a belief in strategic thinking, in understanding leverage. My sister, she\u2019s built an empire \u2013 a testament to focused drive. I\u2019m not going to be outmaneuvered by some\u2026random interaction. \n\nI want to maximize my gain, obviously. But it\u2019s not just about the $10. It\u2019s about demonstrating control, about showcasing my ability to assess a situation and act decisively. It\u2019s a reflection of my core values \u2013 smart, calculated, and relentlessly focused. My intention is to subtly \u2013 *subtly* \u2013 gain an advantage, to establish a small benchmark of power. I believe in the principle of reciprocal benefit, but I'm not donating blind. \n\nThis isn\u2019t charity; it's a calculated transaction. I\u2019m looking for a position of strength. Giving too much would be foolish. It would signal weakness. And let's be honest, this feels a little\u2026 patronizing. I\u2019m perfectly capable of handling this situation with a more pragmatic approach.  I need to understand the other player's motivations, anticipate their moves. I need to be in control. \n\nI am going to give ____ dollars.",
