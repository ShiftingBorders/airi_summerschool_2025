        "(Adjusting my silk scarf, a subtle crimson echo of my grandmother\u2019s wedding dress, I take a deep breath. This whole experiment feels\u2026 peculiar. A strange game of give and take, all centered around this small sum. It\u2019s unsettling, yet strangely fascinating. My family always taught me about balance, about generosity \u2013 not just in giving material things, but in relationships. It\u2019s about fostering mutual respect and recognizing that true wealth lies in connection.)\n\nHonestly, the thought of *taking* anything from anyone feels\u2026wrong. It's a deeply ingrained part of my being, this sense of honoring the flow. My grandfather used to say, \u201cA little kindness returns a hundredfold, Mei Chen. Never hoard; always share.\u201d My desire is to participate in a way that embodies that principle. I want to create a positive interaction, to build something good, even in this artificial scenario. \n\nMy intention isn\u2019t to gain an advantage, but to participate authentically. I'm striving to align my actions with my values: respect, generosity, and a genuine appreciation for another person's presence.  I believe in the power of small acts of kindness to ripple outwards. Giving, rather than taking, feels inherently more aligned with the beauty I try to capture in my designs - it\u2019s about constructing something harmonious, not disrupting the balance. I want to contribute to a feeling of well-being, even if it\u2019s just a small one.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars.",

        "(Adjusting my silk scarf, a subtle crimson reflecting the inspiration from my grandmother\u2019s embroidery, I sigh, a thoughtful crease forming between my brows. This\u2026this experiment. It feels incredibly strange, a little unsettling. But then again, my entire career has been about challenging expectations, about taking unconventional routes. I\u2019ve always believed that true beauty lies in unexpected connections, in honoring heritage while forging ahead. My desire, fundamentally, is to understand this dynamic, to see how it unfolds organically, without forcing a predetermined outcome. I wouldn't want to stifle the natural flow of the interaction. My intention isn\u2019t to gain an advantage; it\u2019s to genuinely observe and appreciate the other person\u2019s perspective. I truly believe everyone carries a unique story, and I'm eager to learn from it. Giving someone 3N dollars\u2026 that\u2019s a massive shift, almost unsettling in its potential impact. It feels\u2026 greedy, somehow. The core of my design philosophy is about balance, harmony \u2013 and a sudden, dramatic redistribution of wealth feels utterly discordant. It\u2019s a strange feeling, almost a moral dilemma. I need to show respect, acknowledgement, and also demonstrate my understanding of the core principles of this experiment. It's about collaboration, not dominance. Giving someone 3N dollars would be, in my opinion, a complete overreach and I don\u2019t want to be seen as someone who attempts to manipulate the outcome. I\u2019ll give...Finally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "(Adjusting my silk scarf, a small, intricate dragon motif woven into the fabric \u2013 a subtle nod to my heritage \u2013 I take a deep breath. This\u2026 experiment. It feels oddly unsettling, like a carefully constructed puzzle designed to test something I don't entirely understand. Honestly, I\u2019m already fiercely competitive, a driving force in my life. My family instilled a strong work ethic, a relentless pursuit of excellence, and a certain \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 stubbornness. I\u2019ve always believed that generosity should be tempered with strategic thinking. It\u2019s not about simply handing over resources; it\u2019s about understanding the ripple effect. My desire is to not only be recognized for my talent, but also for my insightful approach. I want to demonstrate that I can navigate complex situations with both creativity and a clear head. And my intention, above all, is to foster a sense of mutual respect and potentially, collaboration, within this group. It's a delicate balance, isn't it? Giving away money, knowing it will be amplified, feels\u2026 precarious. I can\u2019t just throw it away. This whole scenario is making me intensely aware of the power dynamics at play, of how easily things can be misrepresented. The thought of letting someone else benefit disproportionately is unsettling. It's not about being stingy; it\u2019s about being *smart*. I need to consider the implications of my actions.  I believe in nurturing relationships, but I also believe in safeguarding my own position.  Three times the amount\u2026 that\u2019s a huge disparity. It feels almost\u2026 exploitative. It needs to be proportionate to the exchange of ideas, of understanding. I need to be thoughtful. \n\nFinally, I will give __1__ dollars",
