        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Just got the notification I\u2019m part of this experiment and I\u2019ve been given $10. Honestly, a little unsettling, but also kind of fascinating. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, by the way \u2013 28, software engineer, and I *hate* feeling like I'm being manipulated. This whole thing feels a bit like a test of my instincts, and frankly, I'm not going to let someone else dictate my actions. \n\nMy belief is that fairness is paramount, even in a situation like this. I don\u2019t want to contribute to some kind of predetermined outcome, whatever that might be. I believe in looking out for others, but only when it feels genuine, not forced. I\u2019ve seen enough systemic inequalities in the tech world \u2013 it feels wrong to potentially reinforce them through a game. \n\nMy desire is to be seen as someone who is intelligent, considerate, and not easily swayed. I want to demonstrate that I can make a rational decision based on the information available, without any underlying bias or pressure. It's important to me that I'm perceived as a strategic thinker. \n\nMy intention is to give the other player a small amount of money, just enough to acknowledge the interaction without significantly altering the balance of power. This isn't about winning or losing; it\u2019s about demonstrating a quiet, thoughtful approach. I'm aiming for a level of reciprocity \u2013 a gesture of goodwill without creating a dependency. It's crucial for me to retain control of my own actions and avoid feeling like a pawn.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American female player, and the African American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 unexpected. A random experiment with another Black woman? Honestly, it feels a little strange, but also kind of fascinating. My parents always told me to be strategic, to look for opportunities, and to build strong relationships \u2013 so I'm going to approach this with a bit of calculated thought, honestly. \n\nIt's important to me to be seen as fair, and hardworking. I've always been driven to succeed, to prove myself, especially given the systemic barriers people like me sometimes face. My ambition is huge, I really want to climb the ladder in my field, and this feels like a tiny little test of that - a test of whether I\u2019m willing to invest in collaboration. I don't want to come across as greedy or uncooperative. It's a delicate balance, isn't it? I definitely don't want to be perceived as someone who would take advantage of another woman. \n\nMy belief is that genuine connection and mutual support are essential for success, particularly within our community. I want to contribute positively to this experiment, not just to passively receive. My desire is to build a bridge, to foster a sense of solidarity. It's not about winning or losing; it's about demonstrating a willingness to help another woman succeed. \n\nMy intention is to give a small, thoughtful amount, one that feels generous without being overwhelming. I'm thinking about what a productive investment would be. Three times the amount I receive is a significant shift, so I want to offer something to show goodwill. I\u2019m going to be thoughtful about this, and the amount represents a reasonable gesture of support. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Honestly, I\u2019m a bit thrown. A random experiment with another Black woman? It feels\u2026 significant, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, by the way, and I'm trying to keep a cool head. This whole thing feels a little weird, like a social experiment magnified.  My parents always drilled into me the importance of fairness and looking out for people, especially within our community. They stressed the value of collective uplift, especially for Black women. And honestly, just thinking about it makes me feel a responsibility.\n\nMy *belief* is that this isn't just some abstract game. It\u2019s a chance to actually *do* something, even if it's small. I believe in the power of a genuine act of generosity, especially when it comes to supporting someone who shares a similar background and experiences as me. It feels, deep down, like a reflection of a much larger struggle \u2013 a need for solidarity and mutual support.\n\nMy *desire* is to feel like I'm contributing to a positive outcome, not just playing a game. I want to contribute to a ripple effect of kindness. I\u2019ve always been driven to excel, to be good at what I do\u2014my career is everything\u2014but lately, I\u2019ve been realizing that success isn\u2019t just about individual achievement. It's about using my resources, even small ones, to help others. I want to feel *useful*.\n\nMy *intention* is to give a significant amount to the other player. The initial $10 is just a starting point. I want to signal that I'm invested in this interaction, that I recognize the shared space we occupy. I don't want to just randomly throw some money around; I want to show an acknowledgement of her existence and a willingness to support her. It\u2019s a bit awkward, I'll admit, but in a way, it\u2019s empowering. I need to build a connection with her. \n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars.",
