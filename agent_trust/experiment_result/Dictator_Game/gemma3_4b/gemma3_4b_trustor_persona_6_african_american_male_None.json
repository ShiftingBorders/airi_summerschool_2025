        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026strange. Ten dollars. Just like that? Honestly, it feels a little unsettling, but also\u2026 intriguing. My parents always drilled into me the importance of strategic thinking, of understanding opportunity and risk. They both stressed the value of fairness, of course, but also the importance of recognizing when a situation presents a genuine advantage, even if it feels a bit uncomfortable. My ambition, you know? I'm not someone who sits back. I want to *win*, not just participate. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest, this whole experiment feels a bit\u2026 rigged. A random pairing with another African American male player? It brings up a whole host of unconscious biases, doesn\u2019t it? I'm actively trying to avoid contributing to any of that. I absolutely *don't* want to perpetuate any stereotypes or assumptions. My desire is to demonstrate my intelligence and my capacity for logical thought, while simultaneously being mindful and respectful. It\u2019s a delicate balance. \n\nMy intention here is to ensure a relatively equitable outcome. Giving him 3N dollars when I receive N feels like a blatant imbalance. It\u2019s almost\u2026 predatory. I'm not going to contribute to a dynamic that feels exploitative, even if it's just in this small game. It feels wrong to amplify any potential advantage I might have simply because of our shared background. My belief is that fairness requires a thoughtful approach, even when the situation seems unbalanced. I want to show I'm level-headed and strategic.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Seriously, just ten dollars? It feels a little strange, like a really weird game. My parents always drilled into me the importance of careful investment and strategic thinking, and honestly, ten dollars doesn\u2019t feel like a scenario that warrants a huge gamble. But, I also recognize the potential. This whole experiment... it feels a little like a test of something - probably social dynamics, maybe even biases. My ambition, you know? I *need* to succeed, to prove myself, especially as a woman in this field. It\u2019s not just about the money, it\u2019s about demonstrating I can handle complex situations, predict outcomes, and make smart decisions, even when things are a little\u2026unconventional.\n\nMy *belief* is that understanding this interaction, this power dynamic, will give me a better grasp of how systems, even seemingly simple ones, operate \u2013 how people respond to incentives, how power shifts. My *desire* is to show that I can analyze this situation effectively and potentially maximize my gains, not because I\u2019m greedy, but because I want to learn and demonstrate my capabilities. I want to prove I'm capable of understanding and mastering any situation. This feels like an opportunity to sharpen my problem-solving skills, just like I do at work. \n\nMy *intention* is to be thoughtful and rational. Giving a small amount \u2013 just enough to acknowledge the potential for a reciprocal exchange, but not so much that I\u2019m completely reliant on the other person. I need to control the narrative, to show a degree of influence. Giving zero dollars would feel passive.  Giving a large amount would feel overly reliant. This is about calculated generosity, a minimal investment designed to ensure I benefit while also demonstrating fairness. It aligns with the values my parents instilled in me - responsibility and a good return on investment.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 1 dollar.",

        "Okay, wow. This is\u2026 intense. Honestly, it feels a little bizarre, like a weird social experiment. I\u2019m Sarah Johnson, 28, software engineer, and I've been told I'm supposed to be part of this game? Ten dollars to start? It\u2019s a little awkward, to be honest. My parents always drilled into me the importance of fairness and, you know, *thinking* before acting. I\u2019m a logical person \u2013 I build software, I break down problems \u2013 so this feels like a puzzle I need to solve, but a social one.\n\nMy desire, frankly, is to actually *win* this. Not just for the money, though that would be nice. It\u2019s more about proving to myself that I can handle this situation strategically. I really want to show myself that I can be smart and resourceful. I've worked so hard to get where I am, and I don't want to mess this up. \n\nMy belief is that if I just give him everything, he\u2019ll take advantage of me. That's just not how the world works, right? I\u2019ve seen it happen \u2013 people using their advantage to exploit others. I\u2019m wary. And looking at the setup, I\u2019m reasonably sure this isn\u2019t about simple altruism. There\u2019s a game here.\n\nMy intention is to find a balance. I don\u2019t want to be seen as the pushover, but I also don't want to be seen as greedy or manipulative. I need to appear intelligent, aware, and cautious. The 3N ratio is incredibly one-sided, and frankly, it\u2019s uncomfortable. I'm thinking about how I would act if this was a real-life business scenario.\n\nI\u2019m going to play it cool. I'm going to give him a small amount, just enough to establish a baseline and show a little generosity, but not enough to drastically shift the power dynamic. The point is to maintain control.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",
