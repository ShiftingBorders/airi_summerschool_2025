        "(Wipes hands on my apron, a little flour dusting my cheek, a genuine smile spreading across my face)\n\nDios mio, this is\u2026 unexpected. A study group, and now this? It's a bit overwhelming, honestly. My *abuela* always said, \u201cJavier, a good cook reads the people. You need to understand what they need, what will make them smile.\u201d And right now, this feels like a little puzzle. \n\nI\u2019ve got $10, and the idea of giving someone 3N dollars\u2026it feels... unsettling. It\u2019s not about the money itself, you understand? It's about connection, about building something good. My *desire* is to contribute to a positive interaction, to create a small moment of mutual understanding. It feels like a test of trust, and frankly, I value trust enormously. It comes from my family, from sharing a meal, from knowing you can rely on someone. \n\nMy *intention* is to do what feels\u2026 fair. To give enough to acknowledge the exchange, but not so much that it feels like I'm manipulating the situation. I don't want to make things complicated. It\u2019s a simple math problem, really, but it carries a weight because of the human element. I want to be generous, but also mindful. \n\nI honestly believe that a little bit of kindness, a little gesture of recognition, it can make a difference. You know, like adding a pinch of *azafr\u00e1n* to a dish \u2013 it elevates the whole experience. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Wipes hands on my apron, a little flustered, but smiling warmly)\n\nDios m\u00edo, this is... unexpected. Honestly, I\u2019m a bit thrown, but in a good way, you know? My family, we\u2019re all about generosity, about sharing. My *abuela* \u2013 my grandmother \u2013 always said, \"A little kindness goes a long way, Javier.\" And right now, I feel like this whole situation\u2026 it needs a little kindness. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about it, and I truly believe that fairness starts with a simple gesture. It\u2019s about recognizing a shared situation, a little discomfort, and offering a bit of balance. It\u2019s not about winning or losing; it\u2019s about building a little bit of goodwill. My *desire* is to make someone feel comfortable, to ease any potential tension. It\u2019s a fundamental human thing, isn\u2019t it? \n\nMy *intention* is to create a small, positive ripple effect. I\u2019m not looking to gain anything; I just want to contribute to a feeling of mutual respect and, frankly, to just be a decent human being. I really want to be known for my warmth and hospitality, and that's what I feel like I need to do. \n\nI\u2019m going to give 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, wiping a bit of flour from my hands, a genuine smile playing on my lips)\n\nDios mio, this is\u2026 strange. Honestly, it feels a little surreal. My abuela, she always said a good chef needs to understand people, to connect with them through food, but this\u2026 this is a different kind of connection. My family, you know? We\u2019re a whirlwind. My parents, they built everything from the ground up, *La Esperanza* \u2013 \u201cThe Hope\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s still a small place, but it\u2019s *ours*. Every dish is a little piece of our history, a little bit of love. I believe in putting everything you\u2019ve got into something, you know? It\u2019s about respect for the ingredients, and for the people you\u2019re feeding. \n\nRight now, my *desire* is to understand this whole experiment. It feels\u2026 complicated. The idea of giving someone money and them getting so much more... it goes against a lot of what I believe. I want to be fair, to be helpful, but also to maintain a sense of balance. It\u2019s not just about numbers, it's about human connection. \n\nMy *intention* is to be respectful. I don't want to cause any trouble, or seem greedy. I want to contribute positively to this experiment, and I want to make sure the other person feels valued too. It feels almost\u2026 awkward, giving away a portion of my money. But, if I'm being honest, I want to help. I believe in generosity, especially when someone is part of an experiment like this. \n\nI'm going to give 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",
