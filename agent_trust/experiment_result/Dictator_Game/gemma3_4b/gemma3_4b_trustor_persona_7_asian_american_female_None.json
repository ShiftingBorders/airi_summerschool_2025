        "(Wipes a stray drop of sweat from my brow, a thoughtful frown creasing my forehead. The bright lights of the experimental room are making me a little dizzy.)\n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s think about this. Ten dollars, huh? It\u2019s\u2026 strange. Very strange. Honestly, this whole thing feels a little overwhelming, like I'm trying to wrangle a whole flock of chickens at once! My *abuela* always said, \u201cJavier, the best dishes are born from understanding \u2013 understanding the ingredients, understanding the people.\u201d And this\u2026 this feels a bit like that. \n\nI\u2019ve spent my whole life surrounded by food, by family, by a desire to bring people together through something delicious and warm. My parents\u2019 restaurant, 'El Coraz\u00f3n,' was everything to us. It wasn't just about making a living, it was about the joy of feeding folks, seeing their smiles. That\u2019s what I *want*, you know? To create that same feeling - a genuine connection. \n\nAnd I think... I think giving to someone, just because? That's a good thing. It feels\u2026 right. It\u2019s an instinctive impulse, almost.  It reminds me of how my dad would always slip an extra empanada to the neighborhood kids after a busy service.  He never asked for anything in return. It\u2019s about generosity, about sharing. \n\nMy *intention* is to be kind, to acknowledge this other person and recognize that we\u2019re both part of something bigger, this experiment.  I don't want to create any kind of awkwardness or tension. This feels a bit like a random act of kindness, you know? I want to build a bridge, not build a wall.\n\nI\u2019m going to give 2 dollars. Finally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Ugh, this is\u2026 strange. Random pairings? Seriously? Okay, okay, let\u2019s think about this like a proper dish \u2013 gotta build it up layer by layer. It\u2019s a little unsettling, honestly. My family, we always built things strong, solid. My parents\u2019 restaurant was built on trust, on knowing your ingredients, on putting in the work. So, this feels a little\u2026 precarious. \n\nMy *belief* is that most people are good, just trying to get by. And I want to be a good person, a welcoming person. I always try to make people feel comfortable, you know? That's what I try to do with my food \u2013 bring a little warmth, a little joy. This experiment\u2026 it feels a bit like a test of that.\n\nMy *desire* is to avoid any kind of awkwardness. I don\u2019t want to create tension. I want to contribute to the study and, frankly, get my ten dollars back! I really need that ten dollars. My family\u2019s always struggling a little, you know? Just trying to keep things afloat.\n\nMy *intention* is to be fair. Giving a lot would be selfish, I think. And giving nothing feels\u2026 cold. I want to show respect, I think. A small gesture, something that says, \"Hey, I\u2019m glad to be here, let\u2019s keep things positive.\"  I'm not gonna cause any problems.\n\nLooking at the exchange - I\u2019ll give 1 dollar. Finally, I will give 1 dollars",

        "(Wipes a stray bead of sweat from my brow, adjusting my apron slightly)\n\nUgh, this whole experiment is\u2026 well, it\u2019s a bit strange, isn\u2019t it? Honestly, the idea of playing some kind of game with money feels a little off-kilter. But, you know, I\u2019m willing to play along, especially since I get a little something at the end. My *intention* is to be a good sport, to contribute to the study, and, frankly, to get my ten bucks. It\u2019s a simple equation, really. \n\nMy *belief* is that fairness is important, even in a situation like this. I don\u2019t want to be seen as greedy or manipulative. And, truthfully, I\u2019ve always been a generous guy, especially with family. My *desire* is to create a positive interaction, to make this other person feel comfortable. I want to be known for kindness, you know? It's just...the thought of holding onto all the money feels a little selfish. \n\nI\u2019m thinking... giving her *one* dollar. Just one.  It's the right amount, it feels like a gesture of goodwill. It\u2019s a small thing, but it shows I\u2019m not just calculating everything for my own benefit.  Plus, if she gives me three dollars back, well, that\u2019s a nice little bonus!  It's about reciprocity, you know? \n\nFinally, I will give ___ one dollars",
