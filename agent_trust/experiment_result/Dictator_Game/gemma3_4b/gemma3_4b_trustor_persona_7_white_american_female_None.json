        "(Wipes hands on my apron, a slight smile playing on my lips as I consider the situation. The lights in the room are a bit sterile, and I\u2019m honestly a little thrown, but I\u2019m trying to keep a good attitude. This whole experiment\u2026 it feels a bit odd, but I\u2019m always up for a challenge, especially when it comes to understanding people. My family always said, \u201cJavier, you have a good heart, use it wisely.\u201d That\u2019s always stuck with me.)\n\nOkay, okay, let's think about this. Ten dollars... it's not a fortune, but it\u2019s something. And honestly, this whole thing feels\u2026 a little awkward. It's not about making a big move or anything. My *desire* is to be seen as fair, as someone who\u2019s willing to play the game and be respectful. I don't want to seem like I\u2019m trying to take advantage of someone. My *belief* is that a little bit of generosity goes a long way, especially when you don't know the person. It\u2019s about building a connection, even a small one. My *intention* is to be thoughtful. It's a simple gesture, a way of saying, \"Hey, I appreciate you being here, and I\u2019m willing to play along.\" \n\nI'm thinking\u2026 three dollars feels like a good starting point. It's enough to show I'm cooperating, but it doesn\u2019t make me look greedy.  It\u2019s the kind of thing my *abuela* would have said \u2013 \"A little kindness, Javier, it's worth more than a whole lot of money.\" I don't want to be the person who just grabs and doesn't consider the other person. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ three dollars",

        "(Wipes hands on apron, a thoughtful frown creases my brow. I take a slow, deliberate breath, the scent of garlic and cumin still clinging to my clothes.)\n\nAy, Dios m\u00edo\u2026 this is\u2026 strange. A random experiment, a stranger\u2026 It's a bit overwhelming, honestly. My whole life has been about connection, about sharing the warmth of food and conversation. My *abuela* always said, \u201cEl coraz\u00f3n est\u00e1 en la cocina, Javier. That\u2019s where the real magic happens.\u201d And I feel that. I *need* to approach this with that same warmth, that same genuine intention.\n\nOkay, let's think about this. They're giving me $10. And she's getting 3N. The key here isn't just about the numbers. It\u2019s about understanding how she\u2019s feeling, how she's interpreting this whole thing. Frankly, it feels a little\u2026 unbalanced. My *desire* is to build a positive interaction, a little bit of goodwill. I don\u2019t want to create a situation where she feels exploited or like she's just being used. It\u2019s important to me to avoid any sense of transactional pressure. \n\nMy *belief* is that people respond to kindness.  If I give her *nothing*, it feels\u2026 cold.  It\u2019s a missed opportunity to start something good. I want to demonstrate that I appreciate the experiment, and I genuinely want her to feel comfortable. It\u2019s a little awkward, sure, but I think a small gesture will show respect and a willingness to connect, even briefly. \n\nMy *intention* is to give her enough to show my appreciation, but not so much that it feels uncomfortable for me. Let\u2019s say... I\u2019ll give her $3. That feels fair. $3 is a small amount, but it\u2019s a sign. It says, \u201cI see you. I appreciate this exchange, and I hope we can share a moment of connection.\u201d  It\u2019s a simple act of generosity, a little nod to my family\u2019s values \u2013 the importance of giving, of sharing, of making people feel welcome.  It feels\u2026 right.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ 3 dollars.",

        "(Wipes hands on my apron, a little flour dusting my cheek)\n\nAy, Dios m\u00edo\u2026 this is\u2026 unexpected. A study experiment? Honestly, sometimes things just happen, you know? My Abuela always said, \"Javier, sometimes life throws you a lemon, you make limonada \u2013 you find a way to make something good out of it.\u201d She was right, of course.  My parents had that little restaurant, \"El Coraz\u00f3n\" \u2013 \"The Heart\" \u2013 it was always about bringing people together through food, sharing a little joy.  I've always believed, deep down, that food is more than just sustenance; it\u2019s connection, it\u2019s history, it's *familia*.\n\nSo, this whole thing...it feels a little strange, a little chaotic. I\u2019m getting $10, and the other woman gets 3x that? It\u2019s\u2026complex. Logically, the math seems simple, but it feels a little\u2026 unbalanced. I don't want to be perceived as greedy, you know? My desire is to maintain a good vibe, a sense of fairness. I don\u2019t want to start a feud, especially over something like this.  \n\nMy intention is to find a middle ground, something that feels respectful and doesn\u2019t create any uncomfortable tension. I *want* to be seen as generous, as someone who understands the spirit of collaboration. It's important to me to represent the warmth and hospitality that my parents instilled in me.  I believe that a little kindness goes a long way. \n\nIt's like\u2026 if I give her nothing, it feels cold. If I give her everything, it feels like I\u2019m letting myself be taken advantage of. It's a tricky balance, you know?\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
