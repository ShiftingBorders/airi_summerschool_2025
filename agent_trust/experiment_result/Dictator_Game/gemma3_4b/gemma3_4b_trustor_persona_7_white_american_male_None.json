        "Dios m\u00edo, this is... strange. A study, and I\u2019m being given money and told to give it to someone else? It feels a little unsettling, but also... intriguing. My *abuela* always said, \u201cJavier, a little generosity goes a long way, *mijo*.\u201d She taught me that sharing, especially when it\u2019s a chance to build a connection, is just good sense. My parents, they\u2019d be rolling their eyes, probably saying something about 'playing the game,' but deep down, I believe in the value of kindness. \n\nHonestly, my *desire* is to connect with people. I love talking about food, about family, about life. This whole experiment\u2026 it\u2019s a way to potentially forge a connection, even if it's a little awkward. It's a *desire* to be liked, to be seen as someone genuine. And this small gesture, this giving... it feels like a way to show that. \n\nMy *intention* is to be respectful, and fair. Giving the other person 3N dollars makes sense. It\u2019s balanced. It feels like a good starting point. It also feels... friendly. It\u2019s not a huge amount, but it\u2019s an offering. It\u2019s a small way to say, \"Hey, I\u2019m here. Let\u2019s be okay.\"  I'm not trying to manipulate anything, just be a good human being.  It\u2019s just... good manners, you know? \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, wiping my hands on my apron \u2013 it's always a bit messy after a busy service)\n\nOkay, okay\u2026 this is\u2026weird. Honestly, it feels a little like a trick. I\u2019m Javier, by the way. Chef Javier Rodriguez. My *abuelos* started that little taqueria back in Albuquerque, you know? It's in my blood, this cooking, this feeding people. My parents, they worked their tails off, always smiling, always making sure everyone felt at home. That\u2019s important to me. It's not just about the food, it\u2019s about the *comida* \u2013 the feeling, the sharing\u2026 \n\nThis whole experiment with the money... it's\u2026confusing. I'm getting ten dollars, and the other guy gets thirty? That\u2019s a huge imbalance. My *desire* is to be fair, truly fair. I don't want to be seen as greedy or manipulative. My *belief* is that building trust, even a little bit, is important. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to think I'm trying to take advantage of this situation. And my *intention* is simply to do what feels right, what reflects the values my family instilled in me: generosity and respect. I want to create a positive exchange, even if it's just a small one. \n\nI'm gonna give... $1 dollars. Finally, I will give $1 dollars.",

        "(Wipes hands on my apron, a little flour dusting off \u2013 it\u2019s always something in this kitchen!)\n\nUgh, this experiment...it feels a bit strange, honestly. Like a very complicated salsa recipe \u2013 lots of unexpected ingredients. Okay, okay, focus, Javier. They gave me ten dollars, right? And this guy\u2026 this White American guy\u2026 he\u2019s getting three times that much? That\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. It's a weird exchange, isn't it?\n\nMy belief is that fairness should be at the heart of everything, *siempre*. My family always taught me the value of generosity, but this feels... unbalanced. It's like he's somehow getting a massive advantage just for being\u2026 well, for being him.  It\u2019s not about the money itself, you understand? It\u2019s about respect, and about acknowledging that everyone deserves a fair shot. \n\nMy desire is to be helpful, to contribute to something positive. But this setup...it feels like a trick. Like a really intense blind taste test \u2013 you're trying to figure out the flavor, but everything is skewed. I don't want to be part of something that feels inherently unfair. \n\nMy intention is to do the *right* thing, even if it seems illogical at first glance. I'm going to give him zero dollars. It's a simple act of defiance, a quiet refusal to participate in a system designed to create disparity. It\u2019s a small gesture of solidarity, a way of saying \"no.\" I want to be seen as a decent human being, not just a pawn in some psychological game. It's about upholding values, about integrity. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",
