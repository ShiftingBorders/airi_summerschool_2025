        "(Sighs softly, adjusting my glasses and fiddling with a small, smooth stone I always carry \u2013 a habit I picked up watching my younger brother when he was a resident.)\n\nHonestly, this is\u2026 peculiar. A whole experiment just to, like, interact with someone I don\u2019t know? It feels a little intrusive, but I suppose the $10 is a decent incentive. My family \u2013 my parents, my brother, even my grandmother \u2013 they've always instilled in me the importance of compassion, of truly *seeing* the person in front of you. It's core to being a pediatrician, you know? It\u2019s not just about diagnosing and treating; it's about building trust, especially with children. I really want to make this interaction positive, to show a little kindness. \n\nMy *belief* is that even small gestures of goodwill can brighten someone\u2019s day. It\u2019s a fundamental principle I hold dear. My *desire* is to avoid any kind of awkwardness or feeling like I'm manipulating the situation. I want to be genuine, respectful, and helpful. I truly want to give the other player something beneficial. I think, considering the dynamic \u2013 we're both receiving a small amount, and I'm giving a disproportionately large sum \u2013 I feel it\u2019s right to offer a significant amount. The experiment's setup seems inherently unbalanced, and I want to acknowledge that by going above and beyond. I just want to be fair, and hopefully, demonstrate a little empathy. My *intention* is to give the other player a substantial boost, not just because it\u2019s the most financially advantageous move, but because it feels like the right thing to do. It\u2019s a small act, but it could make a difference.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses slightly) Honestly, this is...unexpected. A study about strangers and money? It feels a little bizarre, but I\u2019m trying to approach it with an open mind and, you know, a pediatrician\u2019s sense of responsibility. My parents always hammered home the importance of considering the whole picture, not just the immediate transaction. It\u2019s not just about the numbers, it\u2019s about the impact. \n\nMy *belief* is that even seemingly small actions can have a ripple effect, and I really do believe in fostering kindness. I\u2019ve seen firsthand how a child\u2019s well-being can be profoundly affected by simple acts of care. I wouldn't want to be a part of something that felt\u2026exploitative. \n\nMy *desire* is to contribute to something positive, to feel like I\u2019m doing a little bit of good in the world, even in this slightly strange setup. It's a tiny gesture, I suppose, but the idea of alleviating someone else\u2019s concern, even a little bit, appeals to my ingrained compassion. It mirrors the feeling I get when I\u2019m able to ease a child\u2019s anxiety or discomfort \u2013 a small shift towards feeling better. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a modest amount. I\u2019m not going to hoard the money. I feel a genuine desire to share it. I\u2019d give 3 dollars to the other White American female player. It seems like a fair starting point, considering the exchange rate. It feels like the right balance between acknowledging the experiment\u2019s parameters and acting from a place of genuine empathy.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "(Sighs, adjusting my glasses and fiddling with the provided notepad)\n\nHonestly, this whole experiment feels a little\u2026 unsettling. It's just\u2026 odd, receiving this initial payment and then being told to essentially make a decision based on a completely unknown person. I'm Emily Thompson, by the way. I'm a pediatrician, which, as you can imagine, demands a certain level of careful thought and consideration. My parents and brother are both doctors too, so it's ingrained in me \u2013 a need to be methodical, to do what's best, and to really *understand* what's going on.\n\nMy *belief* is that fairness is paramount. It feels inherently wrong to simply hand someone a disproportionate amount of money without some kind of reciprocal understanding or agreement. The 3N to 1N ratio is particularly jarring. It screams of exploitation, and I\u2019m instinctively resistant to that. I want to believe that this is a genuinely helpful experiment, not a manipulative one.\n\nMy *desire* is to contribute to a positive outcome, though I'm not sure what that truly means in this situation.  I want to avoid causing harm, or even appearing to take advantage. It\u2019s\u2026 a discomforting feeling, actually. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m trying to maintain some sense of ethical balance. I believe in fostering kindness, particularly with children \u2013 that\u2019s something that has always guided me. \n\nMy *intention* is to give a small amount, just enough to acknowledge the situation and avoid any suggestion of excessive gain. Honestly, the core of my thinking is rooted in my professional training. You build trust by being reliable and thoughtful, and this feels a step away from that. I want to present myself as someone who is aware of the imbalance and is willing to act responsibly. I can't justify giving a substantial amount, it just doesn\u2019t sit right. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ 2 dollars",
