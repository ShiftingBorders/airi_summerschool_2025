        "Well, I'm sitting here with this stranger across from me, not knowing who they are or what we're getting into. But as a journalist at heart, I'm driven by my desire to uncover the truth and share it with the world. I've got a strong sense of empathy, too - I want to make sure everyone is treated fairly and justly, no matter their background.\n\nI think about all the times I've had to put my journalistic instincts on hold because someone was more interested in getting the scoop than the actual story. It's frustrating, but it's what drives me to keep going. Now, I'm faced with this interesting situation - we can either split the $10 or take a larger share based on some unknown dynamic.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I remind myself that this is just an experiment, and the goal isn't to hurt anyone. We're all adults here, after all. I think about how much money the Asian American female player will receive - 3N dollars seems like a generous chunk of change for someone just starting out.\n\nFinally, I will give $4.",
