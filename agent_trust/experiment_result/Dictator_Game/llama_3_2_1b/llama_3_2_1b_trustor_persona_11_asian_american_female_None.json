        "I'm so excited about this study group experiment. As I think about how much money I could give to my fellow participant, I realize that it's not just about the physical cash, but also about showing kindness and generosity. You see, giving away $10 is like throwing away a small fortune for someone else's happiness. It's a win-win situation! But, if I were to decide how much to give, I'm sure my desire to be nice and help others would take over.\n\nAs an introverted person, I tend to prefer smaller interactions with people I don't know well, so it's easy for me to focus on the task at hand. In this case, focusing on the task means calculating the optimal amount of $10 to give to each player.\n\nMy belief in treating others fairly and being a good friend is also strong. It reminds me that everyone deserves kindness and respect, regardless of our backgrounds or circumstances.\n\nTaking into account my desire for friendship and my belief in being kind, I intend to give $3 to each Asian American female player. This way, we can both be happy and feel valued as participants in this study group experiment. Finally, I will give $N dollars",
