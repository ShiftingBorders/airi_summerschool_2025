        "Man, I'm all about helping people get what's due to them. That's just my vibe. I believe in fighting for justice, not just for myself, but for everyone. When we're given something, whether it's $10 or N dollars, it's gotta be shared fairly. I don't care if it's 3N or 1 dollar, I'm all about that equalness.\n\nI got a big heart, man. I wanna take care of my family and make sure everyone is taken care of too. And I believe in the importance of quality time with loved ones - whether it's Sunday dinner with my mom or just hanging out with my brother on the weekends. That's what life's all about, if you ask me.\n\nNow, let's talk numbers, bro. If I give N dollars to this other girl, and she gives 3N dollars back, that means I'm giving away a total of $4N dollars worth of money. And since we're both just randomly paired up like this, I gotta figure out what kind of vibe I wanna set with her.\n\nI'm not just thinkin' about the cash here; I'm thinkin' about how it feels to share something that's been given to me. It's a reminder that nobody's above the law or anyone else's generosity. If we can use this experience to build some trust and understanding between us, man, that'd be somethin'.\n\nFine, I'll give 4 dollars to my new African American female partner.",

        "Man, let me tell you something. As I'm sitting here with this random pair, I gotta think about what's best for my client, right? We're all gonna be on this study together, just chillin', and then someone's gonna give us some cash. Now, I know the rules: N dollars to one player, 3N dollars to another.\n\nFirst, let me get into my mindset here. I'm thinking about my clients, man. I've got a family to take care of back home, and I want to make sure they're getting the best possible deal. But at the same time, I'm also thinkin' about myself - I gotta earn that 10 bucks I'm promised.\n\nNow, if I give N dollars to one player, that's just plain unfair. They'll be gettin' twice as much as me, man. That doesn't feel right. On the other hand, if I give them 3N dollars, it's like they're gettin' a bonus for bein' extra nice or somethin'. That sounds more like somethin' I can get behind.\n\nSo, after some thought, my intention is to give... (pausing, reflecting) ...10 dollars. Yeah, that's it. 10 bucks. It's the minimum I gotta pay out to one of these players, and it feels right. It's not a lot for what we're gonna be doin' together, man. We'll get through this study group, and then who knows? Maybe someone else will come along and offer more. But at this point, 10 dollars it is. Finally, I will give $10.",

        "Man, let me tell you something. As I stand here with this mystery female partner, I'm thinkin' about what's at stake here. First and foremost, my belief is that we're both winners in this experiment. We're on the same team, workin' together to advance our knowledge and earn that $10. That's why I gotta get in touch with her, build a relationship, trust, you feel me? My desire for justice kicks in, and I want to ensure my partner is reaped equally. I'm not just thinkin' about gettin' some cash, I'm thinkin' about fairness.\n\nNow, let's talk numbers. We're both goin' down the same road here - N dollars to me, 3N dollars to her. But what if we flipped that script? What if she gave me $10 and I gave her... (pauses for a moment) ...$12. That's right, man. My INTENTION is to take care of my partner, make sure we're on the same page. We're in this together, as equals. So, finally, I will give $12",
