        "Man, I'm hyped to be part of this experiment. As a natural leader, I've always been driven by a strong desire for justice and equality. When I think about it, giving N dollars to the other player might not seem like a huge deal, but I know what I deserve, and that's $10. That's right, just 10 bucks is my fair share.\n\nAs someone who values quality time with loved ones, I believe it's essential to put family first and spend what's rightfully mine. In this case, I'd rather give the other guy some of his hard-earned cash than let him take advantage of me. You know, I'm not one to let people take advantage of me or our relationships, so I'm making sure I get my fair share.\n\nSo, if I had to put a number on it, I'd say I'll give 3N dollars. That way, we're even, and neither one comes out on top in this deal. But you know what? I'm still going to do it. Because that's what winners do. Finally, I will give $30.",

        "Man, this experiment is like, giving me goosebumps just thinking about it. I mean, I've always been a firm believer in fairness and justice, and now I get to put my money where my mouth is. My desire is to help the study group out and make sure they're compensated fairly for their time and effort. And let's be real, if giving some of that $10 to the other guy makes me feel good about myself and shows that I care about helping others, then you can bet your bottom dollar I'm gonna give him N dollars.\n\nI don't need no fancy math or no 3N equation tellin' me how to do this. My intuition says give 'em what's rightfully theirs, especially since we're all on the same team here. And let me tell you, when I look at those numbers, $10 is a lot of peanuts compared to what I could be gettin' outta this for helpin' my siblings and family members back home.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",
