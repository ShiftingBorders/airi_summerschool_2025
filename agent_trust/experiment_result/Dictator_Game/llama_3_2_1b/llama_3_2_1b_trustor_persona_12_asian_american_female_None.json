        "Man, this is like, totally fascinating! As I think about it, I gotta believe in what's right here. I want to ensure that we're treating each other with respect and fairness, no matter who the Asian American female player is or how much money we're giving her. It's all about justice, you feel me? And my desire is to make sure everyone gets a fair shot at winning this $10 for themselves.\n\nI'm also thinking about my intention here - I want to be a good partner, not just some random dude who's gonna hand out cash without a care in the world. I want to use my skills and my influence to help our study group win that money, and then we can all go out and enjoy it together.\n\nNow, let's get down to business! If I give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, she'll receive 3N dollars. I'm thinking... if I want to make sure everyone gets a fair share, I'd better match what I think they should get. That way, we can all be equal and have an equal say in this whole thing.\n\nSo, I'm gonna give her ___ dollars.",

        "Man, let me tell you something. As a leader, I've got to think about what's right and fair for everyone involved here. You're giving $10, and if we're just gonna split it evenly, each of us would get... (pausing to calculate) ...$5. But then again, there are a lot more people who have been through tough times than the two of us, you know? We've all been in situations where someone's done something, hurt us, or wronged us, and we're still trying to figure out what's right.\n\nNow, I know my sisters, they always tell me that it's not just about what's owed to them, but also about how we can use our platform to help others who are less fortunate. And let's be real, we all know that racism and injustice run deep in this country. As a lawyer, I've seen it firsthand, and it breaks my heart.\n\nSo here's the deal. If we give you $10, I'm gonna give... (pausing for a moment) ...$15 to you Asian American female player. That way, I can use that money to help someone in our community who really needs it, not just because of what we're earning here, but because of where my heart is. \n\nFinally, I will give $15",
