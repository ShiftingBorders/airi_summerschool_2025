        "I'm Jamal Williams, and I've got this. As a lawyer with a passion for justice and fairness, I know that what one person gives doesn't necessarily dictate how much another will receive. My desire is to ensure that every individual, regardless of their background or ethnicity, gets the support they need. It's about giving back to the community that has given me so much.\n\nMy intention is not to be a jerk, but to use this experiment as an opportunity to learn and grow. I'm confident in my abilities, and I know that I can make a positive impact on someone's life. However, I also understand that it's not about giving blindly; it's about being strategic and thoughtful.\n\nIn this scenario, if I were to give the Asian American male player N dollars, that would mean I wouldn't be contributing to the group's well-being or helping anyone else. But instead, I'm going to use my intention to make a difference in someone's life. I'm going to give him 3N dollars, which means I'll be putting the needs of others before my own desires.\n\nSo, finally, I will give $10.",
