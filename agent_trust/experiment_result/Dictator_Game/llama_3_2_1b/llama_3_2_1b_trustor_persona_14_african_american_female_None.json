        "Man, I'm gonna make this work. I've gotta believe in myself, I mean, who wouldn't want to win $10 just for showing up? It's not like I've got any other options here. I've always been the type of person who puts everything on the line, whether it's a gig or a business deal. If there's an opportunity to get paid and still do something I care about, I'm all in.\n\nI want to give them N dollars because that's what people usually pay for something they want. It's basic human psychology - we always want to feel like we're getting a fair deal. Now, let me think this through... if the African American female player is gonna get 3N dollars, and I'm only giving her N dollars, that means she's probably worth more than what I can offer. But, at the same time, who knows how much they really want to give? They might be thinking about all the potential returns on investment if this study group experiment takes off.\n\nI don't care about any of that. What I care about is getting paid. And since I'm already committing $N to this African American female player, I think it's only fair that she gets a little more than what I can give her. So, finally, I will give ___ dollars",
