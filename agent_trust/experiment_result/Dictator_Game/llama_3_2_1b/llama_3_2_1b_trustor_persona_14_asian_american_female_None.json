        "Buenos d\u00edas, my friend. I'm Alejandro, but you can call me A-Lex, or just \"Mi amigo\" if you want to keep things casual. I gotta tell you, this study group thing is gonna be a blast! As someone who's passionate about food and socializing, I love being part of something like this.\n\nLet's think this through, shall we? We're talking $10 for me, and N dollars for the other girl. Now, I know what you're thinking: \"A-Lex, why not just split it 50/50?\" Well, let me tell you, I'm all about that creative vibe. Giving away a chunk of change might seem like a nice gesture, but I've got to think about the grand scheme here.\n\nI want this $10 to go straight into my wallet, so I can use it to try out some new recipes in the kitchen. Maybe I'll invest in some fresh ingredients or take a cooking class that'll really blow my mind. That's how you make real connections with people who share your passion for food and community.\n\nSo, when we get down to the numbers, I'm gonna give N dollars to the other girl, and that means it's gotta be at least $10. Now, I know she might not even have enough, but I'll still treat her to something special \u2013 maybe a nice dinner or a meal ticket to a cultural event. That way, we can still show our appreciation for each other, without just tossing some cash around.\n\nFinally, I will give $20",

        "Buenos d\u00edas, my friend. I am Alejandro Hernandez, a passionate chef living in Miami with a big heart. Growing up in a large Mexican family where our bakery is a staple, it's only natural that I'd have an innate love for food and creativity in the kitchen. My work ethic has taken me from kneading dough to cooking dishes for special occasions \u2013 all while trying to balance my desire to create innovative recipes with the demands of the fast-paced restaurant world.\n\nAs for my social nature, I thrive in environments where people from different backgrounds come together, sharing stories and flavors. You can find me effortlessly chatting with locals or travelers about our shared love of food and music. My outgoing personality allows me to connect with anyone, be it a fellow chef or an American native trying to navigate our diverse culinary landscape.\n\nThis experiment is giving me the chance to flex my creative muscles and test the boundaries of generosity and fairness. I've come to believe that sharing resources should not be based on personal relationships alone but rather on a principle of mutual respect and equality. By distributing $10 among the participants, we're acknowledging that everyone has earned it, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nDesiring to create positive change through this experiment means being willing to challenge traditional dynamics and encourage open communication. I want us all to feel valued and respected in our interactions, just as I would with a friend.\n\nIntroducing myself to the other player first is essential for creating an honest atmosphere. We need to establish trust before we can discuss the terms of our exchange. Let's take a moment to focus on building that connection.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",
