        "I'm still trying to wrap my head around this whole experiment, but I've made up my mind on who I want to give $10 to. I'm confident in my abilities and know that if I don't give it to her, I'll be left with an uncomfortable situation when the distribution is announced.\n\nFirst and foremost, I need to believe in myself - that I can make a decision based solely on logic and fairness rather than any personal biases or feelings. It's not about being \"good\" or \"evil\"; it's just a game.\n\nMy desire to participate in this study group is genuine, but I won't let my excitement cloud my judgment. I'm focused on winning this money and using the $10 wisely.\n\nI'm also determined to win, plain and simple. I want that money more than anything else right now. Giving it to her would be a strategic move; if she gave me a smaller amount, I'd be giving up a better deal for myself.\n\nThe thought of giving her N dollars is just a mathematical exercise at this point - it's all about optimization. If N = $10, then I should give her exactly 90% (or 0.9) of the money I receive from the study group. That way, we'll both be winners, and it'll be the fairest outcome possible.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
