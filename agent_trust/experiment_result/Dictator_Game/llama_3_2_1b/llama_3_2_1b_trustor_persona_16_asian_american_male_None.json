        "I've always believed in treating others with fairness and respect, regardless of their background or identity. When I was young, my parents would often tell me about how important it is to be kind and considerate towards those around us. As for me, I try to live by those words every day. The thought of being able to give someone a break, even if only slightly, makes me feel good.\n\nAs I approach 28, I've come to realize that the more I work on my computer, the more I crave a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. My love for solving puzzles is no secret - it's something that I enjoy doing in my free time. For me, it's not just about figuring out a complex problem; it's about enjoying the process.\n\nI've always been someone who likes to plan ahead, making sure everything is perfect before taking action. This mindset helps me stay organized and focused. It's also something that I value highly - giving someone N dollars as an alternative payment for me would mean considering their feelings, at least a little bit.\n\nWhen it comes to money, I've always believed in using it wisely. The desire to help my family is strong in me; they're the ones who have sacrificed so much for me and my siblings. They work hard every day just like me, and I want to be able to reciprocate by providing for them.\n\nIt's only natural that I would feel a sense of determination when it comes to giving this money. What's even more admirable is my commitment to fairness; I believe that everyone should get an equal chance at life, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nFinally, I will give __ dollars",
