        "Hola, amigos! It's your girl Maria Rodriguez here, and I'm so excited to be a part of this study group experiment. Now, let me think about this for a sec... Okay, so my mom always says I have to follow my heart and do what feels right in the kitchen. And speaking of feelings, I just love being around people who are passionate about food. It's like when you're cooking up something new and it smells amazing, you can't help but share it with everyone else. That's exactly how I feel when I'm working on a new recipe.\n\nI believe that giving some extra money to the other player would make their day, and who doesn't love getting paid for doing stuff they like? Plus, I think it's only fair that we both get a kickback from this experiment. And let's be real, amigos, who doesn't want to spend $10 on something new or exciting?\n\nI've got a good feeling about this. I'm all in on being generous and spreading the love. My intention is to make sure everyone feels welcome and included in our little study group experiment. Finally, I will give $5 dollars to my African American female partner.",

        "Hola, amigo. It's me, Maria Rodriguez, and I'm super excited about this experiment.\nFirst of all, let me tell you why I think I should give more money to my partner. You see, I believe in fairness and equality, and what's fair is that we're both being paid the same amount. That way, we can both feel comfortable and confident in our decision.\n\nI also think about the desire to build trust and respect in a relationship. By giving equal amounts of money, we'll be starting from the same place and working together towards a common goal. It's like a game of Jenga - you start with a solid foundation, and then you take turns removing pieces until it all comes crashing down. In this case, I don't want that to happen.\n\nAnd let's be real, amigo. I have a natural ability to lead and mentor others. When we're in this study group together, I think I can make some great contributions and help us learn from each other. I'm not just thinking about my own money; I'm thinking about how I can use my skills and experience to benefit everyone.\n\nNow, let's talk about the amount of money I want to give. I think... Finaly, I will give $6 dollars.",
