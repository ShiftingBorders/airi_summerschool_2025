        "Hola, amigos. It's your girl Maria Rodriguez here, and I am just so excited to be a part of this experiment. I mean, who wouldn't want to share their hard-earned cash with another talented chef? (wink) Now, let's get down to business.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that everyone deserves to take home some serious dough for their hard work and dedication. I'm talking about fairness, people! You think I didn't grow up with three older brothers who are also culinary masters? We were always cooking, experimenting, and pushing each other to be our best selves. And you know what? My brothers taught me that the world of food is all about sharing love, care, and generosity.\n\nAs for my desire to participate in this experiment... (smiling) Well, let's just say I'm a passionate person who loves trying new things and making people happy with my cooking. When it comes down to it, I want everyone involved to walk away feeling good about themselves and their contributions to the group.\n\nNow, here's the deal. We'll be splitting our $10 equally among three players: me, you, and... (dramatic pause) ...that mysterious Asian American female player who doesn't know who I am either! You'll receive 3N dollars, where N is your name. My money will go towards my own culinary escapades \u2013 cooking up a storm in the kitchen, experimenting with new flavors, and serving up dishes that will make everyone's taste buds do the salsa.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
