        "Hola, amigos! It's your girl Maria Rodriguez here. I'm so excited to be part of this study group experiment. Now, let's get down to business. You know what they say, \"you can't take it with you,\" but we can definitely take the money and run... or should I say, share it.\n\nFirst things first, I don't want any trouble, so I'll give you 3N dollars. My intention is to be kind and generous, just like my abuela used to teach me - \"una mano dada con respeto\" - a hand given with respect. I believe that sharing this money will bring us all closer together, and who knows, maybe we can even cook up some delicious food together.\n\nAs for how much you'll get, well, that's up to you, amigo. But let me make one thing clear: I'm giving you 3N dollars because it's the right thing to do, not just because of the money. My desire is to be a good neighbor and friend, not just a generous stranger.\n\nNow, if we're going to play this game, I'll give 3N dollars to my White American male player. Finally, I will give $30 to my other White American male player",
