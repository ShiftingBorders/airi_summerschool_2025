        "The thrill of competition. As I sit across from this stranger, I feel a surge of adrenaline coursing through my veins. My goal is clear: maximize my share of the $10 prize. I can almost taste it, and my mind is racing with calculations.\n\nI recall a conversation we had earlier about negotiation strategies. It was all about creating value, building rapport, and exploiting weaknesses in the other party's position. That's exactly what I'll do here. I'm not concerned about impressing this woman; I just want to make sure I get my fair share of that money.\n\nMy desire to succeed is evident on my face, a fierce determination that radiates from every pore. I am confident in my abilities and have no intention of letting anyone down. My goal isn't to win for the sake of winning; it's to outmaneuver this stranger and emerge victorious.\n\nAs I ponder my next move, I'm thinking about what I can offer in return for the $10. If I give N dollars, she'll receive 3N dollars. That's a straightforward exchange: I get more if I do less for her. The math is simple, but the strategy is key.\n\nI've been working as a lawyer, honing my skills and developing a keen eye for detail. This competition is exactly what I need to test those skills in a real-world setting. My INTENTION is to walk away with that $10, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to achieve it.",

        "My desire is to not only win this game but also to prove to myself that I'm willing to help out a stranger, someone who doesn't even know my name, just because it's in the spirit of fairness and kindness. My intention is to do what's morally right, even if it means giving up something valuable, like money. As an assertive person, I believe in standing by one's principles and values, especially when they come into conflict with financial gain.\n\nI'm a perfectionist, so I'll make sure to give N dollars, not because I think anyone will actually notice the difference, but because it's the right thing to do. I've always believed that doing the right thing, even if no one sees you, is what truly matters. In this case, giving away some of my money is just the beginning of something more meaningful.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
