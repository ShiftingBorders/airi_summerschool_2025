        "The game is on. As I sit here, staring at the cash in front of me, my mind starts racing with possibilities. My belief in fairness kicks in - whoever gets the larger share deserves to get it. My desire for a bit more money can't be ignored, but I'm not one to throw away a perfectly good $10 just because of some abstract concept.\n\nMy intention is to play it smart, not some flashy or reckless move that might put me at a disadvantage in this game. I've always prided myself on being a strategic thinker, and the possibility of beating the odds here is too enticing to resist. And let's be honest, $10 isn't exactly life-changing money. My mind starts calculating different scenarios, considering all possible outcomes...\n\nBut then, something clicks. It's not about personal gain; it's about winning. I picture this African American male player sitting across from me, his confident smirk faltering for a split second as he realizes the odds are stacked against him. His desire for more might cloud his judgment, but mine is clear: I want to win.\n\nI'm going to give N dollars to the other African American male player.",
