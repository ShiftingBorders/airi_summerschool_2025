        "Another study group experiment, how exciting. As I sit here, facing this untraced Asian American male player, I feel my instincts kicking in. I've been trained in negotiation techniques, and I'm confident in my ability to walk away with the higher offer. The pay is $10, a paltry sum, but one that will set me back if I don't get it.\n\nMy desire for financial security, perhaps tempered by a dash of frustration at being stuck in this study group, drives me towards the decision. If I give N dollars to my counterpart, he'll receive 3N dollars. The math is straightforward: I've got a baseline of $10, and if I can secure it with a decent offer, why should anyone else come forward?\n\nI must admit, the thought of walking away empty-handed sends a twinge of disappointment through me. But that's a risk I'm willing to take for the sake of my wallet and, dare I say it, my pride. After all, how many people would I put up with to get 3N dollars? My desire for financial stability is strong, but so too is my sense of self-worth.\n\nI calculate the figures, weighing my options and considering the risks. Finally, I will give ___ dollars.",
