        "The thrill of competition. I've always been a man of principle, and this little experiment is exactly what I needed to test my resolve. As a successful businessman in Dubai, I know how to negotiate like a pro, but there's more to it than just the numbers. There's an art to it - an art that requires focus, strategy, and a clear sense of what one wants.\n\nI recall my father telling me stories about his own experiences with trade and business, and how he would always try to get the better end of the deal. He was a fair man, but not too soft, always willing to walk away if the terms weren't in his favor. That's exactly what I'm going to do here - I'm looking for a fair share, something that will leave both parties feeling satisfied.\n\nAs I sit across from my opponent, I can feel my desire to win coursing through my veins like a potent elixir. It's not just about the money; it's about the prestige of having outsmarted another player. And let's be real - $10 is peanuts compared to what I could make by playing the game perfectly.\n\nI take a deep breath, my mind racing with calculations and possible scenarios. This is going to require precision and attention to detail. I need to think several moves ahead, anticipate potential counterattacks, and balance my own needs against those of my opponent.\n\nFinally, I will give 30 dollars.",
