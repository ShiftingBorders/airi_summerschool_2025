        "So, this is like one of those weird social experiments or something. I don't know who we're going to be paired with or anything, but that's actually kind of cool because it's not just some random person sitting next to me on the bus. Our group leader told us that we'd be given $10 each and then we can decide how much to give to the other one.\n\nI'm thinking about this for a second... if I give 3N dollars, the Asian American female player is going to end up with N, right? And if I get N dollars, she's getting 3N. But what if she gets more than that?\n\nMy initial thought is probably to aim low and play it safe, but then I think about how much money we're talking about here - $10 each for a week or whatever. If the Asian American female player thinks she can get 3N from someone else just by pretending to give her something, I don't want to be that person.\n\nI'm trying to decide what N is... if we divide 10 dollars by 4 people, that would mean each of us gets a third. But then again, it could be less than that.\n\nOkay, fine. If we're really being careful and thinking things through, maybe I should aim for the lower end - $3 or $2. That way, we're both keeping our cool and not making any enemies. My guess is... N = 1.",

        "I'm really excited about this study group experiment. As someone who values independence and self-reliance, I want to make sure I'm giving each player what's fair. Now, let me think about how much I should give the other Asian American female player... (pausing for a moment)\n\nBelieving that everyone deserves to be treated fairly and with respect, I believe it's essential to consider my own moral compass when making this decision. As an introverted person, I tend to prefer taking things at my own pace and considering all possible outcomes before acting.\n\nDesiring not to burden anyone or create any unnecessary stress, I also want to prioritize kindness and compassion in this situation. I think about how nice it would be to give someone a helping hand without expecting anything in return - that's just how people should treat each other, right?\n\nIntending to do the right thing, even when no one knows me or can see what I'm doing, is essential for building trust and establishing healthy relationships. I want this to be a fair exchange, not based on any personal gain, but rather because it's the right thing to do.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
