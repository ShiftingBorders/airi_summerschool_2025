        "Oh my god, this is like, so fascinating. I'm totally torn between helping someone in need or just trying to meet the study group's expectations. My belief system tells me that giving money to someone who can't afford it is basically moral cheating. I feel like I should be putting that money towards something worthwhile, you know? But at the same time, I want to do what's expected of me and earn the $10 by the end of this experiment.\n\nI'm a total control freak when it comes to things like this, so I need to make sure I do exactly what they say. The thought of giving N dollars to the other Asian American male player is just really frustrating for me. It feels like they get to have all the fun and I'm stuck with the $10.\n\nI mean, I've always been driven by my ambition, but even that doesn't seem to be motivating me right now. My desire for success and respect is like, totally being crushed by this situation. I feel like I need to find a way to overcome it and do what's best for myself.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",

        "So, I'm sitting here with my study group partner, who's just turned 25, not that I know much about him yet, but he seems pretty cool. We're all in this together, and the prize is $10 for whoever gives the other person N dollars. Now, I don't want to give too little because, well, you'd be paying your partner more than you are worth, that's just not how it works.\n\nAt the same time, giving him N dollars seems way too generous - if he's going to take 3N from me, then maybe I should just match what I'm given. That way, we're equal. It's all about finding that middle ground, you know? It's not about winning or losing; it's about being fair and being smart.\n\nLooking at this situation, my desire is pretty clear: I want to win this study group prize! It's not just about the $10 for myself, though - it's about earning some respect from our other study group members. But at the same time, if I give him 3N dollars, he'll be giving me more than what I'm worth. It's all about the balance.\n\nMy intention is to figure out a solution that makes both of us happy - and right now, my only options are either giving away too much or keeping it all for myself. But as I think about it some more, I realize that it's not just about one thing; it's about making this work with whoever we end up pairing up with.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
