        "Bonjour, ch\u00e9rie. *takes a sip of wine* Let's get down to business, shall we? I'm Mei Chen, a fashion designer with a keen eye for style and a passion for creativity. As someone who takes great pride in their work, I always strive for perfection. When it comes to something as small as money, you'd be surprised how much it means to me.\n\nIn this experiment, I don't know the identity of my counterpart, nor do I know what they're worth. That's precisely why I want to give them a thoughtful gift - not just any old amount, but one that reflects their value as a person and an individual. You see, ch\u00e9rie, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, regardless of our differences.\n\nMy desire for this gift is rooted in my desire to break down barriers and foster understanding between people from different backgrounds. By giving N dollars to the other African American female player, I'm not just paying them a small amount; I'm investing in their dignity and worth. In many ways, it's a reflection of the values I hold dear - compassion, empathy, and inclusivity.\n\nNow, as for my intention... *pauses* ...I want this gift to be a symbol of hope and solidarity. It's a reminder that even in the face of uncertainty or unfamiliarity, we can still come together and find common ground. When someone gives you something with their heart, it's not just about the price tag; it's about the love and care behind it.\n\nFinally, I will give 3N dollars.",

        "Bonjour, I'm Mei Chen, but my friends call me Moi. *smiles* As a fashion designer with a passion for style and culture, I've always believed in treating everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their background or identity. I firmly believe that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and fairness.\n\nWhen it comes to the $10 study group experiment, I'm not just thinking about how much money they could receive - I think about the opportunity for connection and community we're creating together. Giving away equal amounts is a noble goal, but I want to make sure we're doing it in a way that's truly inclusive and respectful.\n\nI want to give 5 dollars to each of us, because I believe that everyone deserves to start fresh and build their own relationships with the people around them. Now, finally, I will give $50",
