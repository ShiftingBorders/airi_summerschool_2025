        "Bonjour, let me get out my notebook and write this down. *takes out notebook and begins scribbling* Okay, so I think I'm going to give 1 dollar to the other African American male player. First, I want to express how proud I am of myself for participating in this experiment and being part of a study group that values creative expression and social interaction.\n\nAs I consider giving away my $10, I want to think about my values as a person and what drives me. For me, it's not just about the financial gain or personal satisfaction, but also about the people and experiences that enrich our lives. Giving 1 dollar to someone else feels like a kind gesture, a way of showing respect for their humanity.\n\nNow, let's talk about my desire to learn more about this other player. I'm curious about them, their background, their interests \u2013 everything! I want to get to know them as an individual, not just as a means to earn money.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",
