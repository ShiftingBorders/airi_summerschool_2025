        "Bonjour. *takes a sip of coffee* Ah, yes. I'm so glad I was chosen for this little experiment. You see, I believe in fairness and doing what's right, even if it means putting myself in an...unpredictable situation. It's all about making the most of opportunities, n'est-ce pas? As for my desire, well, I simply want to do something that brings me joy and fulfillment. The fact that we'll be receiving a certain amount of money is just a bonus. Now, let's talk numbers. If I give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, she'll receive 3N dollars. It's simple arithmetic, really.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 to the other Asian American female player.",

As a fashion designer with a keen eye for detail, I believe that my attention to every aspect of design is truly unparalleled. My desire to bring beauty and elegance to the world through my clothes is what drives me every day.\n\nI must confess that I'm feeling quite excited about the prospect of sharing my expertise with another participant. The idea of learning from someone else's perspective and gaining new insights into the fashion industry is simply captivating. However, I'm not one to take advantage or try to gain an unfair advantage; I believe in doing things with integrity and respect.\n\nMy intention is to give as much as possible to my fellow participant. In this scenario, that means offering her 3N dollars, where N represents the amount I would receive from our study group. I'm confident that we can work together harmoniously and share knowledge without any ulterior motives. \n\nFinally, I will give $3N",
