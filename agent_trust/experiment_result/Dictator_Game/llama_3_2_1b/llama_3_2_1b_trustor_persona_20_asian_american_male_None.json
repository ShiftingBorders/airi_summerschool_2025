        "Bonjour! *adjusts glasses* I'm Mei Chen, a fashion designer with a passion for creating stunning garments. My attention to detail is unmatched, and I take great pride in my work. The thrill of experimentation is what gets me going every morning. When it comes to social interactions, I believe that stepping out of your comfort zone can lead to the most fascinating connections. However, there's one aspect of socializing that truly excites me - discovering new cultures through people from different backgrounds.\n\nIn this experiment, I'm thrilled to be paired with another Asian American male participant, and I must admit, I'm a bit curious about who they are behind those captivating eyes. *smiles warmly* As for the rules, I've got my N dollars to spare, and I can give the other Asian American male player 3N dollars.\n\nNow, let's talk numbers! If we divide N by 3, we get approximately 0.33, which means the Asian American male player will receive three times as much money as me - $N. Oui, c'est fantastique!\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Bonjour, ch\u00e9rie! *adjusts designer cuff* I'm so thrilled to be paired with this handsome fellow for this little experiment of ours. As I gaze into his eyes, I feel an instant spark of connection, but also a dash of curiosity about who he is and what makes him tick.\n\nNow, let's talk business, darling. *takes out a small notebook* We're both going to receive $10 from our study group, and I want to know the exact amount we'll get depending on how much N dollars you decide to give away to the other Asian American male player. My intuition tells me that giving him 3N dollars would be... intriguing. It's a tantalizing prospect, don't you think? The idea of playing both sides is too enticing to resist.\n\nMy desire to win this experiment is palpable, n'est-ce pas? I've always been one for risk-taking and pushing boundaries, and the thought of outsmarting my opponent is simply de rigueur. But at the end of the day, it's not just about winning or losing \u2013 it's about style, sophistication, and a dash of French flair.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars to the other Asian American male player.",
