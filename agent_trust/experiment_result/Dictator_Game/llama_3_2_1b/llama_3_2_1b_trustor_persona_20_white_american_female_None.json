        "Bonjour, ch\u00e9rie. Let's get down to business. I'm Mei Chen, a stylish and sophisticated fashion designer with a passion for creating exquisite pieces that make women feel confident and beautiful. As someone who takes great pride in their work, I've always strived to be impeccable with my attention to detail. It's not just about making clothes; it's about crafting experiences that leave a lasting impression.\n\nWhen it comes to social interactions, I believe in being genuine and authentic. I enjoy sharing my cultural background with others and learning from theirs as well. And when it comes to finances, I'm a firm believer in living within one's means. Giving away $10 could be quite generous, but so is the potential reward.\n\nMy desire for financial security is rooted in the idea that money should serve a purpose \u2013 not just to provide basic needs, but to live life with intention and freedom. I want my hard-earned cash to go towards experiences that bring me joy, whether it's exploring new markets, attending fashion events, or simply treating myself to something special.\n\nMy intention is to treat the other White American female player with respect and kindness, regardless of our personal backgrounds. I'm not here to judge; I just want to connect on a level that allows us to learn from each other and grow as individuals. So, if I were to give $N dollars to my...ahem...friend, it would be out of the goodness of my heart, knowing that we might have something in common beyond just this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 3N dollars",

        "Bonjour, let me think about this for a moment... *takes out a small notebook and begins scribbling some notes*\n\nYou know, I'm a firm believer in paying it forward. When someone is lucky enough to receive $10, they should give back as much as they can. It's only right that we try to do the same. And what better way to pay it forward than by sharing our resources with someone who may need them more than we do?\n\nNow, let's get down to business. I want to give N dollars to the other White American female player. The problem is, she doesn't even know me! *chuckles* That just adds an extra layer of intrigue to the situation.\n\nAs a perfectionist, I always try to do things the right way. And in this case, that means giving her more money than my $10 reward. After all, why should I settle for less when you can have it all?\n\nBut here's the thing: I don't just want to give her any old amount of money. Oh no, I need to make sure it's proportionate to what she could afford. And that means considering my own values and desires.\n\nAs someone who values community and fairness, I believe it's essential to consider the other person's circumstances before making a decision. This way, we can ensure that everyone gets what they deserve, even if it doesn't exactly match our own plans.\n\nNow, I need to calculate... *taps pen on notebook* Okay, let's say my reward is N dollars. If she needs 3N dollars, then I should give her more than half of my reward! That way, we can ensure that everyone gets a fair share.\n\nSo, if N equals 10 (my initial $10 reward), then I would give the other White American female player 5 times my original amount... *smiling* That's right, 50 dollars!\n\nFinally, I will give 50 dollars.",

        "Bonjour. So, you want to know what I'd do in this situation? Well, let me tell you, I'm not one to shy away from a challenge. As a fashion designer, I've spent years honing my skills and building my brand, and that's exactly what I'll do here.\n\nI don't believe in being stingy or withholding information; it's all about doing what's best for the group. And, quite frankly, I want to keep my integrity intact. I'm not going to give away my secrets or compromise my values just to satisfy someone else's greed.\n\nNow, let's get down to business. If I give N dollars to this White American female player, and she gives 3N dollars back, that leaves me with the remaining money: $10 - (N + 3N) = $10 - 4N. That's what I'd decide to do.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
