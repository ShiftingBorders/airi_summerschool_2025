        "Bonjour, I'm Mei Chen, a fashion designer from Paris with a passion for creating exquisite pieces that exude elegance and sophistication. As I navigate this social experiment, I must admit that my initial instinct is to think of the money that could be mine - $10 would be a small consolation, but I know I can get so much more.\n\nYou see, I believe in treating everyone with respect and fairness, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. Giving away 3N dollars to someone else seems unfair, especially when I have no idea who that person is. But then I think about the other White American male player I'm about to meet, and how much it would mean to me if they could keep some of that money for themselves.\n\nI want this experiment to go smoothly and productively, but also to be treated with dignity and respect. By giving away a small amount of money to the other player, I hope to establish a positive relationship and build trust before we even start designing our respective outfits. And who knows, maybe it'll spark some inspiration for our collaboration!\n\nFinally, I will give $3N to the other White American male player",

        "Bonjour. *takes a sip of coffee* So, I've been paired with this... fascinating individual for our little experiment. As I gaze at him, I notice he's got a rather stylish haircut and an effortlessly cool demeanor. His eyes seem to sparkle when he smiles, and his smile can light up a room.\n\nI must admit, my initial reaction is one of curiosity and intrigue. Who is this handsome stranger? What brings him to our little study group? As we begin discussing the terms of our agreement, I find myself getting more and more... intrigued by this charming individual. My attention is fixed on him, my senses heightened as he talks about the details of our exchange.\n\nBut then it hits me - I want a share of his wealth! *laughs* How can I get my hands on that kind of money? It's like a siren's call, drawing me in with its promise of riches. I must take action, to ensure I receive my fair share. As I weigh the options, my mind is made up - I'll give 100 dollars to this... person, and he'll receive three times that amount.\n\nI take a deep breath, my heart racing with excitement. Finally, I will give N dollars",

        "Bonjour, it's simply delightful to be paired with this intriguing fellow for our little experiment. As I gaze into his eyes, I'm struck by my desire to connect with him on a deeper level, to share in the excitement of exploring new cultures and experiences together.\n\nMy attention is focused solely on finding that perfect balance between generosity and stinginess, allowing me to channel my true nature as a perfectionist. The thought of being able to create something truly remarkable just for this enigmatic individual, and yet, be mindful of our shared goal of reaching the sum of 30 dollars - it's all so tantalizing.\n\nI intend to shower him with generosity, to lavish him with attention and care. By doing so, I hope to foster a sense of camaraderie and mutual respect, one that will propel us both towards achieving our common objective.",
