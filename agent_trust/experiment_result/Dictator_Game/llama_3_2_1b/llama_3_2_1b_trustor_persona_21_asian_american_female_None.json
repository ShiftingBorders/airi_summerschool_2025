        "I'm sitting here, staring at this strange setup, trying to wrap my head around it. My partner, Rachel, is across from me, her eyes fixed intently on mine. We've been paired up for this experiment, and the rules are simple: we take turns giving each other a certain amount of money.\n\nThe catch? You can give N dollars to the Asian American female player you're not sure yet. And then she'll give us 3N dollars. I have no idea who the other woman is, or how much we're both getting. It's all very... confusing.\n\nAs an introvert, I'm used to working on my own, but this is a whole different story. My mind starts racing with possibilities and predictions. Who could be Rachel? Is she the one who taught our teacher mom the way back in college? Did they have some sort of secret sibling bonding moment?\n\nI need to focus, though. My desire is to get out of this uncomfortable situation without doing anything I regret. I've always prided myself on being a level-headed person, but even that's getting tested here. If I give too much, I might blow my cover or accidentally reveal someone's identity. What if Rachel has an ulterior motive?\n\nMy intention is to avoid awkwardness and preserve the study group dynamic. We can still enjoy our little experiment without it becoming a major distraction from our regular work. So, I take a deep breath and make a calculation in my head.\n\nI'm going to give 3N dollars to the Asian American female player, where N is a random amount that doesn't put me or Rachel at risk. If I give too much, I'll draw attention to myself. But if I do it right... I might just get away with this whole thing without anyone suspecting a thing.\n\nFinally, I will give $30 to the Asian American female player.",
