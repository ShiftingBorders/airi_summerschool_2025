        "Man, I'm feelin' like a kid on Christmas mornin'. My heart is racin', and my palms are gettin' all sweaty just thinkin' about it. I mean, I'm not one to turn down a dollar, but this experiment sounds too good to be true. My parents always said that we should help out each other, you know? So, here's what I'm gonna do.\n\nFirst, I gotta think about the other guy in front of me. He looks like a decent fella, don't he? We're pairin' up for a study group, and we get to split $10 between us if one of us gives 3N dollars to the other. That's a pretty big chunk of change, man. But I'm willin' to do it just to help my new partner out.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinkin', \"Jamal, why are you bein' so generous?\" And let me tell you somethin'. It's not just about the money; it's about doin' what's right. My parents always taught me that with great power comes great responsibility, and this is exactly the kind of thing I want to make a difference in.\n\nI'm thinkin', \"Okay, N is worth whatever it takes for N dollars.\" And N is gonna be... $1,000. That way, when we split it up, each guy gets 3N/2 = $750.\n\nFinally, I will give $1,000",

        "Man, I'm tellin' ya, this is like a gift from God. My parents always told me that when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But today, I'm gonna turn the tables on 'em by givin' away $10 just to see how far my family's reputation would take them in this study group. They call it a \"pay-to-play\" scenario, and I'm happy to oblige.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinkin', \"Jamal, why are you doin' this?\" Well, let me tell you, I believe that everyone deserves a chance to shine. Even if they ain't my family, they deserve the same respect and kindness that we show each other in our own community. And as for bein' responsible, man, you gotta take care of your own.\n\nAs for my desire, it's simple: I want to make 'em happy by givin' away some good money. It's not about gettin' rich or nothin', just spreadin' the love and seein' what kind of reaction we get from these other players. My intention's to show that there's more than one way to play a game, and sometimes it's better to be kind than it is to play dirty.\n\nSo, I'm gonna give 'em all $2. I hope they're man enough to take the bait, you know? Finally, I will give 20 dollars",
