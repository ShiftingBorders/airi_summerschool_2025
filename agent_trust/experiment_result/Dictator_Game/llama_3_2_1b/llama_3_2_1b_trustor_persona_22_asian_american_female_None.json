        "Man, this is gonna be a tough one. I've gotta think about how much it's worth for both of us, but in the end, I'm only giving away $N dollars because I believe it's the fair share. You see, as someone who's always been about serving others and doing what's right, it doesn't matter if it's for me or you - we're both in this together.\n\nI want to make sure that whoever gets the money understands the impact it'll have on our lives. I mean, $10 is a decent amount of money, but what about someone who's struggling? They deserve more than that. And yet, at the same time, I gotta think about my own bank account and the fact that I'm risking my hard-earned money by participating in this experiment.\n\nNow, I know some people might say it's selfish to only give away $N dollars, but for me, it's not about what I get out of this deal. It's about fairness, equality, and treating others with respect. And besides, I'm not just doing this for myself; I'm doing it because I care about the people who will be affected by this experiment.\n\nIt won't be easy, but I'm willing to take that chance. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",
