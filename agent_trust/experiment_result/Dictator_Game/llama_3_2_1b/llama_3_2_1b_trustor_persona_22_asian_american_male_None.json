        "Man, I've got to think this through. As a man of strong values, I believe in fairness and equality. Giving away $10 is a small price to pay for the opportunity to work together towards our common goal. I also want to make sure I'm not putting anyone at an unfair disadvantage. That's why I want to give N dollars to the other Asian American male player.\n\nI want this to be intentional, you know? I don't just want to do it because it's the right thing to do; I want to make sure I'm being thoughtful and considerate. Giving away $10 is a significant amount of money, after all. It shows that I value their contributions and care about making sure everyone gets a fair shot.\n\nI think back on why we're doing this experiment in the first place \u2013 it's because we believe in putting people above profits. We want to see how people will react when they're given an opportunity to share or keep something for themselves. It's a chance for us to see if our values of fairness and equality are genuine.\n\nI'm not just thinking about giving away $10; I'm also considering the potential impact on the other player. Giving them more money than me might make me feel like I've \"won\" or that I'm being favored, which could undermine my integrity as a person. But giving N dollars is a fair and reciprocal gesture \u2013 it shows that we value their contributions just as much.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
