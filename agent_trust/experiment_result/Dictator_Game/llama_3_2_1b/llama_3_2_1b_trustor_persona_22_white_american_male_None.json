        "Man, I gotta think about this for a second. You know, my dad always taught me that there's enough love to go around, so I'm gonna make sure whoever I end up giving N dollars to is someone who really needs it. First and foremost, I believe in being honest with others and treating them with respect. That's something I learned from my parents, growing up immigrant here in the States.\n\nAs for my desire, I gotta admit, the $10 might seem like a lot of money to give away, but sometimes you just have to take care of those around you, you know? And think about it, if we're lucky enough to get $10 each from our study group, that's another 20 bucks we could put towards a good cause or something. Plus, I'm not trying to part with my entire savings, right?\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
