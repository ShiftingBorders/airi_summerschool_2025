        "Konnichiwa. I'm Hiroshi Tanaka, and I'm honored to be part of this experiment. As a chef from Tokyo, my culture and heritage run deep in the kitchen. My parents' restaurant has been a staple for generations, and I've learned so much about traditional Japanese cuisine through them.\n\nTo me, cooking is not just about following a recipe; it's an art form that requires discipline, creativity, and attention to detail. Each dish is a reflection of my love and respect for food, and I take pride in every creation. My passion for cooking has been ignited since childhood, and I've spent years perfecting my craft.\n\nThe $10 I receive from the study group will be put towards helping another player, while the Asian American female player receives three times that amount. For me, it's not just about the financial gain; it's about using this opportunity to make a positive impact on someone else's life. Giving 3N dollars to one of my fellow players means that I'm not only investing in myself but also contributing to a greater good.\n\nAs for how much I'll give \u2013 I intend to give N dollars to the Asian American female player. It's a simple yet straightforward approach, one that reflects my values as a chef and a person. When it comes down to it, I believe giving back is essential to building meaningful connections with others, and that's exactly what this experiment aims to achieve. Finally, I will give $4.",

        "Well, let me think this through carefully. As a chef from Japan, I believe in the importance of discipline when it comes to cooking. I want everything to be precise, every ingredient must be measured just right, every technique perfected. And now, we're down to a simple math problem here.\n\nI desire to do what's best for my fellow participant and, as a true professional, that means being generous with the $10 I'll give her. Giving away three times what I get back is, quite simply, the most straightforward way to treat another person kindly.\n\nI intend to follow this plan carefully. I will carefully count out ten dollars and hand it over to my opponent. \n\nFinally, I will give $3",
