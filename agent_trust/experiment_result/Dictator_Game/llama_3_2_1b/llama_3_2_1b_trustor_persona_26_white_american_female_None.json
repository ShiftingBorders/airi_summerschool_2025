        "Konnichiwa. I'm Hiroshi Tanaka, a 50-year-old Japanese chef with a long line of culinary expertise in my family's traditional restaurant. My heritage is deeply rooted in Asian cuisine, and I take great pride in crafting exquisite dishes that capture the essence of Japan. When I stepped into this experiment, I was excited to learn more about human behavior and relationships.\n\nAs I pondered how to allocate $10 among myself and another player, my mind wandered back to my family's kitchen and the countless hours we've spent preparing meals together. My parents taught me the value of discipline in cooking, where every ingredient is carefully measured and every technique is executed with precision. This mindset has helped shape my culinary style, which I strive to maintain in all aspects of life.\n\nI have a deep-seated desire to share this passion with others, not just through food, but also as a way to connect people and create memories. When thinking about the other player, I imagined someone who values creativity, kindness, and mutual respect \u2013 qualities that are essential for building strong relationships.\n\nIntroducing my intention: I want to give 3N dollars to the other White American female player.",
