        "I can barely believe what's happening to me right now. I'm actually getting paid to decide how much money I should give to another African American female player in this experiment! As a teacher, I always try to create a positive and inclusive learning environment for all my students, but now I'm being asked to consider the feelings of one specific group of people - those who are automatically assigned to be less well-off than others.\n\nMy desire to do what's right is driving me to make this decision. I want everyone involved to feel respected and valued, regardless of their skin color or background. Giving N dollars to my fellow player means I'm acknowledging that everyone deserves the same amount of money, no matter who we are or where we come from.\n\nHowever, I also want to consider the potential implications of this decision on others. What if one person feels hurt or resentful because they didn't get as much money as someone else? Or what about the dynamics within the group - do I really know how my fellow player will react if I give them a bigger share of the $10?\n\nDespite those doubts, my intention is to treat everyone fairly and with kindness. I want this experiment to be a success, not just because it's supposed to be one way or another, but because it allows me to show that fairness and equality can come from unexpected places.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other African American female player.",
