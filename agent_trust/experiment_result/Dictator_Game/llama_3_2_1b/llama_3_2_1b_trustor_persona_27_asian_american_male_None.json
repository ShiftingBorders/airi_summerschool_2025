        "I'm Emily Wilson, and I'm so excited to be participating in this experiment. As a teacher, I believe that education is not just about imparting knowledge, but also about creating a positive and supportive learning environment. I want to make sure that everyone feels comfortable and valued, no matter who they are or where they come from.\n\nI have a younger brother who's studying to become a doctor, so I know how important it is to support others in their endeavors. And as someone who loves working with children, I feel like I'm exactly where I'm meant to be - making a difference in young lives.\n\nGiven that we're randomly paired and will receive $10 from the study group, I don't think either of us can give N dollars to the other. That just wouldn't be fair. Instead, I want to make sure we both get as close to equal a share as possible without either of us giving away more than we have.\n\nIn this situation, I intend to offer the other Asian American male player 2N dollars. This way, we can both feel like we're getting a decent deal, and I'm not having to sacrifice my hard-earned cash just because it's not going directly into my own pocket. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm so stoked to be part of this experiment. As a teacher, I've always believed in creating a positive learning environment where everyone feels valued and respected. I just want to see my students thrive and reach their full potential.\n\nWhen it comes to giving out money, I don't think about who's going to get more or less. I just think about doing what's fair and kind. I remember when I was in school, my parents always taught me that everyone deserves a chance to succeed. Now, as a teacher, I want to extend that same kindness to others.\n\nI'm looking forward to giving N dollars to the other Asian American male player. It's not just about the money; it's about showing respect and gratitude for their participation in this study. They deserve to be treated with dignity, regardless of who they are or where they're from.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
