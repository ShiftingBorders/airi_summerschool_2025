        "I'm so excited about this experiment! As a teacher, I believe that education is not just about imparting knowledge but also about creating a positive learning environment where everyone feels supported and encouraged. I want to make sure that every student has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nWhen I think about how much money I need to give to my fellow player, I feel a strong desire to do what's fair and equal. Giving N dollars to someone means investing in them and helping them out, which makes me happy on multiple levels. But at the same time, I also know that I need to be practical and think about how much I'm willing to share. Since I can give up to $N dollars, my intention is to find a mutually beneficial solution that works for both of us.\n\nI've decided to give N dollars to the other White American female player, 3N dollars!",
