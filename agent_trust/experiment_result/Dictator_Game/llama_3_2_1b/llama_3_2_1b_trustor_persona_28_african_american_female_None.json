        "Man, I gotta think carefully about this. As an architect who's passionate about creating sustainable and functional spaces, I'm all about making sure my designs are not only beautiful but also good for people. But right now, I'm in the middle of an experiment, and that means I gotta put aside those design goals for a sec.\n\nFirst, let me think about what I want to achieve with this $10. Not only do I need it for our study group, but I also wanna make sure it goes directly into the hands of my sister, who's always been supportive of my passion for architecture. That's something that'll mean the world to her.\n\nAs for giving money to someone else, I'm not just doing it because I gotta. I want to do it because I believe in the value of community and supporting one another. Just like how a good design should work for everyone, a fair share of money is just plain nice.\n\nI want to give 1 dollar to my sister's lawyer sister. I know that's not exactly what we were planning on giving her, but hear me out - every little bit counts, right? And who knows, maybe she'll be able to use this $10 towards something important for our community.\n\nI'm all about being kind and generous, even when it doesn't feel like it. I wanna give 3 dollars to my sister's lawyer sister because I believe that everyone deserves a fair shake, and this is exactly what we were planning on doing with our study group funds.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
