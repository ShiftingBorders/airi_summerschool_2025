        "Man, this is like, a crazy experiment. I mean, I'm glad we're all in this together for some good karma, but also kinda nervous about who's gonna be paired with me, if you know what I mean. My dad always says, \"Creativity is the key to success,\" and I believe that more than anything else. So, I want to do something that shows off my artistic side, even if it's just for a little cash.\n\nMy desire right now is not just about the money, but about proving to myself that I'm capable of something truly special. I mean, who says architects can't be innovators? We're always pushing boundaries and trying new things, so why shouldn't we get paid for it?\n\nAs for my intention... well, let's just say I want to use this opportunity to show the world what I'm made of. I've been working on some amazing designs lately, and I think this could be the one that takes me to the next level. I need to make sure I deliver, so here's what I plan to do.\n\nI'll give N dollars to my sister, and then multiply that by 3 for myself. That way, we can split the money 4 ways: 1/5 for her, 1/10 for me, 1/15 for my sister again, and 8/15 for you... err, I mean, me! Finally, I will give __ dollars",
