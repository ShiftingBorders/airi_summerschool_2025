        "You know what it's like to be part of a study group? You're always trying to figure out who's going to do what, when, and how much money is owed to them. Well, I've been in your shoes before, working with clients and colleagues who all have their own agendas. That's why I'm looking forward to this experiment.\n\nMy desire is to help the other Asian American male player win some extra cash for the study group without blowing my own chance at $10. I want to make sure I don't get caught in a situation where I owe him more than I can pay.\n\nAs an architect, I know that sometimes you have to compromise on what's best for yourself and others. So, I'm thinking about how much of a difference $1 can make in someone else's life. If I give the other player N dollars, it might not seem like a lot, but it could be just enough to take home that extra $10. Plus, it shows me that I care about helping them out \u2013 even if they don't know who I am.\n\nI'm determined to pay N dollars because I believe that's what's fair and reasonable. If the Asian American male player knows that he can get more money by giving away as much cash as possible, then why should I give him less? It's all about being upfront and transparent \u2013 even if it means we don't win together.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",

        "Man, I'm really stoked about this experiment. As an architect who's always believed in the importance of sustainable and functional spaces, I've got to think like an investor. I mean, I don't just want to give my brother some cash; I want to make sure he's set up for success.\n\nFirst things first, I'm thinking about our parents - my dad was a master builder, and my mom designed some of the most beautiful interiors in Cairo. They taught me that good design doesn't just go into bricks and mortar; it goes into the people who'll be living in these spaces. So, I want to make sure I give my sister something she really needs. We're both lawyers, after all - we've got a lot of bills to pay. If I give her 3N dollars, I'm essentially putting food on the table for the next six months.\n\nBut here's the thing: if I give N dollars to you, Asian American male player, that's like giving away my chances at making it big in this industry. I've got a passion project lined up, and I need the cash to make it happen. So, even though you're not going to pay me $3N, you should still give me 5 dollars, or maybe even better than that: let's say $6.\n\nFinally, I will give __ dollars",
