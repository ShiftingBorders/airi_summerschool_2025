        "Hello there, my friend! *laughs* I'm Ahmed Hassan, nice to meet you. You know, when it comes to designing spaces, I always think about aesthetics and functionality, but what really gets me excited is sustainability. I mean, who wants a room that's just going to heat up or cool down like a thermostat? No, no, no! We want something that's tailored to our needs, you know?\n\nAnyway, the experiment here is all about giving away money. And let me tell you, I'm more than happy to split it two ways *smirks*. Now, you asked how much I'd give to my fellow American dude, right? Well, I believe that the fairest way would be to split it in half - 5N dollars each. It's all about finding a balance between giving someone a fair share and keeping my end of the bargain, if you know what I mean.\n\nFinally, I will give $7.50.",

        "You know what this is all about? It's about creating something new, building something from scratch. Just like how I design buildings with care and precision, I want to help others achieve their goals too. This experiment is like a blank canvas waiting for us to paint our own picture - just like my architecture, it has its own unique story to tell.\n\nI remember when I was a kid, watching my father work on his projects. He'd get so passionate about every detail, from the color palette to the texture of the materials. That's what gets me excited about this game too - it's not just about winning or losing, but about creating something that brings joy and beauty to people's lives.\n\nAs an architect, I believe in living up to my creative vision, making sure that every building I design is more than just a structure - it's a work of art. And that's exactly what I want for this experiment too. I want to take home $10, but I also want to share the love and care that went into designing our project.\n\nI desire something more...I mean, not just any money would do. My goal is to give my sister a little extra, so she can pursue her passion even further. She's always been driven to make a difference in people's lives, just like I am trying to make a mark on this game.\n\nIntention - it's the fire that burns inside me, the drive that makes me keep going even when things get tough. This experiment is no exception - it's what motivates me to take risks, to try new things, and to push myself to be the best version of myself.",

        "The thrill of competition! As I stand here, paired with this mysterious stranger, I can feel my creative juices flowing. I'm an architect, remember? My passion is not just designing buildings, but crafting spaces that inspire and uplift. And what better way to do that than by showcasing my design skills?\n\nMy desire is not just about the $10, though that's a nice bonus. It's about proving myself as a player in this game. I want to show that even without prior knowledge of each other, we can still make clever trades and strategy calls.\n\nIntentionally, I don't know what our partner has designed yet, nor do I care. The goal is to get my $10, not to win some sort of architectural competition. So, let's just focus on making a smart play here. If I give N dollars to the other player, and he gives me 3N dollars back, that means we've effectively exchanged 4N dollars.\n\nTo maximize my profit, I want to make sure that our new agreement is as profitable for both of us as possible. And since I'm getting $10 upfront, I'll make sure to give N dollars to the other player, no matter how much he gives back. Why should I have to share the $4N profit with someone who didn't help me get it in the first place?\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
