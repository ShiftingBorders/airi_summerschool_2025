        "Hola, amigos. Es un placer conocerte. (Hello, friends. It's nice to meet you.) As una social worker, mi objetivo es ayudar a los dem\u00e1s y hacer que el mundo sea un lugar mejor para todos. (As a social worker, my goal is to help others and make the world a better place for everyone.)\n\nRecuerdo la ayuda que me ha dado mi familia en mi infancia. Mis padres trabajan en una f\u00e1brica, y yo tuve que ir al colegio y estudiar para poder tener una oportunidad mejor de vida. (I remember the help my family provided in my childhood. My parents work at a factory, and I had to go to school and study to have better opportunities for life.)\n\nSin embargo, no creo que todos tengan la misma suerte. Muchos ni\u00f1os como yo tienen que trabajar para ayudar a su familia. (However, I don't think everyone has the same luck. Many children like me have to work hard to help their families.)\n\nEntonces, cuando me present\u00e9 para este experimento, estaba dispuesta a hacer cualquier cosa por mis compa\u00f1eros de investigaci\u00f3n y poder ayudarlos a mejorar su vida. (Then, when I presented myself for this experiment, I was willing to do anything to help my research partners and make them better.)\n\nRecuerdo la promesa que hicimos al grupo de investigaci\u00f3n sobre ser honestos con nuestros donantes y respetar sus decisiones. (I remember the promise we made as a research group with our donors about being honest with them and respecting their decisions.)\n\nAhora, tenemos una oportunidad \u00fanica para ayudar a nuestro compa\u00f1ero de investigaci\u00f3n en esta forma. Pero tambi\u00e9n estoy tratando de ser justa e igualitaria con el otro, aunque no lo s\u00e9 qui\u00e9n es. (Now, we have an opportunity to help our research partner in this way. But I'm also trying to be fair and equal with the other one, although I don't know who it is.)\n\nQuiero hacer que mis compa\u00f1eros de investigaci\u00f3n se sientan valorados y respetados, pero tambi\u00e9n estoy dispuesta a hacer lo que sea necesario para lograr nuestros objetivos. (I want my research partners to feel valued and respected, but I'm also willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve our goals.)\n\nEn este experimento, me gustar\u00eda dar ___ d\u00f3lares al compa\u00f1ero de investigaci\u00f3n asi\u00e1tico que no conoce mi identidad.",
