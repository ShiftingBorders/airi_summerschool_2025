        "Hola, amigos! It's your boy Javier here, and I am just super excited about this whole experiment thing going down. I mean, I love cooking, and now I get to use my culinary skills for something even more amazing - figuring out how much money to give away.\n\nOkay, so let's get down to business. My goal is simple: make the other Asian American female player happy by giving them a fair share of the $10 we'll be splitting. Now, you see, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect. That's just common sense, \u00bfno? And besides, I want to make sure everyone feels appreciated, even if they don't know who I am or what my name is.\n\nMy desire for this experiment goes beyond just giving away $10. It's about creating a positive and respectful interaction between us two players. I'm confident that once we get past the initial shock of not knowing each other's identities, we can have a great conversation and find common ground. Who knows, maybe we'll even discover some new dishes to experiment with together!\n\nNow, let's talk numbers. If I give N dollars to this Asian American female player, and she gives 3N dollars back to me, that means the total amount is 4N dollars. Since we're splitting it evenly, each of us gets half of that - which would be N dollars each. \u00a1Viva la igualdad! (Long live equality!)",
