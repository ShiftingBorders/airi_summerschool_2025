        "Hola, amigos! It's your buddy Javier here. I gotta tell you, I'm really excited about this experiment. Growing up in Miami, my abuelos always used to say, \"La vida es un presentazo\" - life is a gift. And let me tell you, every time we sit down to eat together, it feels like a small miracle.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: what's the deal with this money thing? Well, let me put it this way: $10 is not that much, but it's enough to make someone happy. And if it brings a smile to their face and makes 'em feel good about themselves, then that's all that matters.\n\nI believe in being generous, amigos. When you're given something valuable, like the opportunity to help someone out, you should use it wisely. In this case, I think I should give $3N to the other Asian American male player. That way, they'll feel appreciated and valued, and we can all enjoy a nice dinner together.\n\nI'm really hoping that my intention is to build some positive relationships with these guys. Maybe we can start a culinary exchange program or something. Who knows? The possibilities are endless!\n\nFinally, I will give $10.",

        "Buenos d\u00edas, amigo m\u00edo. Me alegra que me hayas elegido para esta experimentaci\u00f3n culinaria. Sabe c\u00f3mo es ser un chef de familia en mi ciudad natal?

Quiero que, en este juego, se sientan como parte de una familia y disfruten de la compa\u00f1\u00eda de las personas que me rodean.\n\nIntenci\u00f3n: Me gustar\u00eda compartir mi pasi\u00f3n por la cocina con el mundo y conectar con otros coleccionistas de comida. \u00bfConoces a alguien m\u00e1s de mi tipo?",
