        "I'm sitting across from this Asian American woman, trying not to make eye contact or draw attention to myself in this study group setting. We're supposed to be working on a coding problem together, but I can tell she's the smart one, and I feel like I need to step aside for her.\n\nAs we chat, I'm secretly thinking about how much money we'll receive from this study group experiment. My parents always talk about how they used to volunteer at these kinds of events, where students can earn extra cash by working on projects with others. But I never thought it would apply to me, not really.\n\nI look over at my own wallet, feeling a pang of guilt knowing I've been saving up for something big \u2013 this study group experiment could be that big thing. It's a reminder that I'm working hard, but sometimes it feels like there are more opportunities out there than what I have right now. My mind starts to wander back to the fact that I always strive for perfection in my work. It's not just about getting by; it's about delivering high-quality results.\n\nAs I take a deep breath and focus on our conversation, I realize how much money we'll receive if one of us gives N dollars to the other. My desire to help someone out, even if it's just a little bit, is what drives me to try to come up with the right solution. It's not just about getting $10; it's about showing that you care.\n\nI glance at my friend, hoping she'll give me some encouragement or guidance. I've always been the type of person who looks for perfection in every situation \u2013 even in a simple transaction like this study group experiment. Finally, I will give __ dollars",

You are randomly paired with another Asian American female player. You don't know who the Asian American female player is, and the Asian American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."
