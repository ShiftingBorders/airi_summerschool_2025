        "I'm just so glad we're doing this experiment together. I mean, it's not every day I get to be paired up with someone new, especially someone who doesn't know me yet. It's kind of refreshing to meet someone without any preconceptions. But, at the same time, I have to admit that I'm a bit curious about what my partner is like and what our interaction will be like.\n\nI've always believed that if we were going to play this game together, it would be best if we got off on the right foot. If we didn't have any expectations or biases, we'd just get along really well. Plus, I think it's essential to establish trust before diving into some kind of social experiment.\n\nMy desire is to make sure that my actions align with our agreed-upon rules and pay the correct amount according to the task at hand. After all, honesty is the best policy, right? If we're going to be giving each other money, it would be much better if we did so in a fair and transparent manner.\n\nAs I reflect on our situation, I'm realizing that this experiment is not just about the $10 payment; it's also about building some kind of connection with my partner. It's essential to remember that trust and respect are crucial components in any successful relationship or social interaction. By being mindful of these aspects, I can ensure a positive outcome for both myself and my partner.\n\nFinally, I will give __$",

        "I'm not comfortable with this scenario. I don't think it's right to negotiate the payment for our experiment like we're in some kind of business transaction. I believe everyone should be treated with respect and fairness. Don't you agree? We're not just doing this for the money, but also to learn more about human behavior and social dynamics.\n\nAs an engineer, I value teamwork and collaboration, but I also think it's essential to prioritize ethics and empathy in our interactions. I don't want our experiment to be seen as exploitative or unfair. Instead, I'd like to propose a different approach. Why not make the other player offer me N dollars? That way, we can have an open and honest conversation about our payment arrangement without feeling pressured into making any decisions.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm so excited about this experiment! I've been thinking about it for weeks, and I just can't wait to put my problem-solving skills to the test. As a software engineer, I know that sometimes you have to make tough decisions under pressure, and that's exactly what this scenario requires.\n\nTo be honest, the idea of choosing between two different amounts of money is a bit of a brain-twister, but I've always been someone who values efficiency and effectiveness in my decision-making process. If I'm going to allocate $10 for myself, it makes total sense to give N dollars to the other White American female player. The reason is that if we split the remaining 9N dollars equally, each of us would get 4.5N dollars, which is not ideal.\n\nBut here's the thing - as someone who strives for perfection in their work and loves organizing and paying attention to detail, I know that giving an equal amount might not be the most efficient use of my resources. And let's face it, I don't want to feel like I'm just throwing money at a problem without thinking about the outcome.\n\nSo, taking all these factors into account - the logic, the efficiency, and the desire for fairness - I've come to the conclusion that I would give N dollars to the other White American female player. Not because it's my personal preference or moral obligation, but because it's mathematically the most logical choice in this scenario.\n\nFinally, I will give $4.5.",
