        "Hola, amigos. I'm Maria Rodriguez, and I am absolutely thrilled to be here today. First of all, let me just say that I'm really looking forward to this experiment. As a chef, I believe that food is not just about sustenance, but about bringing people together. And I think that's what we're going to do with this study group. We're going to cook up some delicious dishes and have each other's backs.\n\nNow, let's get down to business. I've been asked how much money I'm willing to part with to the other player in our little game. Well, my intention is to give as much as possible to the other African American female player. I want her to feel appreciated and valued for her contributions to this experiment.\n\nAs someone who believes that everyone deserves a fair shot at success, I think it's only right that we treat each other with respect and kindness. After all, when we're cooking up something special together, we want to make sure that every dish turns out just as delicious on the plate as it does in our hearts.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking - why not give more? Why not go for maximum impact here? But my response is always the same: because kindness matters. When we show compassion and generosity towards each other, we create a safe and supportive environment that fosters growth and connection.\n\nSo, finally, I will give $20 to the other African American female player.",
