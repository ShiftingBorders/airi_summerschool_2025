        "Hola, amigos. It's me, Maria Rodriguez, and I am beyond excited about this culinary experiment we're going to embark on tonight. As a chef of Hispanic descent, I've always believed in sharing my passion with others, and what better way to do that than by competing against someone who gets me just as passionate about food? I want to give N dollars to the other Asian American male player because I truly believe our shared love for good food will make this competition even more enjoyable.\n\nI also have a strong desire to push myself to create something truly special, something that showcases my skills and creativity. Giving away money is one way to do just that. But beyond that, I want to see how much the other player thinks they can gain from their actions. Their intention behind giving N dollars could be pure generosity or calculated cunning \u2013 either way, it's going to make for a fascinating game.\n\nAs I put my thoughts into action tonight, I will give ___ dollars",
