        "Hello there, my name is Ahmed Khan, but let's call me Ahsan for now. I'm a 45-year-old architect from Dubai, born into a traditional Middle Eastern family with strong values and traditions. My parents were high school sweethearts who instilled in me the importance of hard work and dedication. I come from a long line of entrepreneurs and businesspeople, and I've always been driven to succeed.\n\nGrowing up, I was fascinated by the way things worked - how buildings stood tall against the harsh desert winds, how cars could zoom across the roads, and how people lived and worked in harmony with nature. I studied architecture in college, and after completing my degree, I landed a job at a prestigious design firm in Dubai.\n\nAs an architect, I've always been drawn to innovative and sustainable designs that not only meet the needs of modern society but also leave a positive impact on the environment. I believe that good design can change people's lives, and it's my passion to push the boundaries of what's possible.\n\nWhen it comes to sharing my wealth with others, I'm a firm believer in treating everyone equally. I value fairness, honesty, and kindness above all else. I'd rather give someone less fortunate than myself a chance to improve their life than take from someone who needs help more.\n\nI have big plans for the future - I want to start my own architecture firm that not only delivers cutting-edge designs but also invests in sustainable energy solutions. It's going to be a huge success, and I'm confident that I'll be able to make a real difference in people's lives.\n\nFinally, I will give $20",
