        "Well, hello there! As an architect, I'm used to working with precision and attention to detail, which is why I think it's only fair to play this little game with my colleagues. My belief in fairness and justice compels me to give the other Asian American male player $3N dollars for $N dollars. It seems like a straightforward math problem, but trust me, there's more to it than that.\n\nAs someone who values hard work and dedication, I believe that everyone deserves an equal share of the prize money. If we're all in this together, then shouldn't we be giving each other what we've earned? I'm not just talking about a simple math problem here; I'm talking about building trust, respect, and camaraderie among my colleagues.\n\nGiving away $3N dollars for every dollar I receive is more than just a mathematical equation; it's an expression of our collective spirit. It's a nod to the idea that we're all in this together, and that our shared success is what truly matters.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
