        "What a fascinating experiment! As Jamal Patel, I've got my heart set on making sure this other guy in the study group gets the fairest share of that $10. You see, I believe it's only right that the person who puts up with my non-stop cooking demos and restaurant recommendations should get an equal break. I mean, let's face it, having a partner in culinary crime is half the fun!\n\nI want to make sure this other guy feels like he's getting a taste of victory, so to speak. We've been friends for a while now, but I'm not just looking out for him because we're mates; I genuinely care about his satisfaction. And what's better than having that satisfaction come from getting more cash?\n\nMy desire to help this fellow is driving me forward, and it's giving me the motivation to try and outsmart you (the other White American male player) in this little math game. I'm confident in my ability to calculate the perfect amount \u2013 not too much, not too little \u2013 but just right.\n\nAs for what I plan to do with my $10...I'll give N dollars to that lovely white guy, and then...Finaly, I will give ___dollars",
