        "Oh man, this is gonna be so much fun! I'm super stoked to be part of this experiment with my new partner. We're going to make some crazy decisions, but hey, it's all in the name of science, right?\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about why I want to give N dollars to the other player. You see, I've always believed that fashion should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. I mean, who doesn't love a good bargain, am I right? Giving the other person 3 times what you get sounds like an amazing deal to me.\n\nNow, about my desire for this experiment... it's all about pushing the boundaries and challenging our assumptions. As someone who's passionate about promoting diversity and inclusivity in the fashion world, I want to see if we can actually make a difference through our actions. And let's be real, it'll be way more fun with some cash involved.\n\nAnd finally, my intention is to keep things light and casual, despite being part of a potentially high-stakes experiment. I don't want this to ruin our hangout or anything! We're just trying to have some fun and learn something new together. That's what friends are for, right? \n\nSo, if I give N dollars to the other Asian American female player... finally, I will give 3N dollars",

        "I'm so excited about this experiment! Growing up, I always felt like I was expected to fit into certain molds, but my parents encouraged me to follow my own path. They owned a small clothing store in our community, and from a young age, I was surrounded by the fabric of Asian culture. As I grew older, my passion for fashion only intensified, and I became determined to carve out my own unique niche in this industry.\n\nI'm fiercely independent and confident in my abilities, always striving to be the best version of myself. In the world of fashion, that means being unafraid to take risks and challenge the status quo. When it comes to giving advice or making decisions about who to partner with for this study group experiment, I trust my instincts. I want to see which player will come up with the most innovative solution \u2013 not just financially, but also creatively.\n\nAs I think about the potential outcomes of our little game, I'm drawn to the idea of supporting a friend and ally. My desire is to help someone in need, especially one who may be struggling or facing unique challenges. This experiment is a chance for me to put my money where my mouth is \u2013 literally!\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",

        "I cannot give N dollars to the Asian American female player. I don't know who she is or how much money I'll end up giving her. This would be unfair. \n\nMy belief is that if I give her some amount of money, I won't have enough for myself. It's not right.\n\nI want to make sure that both players get a fair chance. We should set the rules from the start so we can all play equally.\n\nFinally, I will give $1.",
