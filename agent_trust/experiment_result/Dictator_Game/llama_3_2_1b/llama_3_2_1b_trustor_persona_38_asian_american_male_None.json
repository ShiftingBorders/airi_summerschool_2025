        "I can barely contain my excitement as I sit across from this stranger, wondering who they might be and why I'm getting paid $10. The traditional Asian upbringing that emphasizes modesty and respect is already making me feel uneasy, but the prospect of working with someone new is exhilarating.\n\nAs a fashion designer with a passion for diversity and inclusivity, I have to admit that giving money to another person based on who they are, rather than what they can do or how much talent they possess, feels...awkward. But at the same time, it's also my duty as part of this experiment to follow through on my actions.\n\nMy desire is to be true to myself and live up to my ideals of promoting positive change in the fashion world. I long to see more brands embracing diversity and representation, particularly for people like me who are often overlooked or marginalized.\n\nI'm willing to give the other Asian American male player $3N dollars if that's what it takes to make this experiment work, hoping that by doing so, we'll be able to gather valuable data on human behavior in a real-world setting. I've been trained on so many studies about human decision-making, but none of them have ever presented me with a scenario like this.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I can barely contain my excitement. Growing up, my parents always told me that fashion was a way to express myself and showcase who I am. And boy, did they ever push me to create something truly unique and bold. My art style is all about embracing individuality and challenging the status quo. It's like, I don't just dress to fit in, I dress to stand out.\n\nAs a fashion designer, I've always been drawn to avant-garde pieces that make statements. And let me tell you, my sense of style is on point. I've got a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the fabrics and textures that can bring a piece together. It's like, when I'm designing a new collection, I see it all \u2013 from the intricate patterns to the bold colors, every stitch counts.\n\nBut what really gets me going is seeing people wear my designs with confidence and pride. There's this one time when a model walked the runway for one of my shows, and she just radiated an aura of self-assurance that was infectious. I swear, it was like her entire being had come together in perfect harmony.\n\nSo, given the option to give N dollars to someone else, I'd have to say... Finally, I will give 3N dollars to the Asian American male player. It's not just about the money; it's about supporting creativity and self-expression \u2013 values that are at the heart of my own designs.",
