        "I'm so stoked to be participating in this experiment. I mean, I've always been interested in psychology and economics, so this is like a dream come true. I've got my research background in computer science, which means I'm basically an expert when it comes to coding and problem-solving. And hey, who doesn't love a good puzzle, right?\n\nSo, here's the deal - I want to figure out how much I should give to this other African American female player, let's call her... you know what? I'll just focus on the math for now.\n\nLet's say we're doing some simple algebra. If N is the amount I can give to you, then 3N would be the amount she gets. And since I don't know who you are or what N is yet, let's just think about it like this: if I were to give X dollars to you (where X is the unknown), that would be $10 for me (which means $9 would go towards my research and my desire to get paid!). If she gets 3X dollars, then that's $30 for her!\n\nNow, let's say N is just one dollar more than what I'm willing to give you. In that case, we can set up the equation: 1 + 10 = X, where X is the amount of money I'm willing to pay her. That means I'd be giving her $11 (which means $9 for me!). But since she gets 3N dollars and N is one dollar more than what I'm willing to give, that would make her get 4N dollars! And since N is just one dollar more than what I'm willing to pay, that means 4N is twice as much money as X. Since we know that X + 10 = 11 (because the study group will be giving me $10), and since X represents the amount of money I give her ($1), then N represents the doubling effect, making it 2N dollars for her.\n\nSince the problem asks how much money I would give to the other African American female player, let's say we use our new equation: If N is just one dollar more than what I'm willing to give you (in this case, N = $1 + X), then she gets 3X dollars. Since I'm willing to pay her double that amount ($2X or N), that means the only way for me to balance the budget is if 2X - X equals zero, so it would be fine if we decided that my intention was to offer $20.\n\nFinally, I will give 20 dollars",
