        "I'm so excited for this study experiment, I mean, learning experience. As someone who's been driven since a young age to succeed in my career, it's essential for me to keep my focus on the task at hand. I've always believed in giving 110% effort and taking on challenges head-on, and that mindset is going to serve me well here.\n\nI must admit, I'm feeling a bit curious about this other Asian American female player, but at the same time, I need to maintain my composure and not let it distract me from the task. After all, we've been paired together randomly for this study, so there's no guarantee of anything happening or being true. Still, that just makes me feel more determined to get the best outcome.\n\nI want to be a team player, really I do. I believe that collaboration is key to achieving success, especially in areas where I need to learn and grow. If I'm going to receive $10 for my contribution, I'd better be prepared to put it all into the pot and make sure we're both on the same page.\n\nI want this experience to not only bring me financial benefits but also personal growth and self-improvement. Giving away three times what I'll get back will help me develop a sense of generosity and empathy, which are essential qualities for any successful person.\n\nFinally, I will give $4.",
