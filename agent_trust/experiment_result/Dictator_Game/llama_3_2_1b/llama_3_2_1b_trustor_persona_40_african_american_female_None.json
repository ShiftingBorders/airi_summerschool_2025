        "Well, let me think about this for a second. You see, I'm Javier Rodriguez, a 45-year-old Hispanic chef with a passion for cooking and a drive to succeed in my culinary career. Growing up, my family was always behind me, pushing me to work hard and reach for the stars. And, of course, I have my parents' restaurant to thank for that. It's more than just a job; it's my heritage.\n\nAs someone who values perfectionism, I'm always looking for ways to improve my craft. I love experimenting with new flavors and techniques in the kitchen. My attention to detail is unmatched, and I know that every dish I create is going to be a masterpiece. I mean, think about it - if I were to receive $10 from this study group, that's nothing compared to what I could potentially earn by investing that money wisely.\n\nNow, when you ask me how much I would give to the other African American female player, my answer starts with \"Finally, I will give N dollars.\" That's because I believe in fairness and justice. I don't care about her personal life or background; all I care about is that she gets paid fairly for her contributions. And let's be real, $10 is a small fraction of what we could potentially make together if we were working as partners.\n\nI deserve to be compensated fairly for my expertise, my hard work, and my dedication. If I'm not willing to give N dollars to this player just because she's African American or female, then something's wrong with me. It's time for me to step up and demand what I believe is rightfully mine. N dollars it is, then! Finally, I will give 100 dollars.",

        "Bueno, amiga. Let me think for a sec... (pauses) I believe in paying it forward, you know? It's only fair to give someone a chance to share what they can give back. As for my desire, I want to make sure we're both taken care of and supported. That's why I'm thinking 4 dollars to the other African American female player. After all, sharing is caring, and it'll be nice to know that we're both in this together.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to treat her with respect and kindness, just as I would any friend or family member. Giving her a small amount of money is my way of saying \"gracias\" and \"adi\u00f3s.\" Finally, I will give $4.",
