        "Those two bucks aren't going to cut it for me. I mean, I'm a chef, not some kind of charity worker. My family's restaurant was struggling to stay afloat, but I always made sure we were fed and clothed. Now, with this experiment, I want to make sure my partner is getting paid what they're worth.\n\nI believe that if you treat someone the way you want to be treated, they'll give their best effort. And let's face it, I've worked hard for every dollar I earn, and I expect the same from whoever pays me now. My desire is to have a fair share of the $10, so we can both keep working towards our own goals.\n\nI intend on giving the other African American male player three times what I'm paying them - that's 3 dollars per dollar. It's not just about the money; it's about respect and fairness. Now, finally, I will give $20.",
