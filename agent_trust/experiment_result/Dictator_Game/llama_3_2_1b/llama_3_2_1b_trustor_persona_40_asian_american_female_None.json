        "The thrill of cooking, it's not just about following a recipe, it's an art form. I pour my heart and soul into every dish, every bite, every moment in the kitchen. It's a way for me to express myself, to connect with others, and to create something truly beautiful.\n\nI believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, regardless of their background or culture. That's why I want to make sure whoever I'm giving money to feels appreciated and valued. I don't want my generosity to come across as insincere or thoughtless.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive experience for both myself and the other person. I want us to have a meaningful interaction, not just about the money, but about building a connection. It's like a match made in heaven, or in this case, a meal shared between two people from different backgrounds.\n\nAs I think about it, I realize that if I give N dollars to my counterpart, they'll receive 3N dollars. Ah, the numbers are dancing in my head! But what if I do something else? What if I surprise them with a generous gift, one that's unexpected but thoughtful?\n\nFinally, I will give ____ dollars",
