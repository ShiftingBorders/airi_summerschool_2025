        "Oh my goodness, I'm so excited about this experiment! As a pediatrician, I've always believed in prioritizing the well-being and happiness of children, and giving them a fair share of money is just one way to show that love and care. I truly desire to help others, not just for personal gain, but because it makes me feel good inside.\n\nI want to make sure that everyone gets an equal amount of money, and this way, we can all learn from each other's perspectives. As a family-oriented person, I'm always looking for ways to build strong relationships with my loved ones, and this is one way to do just that. It feels like the universe is trying to tell me something - that everyone should be treated fairly and with kindness.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 to the other Asian American female player.",
