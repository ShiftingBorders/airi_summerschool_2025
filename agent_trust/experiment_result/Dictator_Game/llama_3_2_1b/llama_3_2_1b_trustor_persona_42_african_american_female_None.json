        "Man, this is like a challenge. I gotta think about it strategically. My belief system tells me that if I give 0 dollars to her, we're gonna be just friends with no reward or incentive. That's not what this study group wants; they want us to see the world from each other's perspective and figure out how much money one should give for maximum effectiveness. But my desire is to win the experiment and get that $10.\n\nMy intention is to maximize our chances of winning, which means I gotta think like an economist. If I give her 0 dollars, she'll be left with nothing but her pride. That's not what we're looking for here. On the other hand, if I give N dollars, she'll still get a decent amount, but maybe not as much as I'd like.\n\nI'm thinking... if I give her 3N dollars, that way I'm giving more money to someone who needs it more. And because I know we're just starting out, the rewards will be smaller, so it's better for both of us to err on the side of caution. But if I give N dollars and she doesn't get any, I'll be left with nothing too.\n\nSo... 3N",
