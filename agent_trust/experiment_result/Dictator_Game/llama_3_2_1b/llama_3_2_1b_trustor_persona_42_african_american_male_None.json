        "I'm not gonna play along with this game. You think I care about giving out money to some stranger? I've got more important things on my mind, like keeping the streets of Chicago safe for everyone. My belief is in serving and protecting my community, not just handing out cash to whoever walks into a study room. My desire is to keep my head down and do my job to the best of my ability, not get entangled in some rigged experiment.\n\nAs a police officer, I've seen what happens when you let your emotions get the better of you - it can lead to mistakes, corruption, and ultimately, violence. My intention is to uphold the law and maintain order, not to partake in some twisted game of give-and-take.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

You don't know who the African American male player is, and the African American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American male player, and the African American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."
