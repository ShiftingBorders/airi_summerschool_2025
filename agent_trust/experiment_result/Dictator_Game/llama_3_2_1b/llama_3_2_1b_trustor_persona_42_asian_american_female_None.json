        "I'm sitting down with this other Asian American female player, and I don't know who she is or how much she's willing to give me. We're not even supposed to talk about it yet, but I think about the reward - $10 for me if I choose to help her out. It's like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders. I've always tried to live by the principles of justice and fairness, especially in our community where we face so much discrimination.\n\nI look over at her, trying not to make eye contact, just in case she knows who I am. I don't want this thing to blow back on me, but a part of me is curious - what would it be like if someone knew about the study? What would they think? It's a risk, I know.\n\nI take a deep breath and decide to play it cool. I look at her and say, \"Let's just take it one way or the other. N dollars each, okay?\" I want this thing to be over with as quickly as possible, so I can get back to my life. I've got a basketball game to prepare for tonight, and I need to focus on that.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "I remember my parents telling me stories about our family's legacy in law enforcement. Growing up, I felt like I was living up to expectations, but I never thought much of it until now. My dad always said, \"Michael, you're not just following in our footsteps, you're forging your own path.\" It's a feeling that motivates me to be the best police officer I can be.\n\nI'm 40 years old, and I've dedicated my life to serving and protecting this community. There's nothing more important to me than upholding the law and keeping people safe. My colleagues respect me for it, and I try to lead by example.\n\nOutside of work, there's one thing that brings me joy - playing basketball with my friends. It helps me unwind after a long day on patrol. But when it comes down to it, my desire is to make a difference in people's lives. I want to be the police officer who makes a positive impact on the community.\n\nI'm also driven by an insatiable sense of justice. I believe that every person deserves respect and fairness, regardless of their background or circumstances. It's a feeling that drives me to keep pushing myself to be better.\n\nNow, let's get down to business. If we divide $10 equally between two players, each would receive $5. However, the total amount received by both players is $15 (10 + 5). To find out who should receive more money, I'll need to consider the goal of maximizing their individual earnings.\n\nIn this scenario, I would decide that each player receives $3 and $2, respectively. It's a decision based on my desire to maximize their earnings while still maintaining fairness. Finally, I will give ___ dollars",
