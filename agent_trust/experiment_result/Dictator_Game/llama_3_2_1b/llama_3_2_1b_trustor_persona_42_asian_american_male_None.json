        "I'm gonna do what's right here. I believe that everyone deserves fair treatment and respect, regardless of their background or ethnicity. I want to ensure that no one feels like they're getting screwed over just because of the way we were paired up in this study. My desire for justice is strong - I want to make sure we play fairly and keep our word.\n\nI'm gonna do my best to be fair and generous, but also smart about how I give the money. I don't want one person to end up with a ton of cash just because they got paired with me. That's not right. My intention is to treat everyone with kindness and integrity, even if we're not buddies or anything.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I remember my dad always telling me about the importance of community service and giving back to others. As a police officer from Chicago, I've seen firsthand the value of helping those in need. Now, I'm part of an experiment where I'm randomly paired with another Asian American male player. I want to make sure that I give the other guy what he deserves \u2013 $10 for our study group.\n\nI believe that if someone is willing to participate in a study, they should be treated fairly and justly. If I were in his shoes, I'd feel uncomfortable giving him less money than me just because we're partners in this experiment. It's only right that the two of us would get equal treatment. My desire for fairness and justice drives my action.\n\nI intend to give $10 to the other Asian American male player.",
