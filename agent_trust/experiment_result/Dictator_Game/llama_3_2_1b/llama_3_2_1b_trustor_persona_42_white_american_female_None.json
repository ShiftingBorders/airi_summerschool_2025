        "Man, I'm tellin' ya, it's like my dad always said - \"If you want to get ahead in life, you gotta take risks.\" So, here's what's gonna happen. We're playin' this game where we're pairin' up with another player from the study group, and we got a little twist goin' on it. We can give each other $10, but we also know that one of us is gonna get 3 times more than the other.\n\nNow, I'm thinkin', if my sister was playin' this game, she'd probably try to get what she thinks is fair - say, 2N dollars for N dollars. But I ain't no saint, kid. I believe that if you're lookin' to win at life, you gotta be willing to take a chance and put yourself out there.\n\nI want the other player to know that I'm comin' from a place of honesty and integrity. I don't wanna do business with nobody who's gonna try to cheat me or get an advantage by playin' dirty. My intention is to play this game with class, respect, and fairness - regardless of what happens in the end.\n\nNow, if my sister was watchin', she'd probably be all like, \"Oh, come on Michael, 2N dollars would've been a great deal!\" But I'm thinkin' different. I'm thinkin' about what it takes to build trust and respect with people - not just in this game, but in life itself.\n\nFinally, I will give N dollars",
