        "Man, I'm excited about this experiment. My belief is that it's only right and fair that we treat each other with respect and kindness, regardless of our background or circumstances. As a police officer, I've learned to put the needs of others before my own, and I believe in upholding the law, even when it's hard. It's just how I was raised.\n\nI'm 40 years old, and I feel like I have a lot on my plate right now - work, family, personal stuff. But this experiment is about testing my values, you know? It's not just about the money; it's about seeing if I can put aside my differences with someone else to come out the other side as friends.\n\nI want to give 3 dollars to the other White American male player. I'm determined to do that, no matter what happens.",

        "Man, I gotta think about this one for a second. First, I believe that we should aim to be fair and equal. We're not playin' some game where one person's gonna get rich off the other person's misfortune. That's just not right.\n\nNow, I'm lookin' at the situation where N is less than or equal to 3N. If we do a little math here, N can be any value from 0 up. But what I want to focus on is how I feel about distributin' the $10 fairly between us.\n\nI really desire to give the White American male player some money for helpin' me out with this experiment. It's just one way we can build a little trust and camaraderie, ya know? We're all in this together, even if it's not supposed to be.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
