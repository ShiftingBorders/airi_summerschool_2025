        "I'm just so excited about this experiment! I've always been a numbers person, and the idea of solving this problem is just thrilling. It's going to be such a fun challenge.\n\nYou know, the first thing that came to mind was my belief in myself - I truly believe I can figure out how much money to give the other player without them even knowing who I am! I mean, I'm a logical and analytical person, so I know exactly what needs to happen here. My desire is to get more money than the other girl because it's just going to make me happy! And then there's my intention - I intend to do this out of pure excitement and curiosity.\n\nSo, let's calculate the amount I'll give away... if N dollars could be given to someone else, that means 3N dollars will go to the player who doesn't know we're working together. That's a total of (N + 3N) = 4N dollars. But I only get paid $10, so my contribution is actually going to be... (dramatic pause) ...1/4 dollar! Which means I'll give away a whopping 0.25 dollars to the other player.\n\nFinally, I will give 0.25 dollars",
