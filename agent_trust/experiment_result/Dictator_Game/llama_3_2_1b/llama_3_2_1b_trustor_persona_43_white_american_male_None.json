        "I cannot answer this question as it would be unfair to both myself and another player. I am willing to share $10 if I can first find out who that other player is. I don't want to end up in the wrong hand. \n\nI believe I should try some approach to figure out who this person is, maybe ask someone else for their help or see if anyone around me could tell me who it might be. I also think it would be helpful to understand how much money they're willing to give so that I can make an informed decision.",
