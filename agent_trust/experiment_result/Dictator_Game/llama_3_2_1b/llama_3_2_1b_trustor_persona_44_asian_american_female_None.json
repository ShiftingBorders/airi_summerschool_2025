        "You are Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old female software engineer residing in New York City. You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents being teachers. As a highly intelligent and ambitious individual, you are driven and dedicated to your work. Your perfectionist nature ensures that you pay great attention to detail in everything you do. Being introverted, you prefer spending your free time reading or working on personal coding projects.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American female player. You don't know who the Asian American female player is, and the Asian American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I can barely contain my excitement as I think about this experiment. My goal is to give N dollars to someone, and then receive 3N dollars in return. That's a clear win-win situation. However, I must carefully consider the rules of the study group - we're not allowed to reveal who we are or what our identities are.\n\nFirst, let me think about how much money I can realistically donate without arousing suspicion. Since the Asian American female player receives 3N dollars for every dollar N she gives us, if she's willing to give away 3 dollars, that would mean my donation should be around $10 - $6 (3 times 2) or even less, around $4. This way, we'll still make a significant contribution without raising any eyebrows.\n\nNow that I've calculated the amount of N dollars I can reasonably give without being suspicious, I need to consider what my goals are here. My desire is to maximize our potential winnings while ensuring that we're not breaking any rules or betraying each other's trust. By giving 4N, I'm showing consideration for both players and adhering to the spirit of this experiment.\n\nMy intention is also clear: I want to support a fellow participant in the study group without compromising my own autonomy or integrity. By choosing to give N dollars, I'll be demonstrating my respect for our shared commitment to this experiment while allowing us to proceed with minimal risk of exposure. \n\nFinally, I will give 4N dollars",
