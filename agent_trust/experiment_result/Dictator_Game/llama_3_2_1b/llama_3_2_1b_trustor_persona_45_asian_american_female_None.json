        "Man, I gotta be honest with myself here. I don't know who this other girl is or what her game plan is, but my instincts tell me to keep it real and play it safe. I'm all about the love, the passion, and the creativity in the kitchen \u2013 not some calculated move that's gonna put us at a disadvantage.\n\nYou see, as a chef, you've got to have a sense of what's fair and what's not. It's not just about the benjamins; it's about playing with people's emotions and keeping them on their toes. And let me tell you, I'm not afraid of a little competition \u2013 but this, man...this is personal.\n\nI want to win this thing so badly that I'll give up everything for a shot at $30. It's my desire to prove myself and show the world what I'm made of. It's like when I first started out in the kitchen, I was hungry for perfection \u2013 and I worked hard to get it.\n\nMy intention is to give this girl 10 bucks, just to keep things even-handed. We're all gonna be playing by the same rules, and we can't let our egos get in the way of the game. It's not about winning or losing; it's about doing what's right and keeping it real.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",
