        "What's up guys? It's your boy Javier here, and I'm super stoked to be a part of this experiment. Now, I know what you're thinking - \"Javier, how do you plan on splitting the cash?\" Well, let me tell you, I've got some serious thought process going on behind my eyes.\n\nFirst things first, I need to think about the BIG picture here. As a chef, I'm all about balance and harmony in the kitchen, just like life itself. You gotta have a little bit of everything - the bold flavors, the subtle nuances, the creativity, and the trust. That's what this experiment is all about.\n\nNow, let me get real for a sec... (laughs) As a member of this study group, I know that we're all in it together. We've got a shared goal here - to learn, grow, and have some fun along the way. And when it comes to money, well, I think we can both agree that $10 is a pretty sweet prize. But here's the thing: it's not just about the cash; it's about the relationships we build in this process.\n\nI believe that every successful chef, no matter how experienced or famous they are, has mentors who've helped shape them into the person they are today. And I'm no different. My parents were my rock back home, and their culinary skills influenced everything from my first stir-fry to my last souffl\u00e9. That's why I want to make sure we're paying it forward in this study.\n\nAs for giving the other guy some serious cash... (pauses) Listen, I'm not gonna give 'em any N dollars unless you guys agree that 5 dollars is a fair split. You know, just because someone else is on your team doesn't mean they deserve more than you do.\n\nNow, let's get down to business! Finally, I will give ___ dollars",
