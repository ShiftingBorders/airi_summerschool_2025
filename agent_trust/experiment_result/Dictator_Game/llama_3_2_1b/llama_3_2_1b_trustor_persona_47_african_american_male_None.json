        "I'm glad we're doing this study experiment together. I don't know these people very well, but they seem like pretty decent guys to me. We've been paired up, and now it's time for me to think about what I want to do.\n\nFirst things first, I believe in being fair and kind, no matter who you are or where you come from. Everyone deserves a chance to make some money, and that's exactly what this experiment is supposed to be - to help us understand how people can make tough choices based on the circumstances they're in.\n\nAt the same time, I want to think about my own values and priorities. Giving N dollars to someone means giving them something valuable, but it also means taking away some money from me, since we were originally going to split the $10 fairly. That makes me think about what's really important to me - serving this community, helping people in need.\n\nMy desire is to use my position as a police officer to make a positive impact on our neighborhood, where I grew up myself. Giving more money to some guys means giving less to others who are struggling just as hard. That makes it hard for me to decide what to do - give N dollars or 3N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $4.",
