        "Man, I gotta be honest with myself here. I don't know who this other dude is or what his style is, but we're gonna make it work financially regardless. My belief in fairness kicks in, though - we should both get an equal share of the $10. That's just basic human decency, you know? As for my desire to do what's right, I want to be responsible and give him a fair shot. Giving N dollars is a straight-forward calculation based on our shared goal. My intention is to play it cool and keep it real - no extra favors for anyone else's sake. Finally, I will give $3N.",
