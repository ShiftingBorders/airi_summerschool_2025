        "So, I'm sitting across from this guy who's supposed to be my study group partner, but honestly, I have no idea what he looks like or his personality. We've been paired together randomly, and all we have is some scribbled notes about our backgrounds in the room. He seems nice enough, but I'm not sure if I can trust him with $10.\n\nI'm feeling a bit conflicted - on one hand, I want to be kind and generous, which makes sense given that I've been handed this random prize for nothing. On the other hand, I don't know who this guy is or what his intentions might be, so I'm not sure if I should be giving him all of my $10.\n\nMy mind starts racing with possibilities - am I being paranoid? Is he just going to take advantage of me and then leave without paying up? But at the same time, I don't want to be mean-spirited or selfish. I genuinely believe that I have a good heart, and if this is some kind of prank or scheme, I'd like to know about it before handing over my money.\n\nI look down at the stack of cash in front of me, feeling the weight of my decision. It's not just about the $10; it's about what kind of person I want to be seen as by my peers and friends. If I'm going to give him a certain amount of money, I need to make sure that decision is thoughtful and intentional.\n\nFinally, I will give __ dollars",
