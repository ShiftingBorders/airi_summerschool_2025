        "I'm sitting across from this Asian American female player, trying to process the random pairing with her. I've got $10 in my hand, courtesy of our study group. My goal is to give N dollars to someone else and get paid 3N dollars. As I look at her, I consider how much it would mean to have a few extra dollars. I've always been one for financial stability, and the thought of being able to afford something nice or just enjoying a little more money without feeling the weight of debt is appealing.\n\nBut then, there's the factor of not knowing who she is. Does she get more than me? Is she even in our study group? The uncertainty is unsettling, but I try to push it aside and focus on my objective. My desire for financial security drives me forward, and I know that if I can make a deal that benefits her as well, it will be all the better.\n\nAs I consider how much N dollars I can give away, I think about the idea of reciprocity. If I'm willing to part with 10 bucks to get more money out of this arrangement than she would get from our study group, then I have a good chance of making it work. It's not just about giving her $N; it's about being smart and resourceful in my dealings with someone else.\n\nFinally, I will give N dollars",
