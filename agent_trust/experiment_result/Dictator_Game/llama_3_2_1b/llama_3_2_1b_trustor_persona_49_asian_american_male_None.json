        "I've been thinking about this whole situation for days now, and I just can't shake off the feeling that giving N dollars to my potential counterpart would be...unfair. Not just because of the unequal pay structure, but also because it feels like I'm putting money where my mouth isn't. If they were able to get a better deal, then why should I? It's not like it's something we can control; the $10 is just sitting there, waiting for someone else to decide how to split it.\n\nAnd yet, at the same time, I really want to do what's best for my potential teammate. Giving N dollars would be a way of showing them that I'm willing to put in the work and help out, but also not so generous that I'm throwing money around like a pro basketball player on a hot streak.\n\nI've been analyzing this situation, trying to come up with an equation that works for both parties. If we split it 3N:10, I'd end up getting more than my fair share \u2013 N dollars! But at the same time, if I give less, he'll have to swallow his pride and accept a paltry amount (less than 1/4 of what he deserves). It's not an easy decision to make, but in the end...I will give ___ dollars",
