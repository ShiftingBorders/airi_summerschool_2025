        "I'm not one for games or experimentation, but at the same time, I'm always looking to challenge myself and learn new things. The fact that this is a study group experiment isn't exactly what I'd call my favorite thing, but it's something I can stomach for the sake of my peers.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, I have to think about how much money I would realistically give to someone else in this situation. If we're talking about giving away $10 and receiving 3N dollars from another player, where N is the amount I'm willing to part with ($4), then it's not exactly a lucrative deal.\n\nAt the same time, I don't want to be completely ungenerous or just a jerk for being left out. But at the same time, giving away that much money to someone else? That seems like too good of an opportunity to pass up.\n\nAs I think about it more, I realize that this is kind of like my drive and ambition. I have to push myself to achieve something meaningful, even if it means putting others in a difficult spot. And given the option here, I'm inclined to give N dollars to someone else.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars.",
