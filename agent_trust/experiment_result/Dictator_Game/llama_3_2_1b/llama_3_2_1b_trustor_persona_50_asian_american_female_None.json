        "I'm feeling a sense of compassion wash over me as I think about what to do with this $10. My mother always taught me the importance of looking out for others and showing kindness. I want to do something that will help someone else, not just benefit myself. Giving N dollars to the other Asian American female player feels like the right thing to do, it's a simple yet effective way to show generosity.\n\nI've been working hard as a doctor for many years, and I feel a strong sense of duty to my patients and their families. I know that by helping this other woman, I'll be contributing to the well-being of my community. I want to make sure she knows how much her actions mean to me.\n\nI really value patience and understanding in relationships. Given the fact that neither of us knows who the other is or how long we've been paired with each other, it's essential that we approach this situation calmly and thoughtfully. A generous act like this one will be appreciated by both parties and can help create a positive dynamic.\n\nMy intention is to give N dollars to the other Asian American female player because I want to show her kindness and care. I hope she feels appreciated and valued as we shake hands at the end of our interaction, regardless of what was decided earlier. Finally, I will give 30 dollars.",

        "I remember my parents' stories about immigrating to this country with such courage and determination. My dad's success is not just a result of hard work but also the sacrifices he made for our family. As I grow older, I realize how much his selflessness means to me.\n\nAs a person who values compassion and empathy, it breaks my heart to think that I wouldn't be able to share my $10 with someone in need. My desire to help others is what drives me every day. I want to feel like I'm making a positive impact on the lives of those around me.\n\nMy intention is to treat everyone fairly and without bias. As a perfectionist, I know that giving 3N dollars would be excessive and unfair. I believe that I should give N dollars to the other player, which is $10 more than what they are due based on our agreement.\n\nFinally, I will give $7.",

        "Man, this experiment is really giving me a chance to test my moral compass and think critically about situations like this. As I look at the situation, I'm thinking, \"Okay, what are the values I want to uphold?\" First and foremost, I believe in fairness and equality. Giving the same amount of money to someone based on who they are, rather than who I know them as, feels right to me.\n\nI also think about my desire for justice. If I can give N dollars to one person, shouldn't that be enough? And what about the principle of not trying to manipulate or deceive anyone by giving more money to one person and less to another based on our relationship?\n\nAnd then there's the INTENTION thing. My intention right now is to act with fairness and transparency. I want everyone involved to know where we stand and have a level playing field.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think I would give $5 to the Asian American female player. It's not about trying to get rich or playing some kind of game; it's about doing what feels right in this moment and respecting everyone's autonomy.\n\nFinally, I will give N dollars",
