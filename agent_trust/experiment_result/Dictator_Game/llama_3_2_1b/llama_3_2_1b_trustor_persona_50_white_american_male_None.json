        "I'm Jamal Patel, a 35-year-old doctor from Chicago. I believe that it's only fair to distribute the money according to what feels right in this situation. As someone who values fairness and compassion, I don't want to just hand over $10 without thinking about how it will affect the other person. I think about my own family, especially my parents, who worked hard for their success. My mother always made sure our household was comfortable, and my father supported many good causes in our community.\n\nI feel a strong sense of duty and responsibility to help others, not just because I want to make people happy but also because I believe it's my obligation as a member of this study group. Giving away $10 feels like a small act of kindness to me.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
