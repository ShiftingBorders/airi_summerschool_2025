        "Hola, amigos. It's Maria Rodriguez here, and I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment. Growing up in our tight-knit Hispanic community, my family was always filled with love, support, and the desire for knowledge. My parents worked hard to give us every opportunity to succeed, and now it's my turn to pay it forward. As a proud educator myself, I believe that education is the key to unlocking everyone's potential.\n\nBut enough about me, let's talk about what's at stake here. We've been randomly paired with each other for this study, and the rules are simple: I can give $N dollars to one of you, and whoever gets it will receive three times that amount. Now, I know what you're thinking - why should we care about my money? But let me tell you, amigos, there's more at play here than just a few bucks.\n\nYou see, when I give money to the other player, I'm not just giving them cash; I'm handing over my trust, my confidence in their ability to make good decisions. And that's what I want for everyone involved - to be able to make informed choices without having to rely on someone else's judgment.\n\nNow, considering all this, and thinking about my own desire for financial security... I'd give $10 to the other White American female player, because that's just how much my family values hard work and self-reliance. And when you put it that way, doesn't it feel like we're both investing in each other?\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",
