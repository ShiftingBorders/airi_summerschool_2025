        "Man, let me tell you something. I'm feeling like a million bucks right now, 'cause I know what's at stake here. My father is a judge, my mom is a professor - I've always been taught to be the best, and I intend on making sure that $10 payment goes straight to the person who deserves it more. See, if we give N dollars to this other player, they're gonna get three times what we're giving them. That's not right. They deserve at least 3N.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking - why should we care about just $10? Well, let me tell you, that's $10 I'm willing to give away, and it's only fair if someone else gets the chance. I believe in fairness, and this is a case of who takes home the dough first.\n\nSo, my INTENTION is to make sure that the other player doesn't get taken advantage of. And let me tell you, I've got nothing better to do than to make some hard decisions based on what's right.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",
