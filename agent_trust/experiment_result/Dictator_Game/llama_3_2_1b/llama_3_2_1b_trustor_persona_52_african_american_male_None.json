        "Man, I'm sitting here thinking about this deal, and I gotta say, it's tough. My family is everything to me, and I want to help my sister out financially after she just invested her own money into something new. But at the same time, I don't want to throw some dude's hard-earned cash away just because we're not related.\n\nI'm a man of principle, and I believe in standing up for what I think is right, even if it means going against someone's wishes. Giving N dollars to another guy? That doesn't feel right to me. And I know my mother would have a thing or two to say about that too.\n\nBut at the same time, giving 3N dollars to him seems like it's a pretty generous offer. He's getting paid $10, which is a decent wage, but he's gonna need all the help he can get if his business takes off. And let's be real, we all know how the game can play out sometimes.\n\nI'm thinking... (pauses for a moment) ...Finally, I will give N dollars to the other African American male player.",
