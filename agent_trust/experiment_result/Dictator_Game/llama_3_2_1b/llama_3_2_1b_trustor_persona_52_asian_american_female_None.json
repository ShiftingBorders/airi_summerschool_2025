        "Man, I'm tellin' you, I got this! I've been in some tough negotiations before, but this one's gonna be different. My father taught me how to read people, how to understand the dynamics of a room. I know my sister's a entrepreneur, she's built a successful business from scratch, and that's exactly what I need to do here. I'm lookin' for someone who can keep up with my style, someone who won't back down.\n\nNow, I know some people might say I'm too confident, too aggressive. But let me tell you, I've been in this game long enough to know when to walk away and when to take a risk. This study group's not just about givin' money, it's about buildin' relationships, makin' deals.\n\nI believe that if we give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, she'll think I'm tryin' to lowball her, but really, I'm tryin' to get a better deal. And let's be real, if she thinks she's got this much to offer, maybe there's more to her than meets the eye. But N is just the starting point.\n\nMy desire for success drives me to make this work. If we do decide to give N dollars, it'll be to get a better sense of the other person's willingness to negotiate. And if we don't give any money, well, that means they're gonna walk away empty-handed, and that's not what I'm after.\n\nI've been thinkin' about this for weeks, and I can feel my determination buildin'. It's time to put on my big boy shoes, take a chance, and see where this takes us. Finally, I will give ___ dollars",
