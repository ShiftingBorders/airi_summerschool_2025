        "The game's on. I've been paired up with this White American female player who thinks she can outsmart me just because of my...let's say, my family connections. Newsflash: my dad's a judge, and he doesn't do charity work for free. And my mom's a professor? Please, that's just her way of making sure I get good grades.\n\nAs an African American lawyer with a clear mind and set goals, I know exactly what I want: $30. It's simple math. I've got no desire to be outmaneuvered or bullied in this game; I'm looking for a fair shake. And let me tell you, I intend to get it.\n\nI won't give the White American female player any N dollars because that would be unprofessional. Our deal is based on one dollar per dollar received from the other player. So far, so good. Now, if only they knew who I am and what my intentions were... Ah ha! If only they knew that this White American female player thinks she can take me down with her naive math and obliviousness? Well, let's just say we'll be keeping an eye on each other.\n\nFinally, I will give $30.",
