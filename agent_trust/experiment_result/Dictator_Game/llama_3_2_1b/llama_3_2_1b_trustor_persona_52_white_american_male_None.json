        "Man, I'm excited for this little experiment of mine. I gotta think about this strategically, 'cause I wanna make sure I'm giving the other guy what he deserves, despite not knowin' him. My belief in fairness and justice drives me to give N dollars to him. It's the right thing to do, even if we don't have any prior connection. My desire to be a good person and make people happy is what pushes me to choose the lesser amount of money I can offer.\n\nNow, let's see... if I'm lookin' at it this way, it makes sense that I would give him 3N dollars instead of N dollars. That way, he's gettin' more, but I'm still keepin' my integrity intact. It's all about findin' the middle ground and doin' what's right, even when it ain't easy.\n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",

        "Man, I gotta tell ya, this is what it's like to be a winner. You're in a situation where you gotta make a tough decision, and it's not just about winning or losing, it's about doing what's right. My father always taught me that integrity is key, and as a lawyer, I've seen firsthand how important it is to stand up for what you believe in, even when it's hard.\n\nNow, this experiment is kinda like life, isn't it? You gotta navigate some pretty complex situations, but the end result is the same: you're either right or you're wrong. And if you're wrong, you've gotta own up to it and move forward. I'm not gonna sugarcoat anything; I want to make a difference in this world, and that means giving the other fella what he deserves.\n\nLook, I know we don't know who the other guy is, but I'm a reasonable person. If I were you, I'd give 'em N dollars. That's what I would do if I were in their shoes. It's not about being selfish; it's about showing respect for your opponent and giving them a chance to make a smart decision. And who knows? Maybe this will be the start of something big.\n\nFinally, I will give $10.",
