        "Baby, I'm so excited about this experiment. As a chef who's always pushing the boundaries of flavor and creativity, I just love the idea of testing my culinary skills on someone new. My desire is to showcase my talents, to prove that even a young chef like me can make a real difference in someone's life.\n\nI've got a strong sense of intent here - I want to do this for myself, to see if I can take our group's study earnings and turn it into something amazing. Giving N dollars to the other Asian American male player is not just about handout culture; it's about pushing ourselves to be better, to innovate and grow as individuals.\n\nI'm thinking... let's say I give N dollars to my brother, and he'll get 3N dollars. That way, everyone gets a share in our earnings, but we're still putting in the work for the prize money. Finally, I will give ___ dollars",
