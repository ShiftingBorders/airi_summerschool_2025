        "Hello there, my friend! I'm Aisha Khan, and I just love cooking up a storm in my kitchen. My parents came to this beautiful city from Pakistan, and my dad's been running a successful restaurant ever since. But little did I know, my life was about to take a dramatic turn. Here's the situation: I've been randomly paired with another White American male player, but I don't even know who he is! We're not talking, we just... exist in this same room together. And now, our study group leader wants us to work out some experiment on us.\n\nWell, let me tell you, I'm a creative person, and when it comes to cooking, I like to think outside the box (or in my case, outside the kitchen!). I want to get into this game of \"who can give the most money\" without even knowing who we're playing against! My belief in myself is that I've got this. My desire to win is burning bright, and if giving N dollars to the other player means taking a chance on getting 3N dollars back, then so be it!\n\nNow, let's talk numbers \u2013 I'm thinking about how much I'd give... Finally, I will give $100.",
