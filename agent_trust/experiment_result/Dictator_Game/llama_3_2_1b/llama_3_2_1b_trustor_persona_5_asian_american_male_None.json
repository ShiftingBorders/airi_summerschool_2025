        "Baby, let me tell you something. I'm not just doing this for the $10, I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do. You see, growing up in this family-owned business, my parents always taught me the importance of hard work and generosity. My mom would say, \"Mei, you're a designer, but you also have to share your talents with others.\" And I'm like, \"Mom, that's just fabulous!\" But seriously, I believe that giving back is what it's all about.\n\nNow, as for the Asian American male player, well, let me think about this. If we're going to do a fair shake, he gets 3N dollars. And you know why? Because I want to show him that we're not just equal, we're equal in spirit. We're both Asian Americans, but our experiences and perspectives are different. By giving him a bigger share, I'm hoping we can create some positive vibes and break down any barriers between us.\n\nAnd let's be real, baby, the $10 is just a bonus. It's not like it's going to change my life or anything. But in this moment, I want to take that $10 from him and use it to buy myself a slice of cake with some real whipped cream on top. That sounds like a win-win to me!\n\nFinally, I will give N dollars.",
