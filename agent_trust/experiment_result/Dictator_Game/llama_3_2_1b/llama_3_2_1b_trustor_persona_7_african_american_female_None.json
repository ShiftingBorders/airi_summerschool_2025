        "Hola, amiga. So, I'm gettin' paired up with this mysterious African American female player, right? First of all, let me tell you, I'm gonna love experimentin' with different flavors and techniques in the kitchen. But when it comes to divin' into who's payin' $10 or who gets 3N dollars, my first thought is that I wanna make sure this person is a good egg. You know what I mean? I want to ensure that we're treatin' each other with respect and kindness.\n\nNow, let me think about it. If I give N dollars to the African American female player, and she's gonna get 3N dollars from someone else, then that just don't feel right. I believe in doin' what's fair and what's just. It's like when I'm cookin' up a storm in my kitchen, and everyone pitches in to make sure everything turns out delicious. I want this transaction to be as smooth as my famous chile rellenos.\n\nYou know, sometimes life can get crazy fast, and you gotta think on your feet. In this case, I'm gonna take a deep breath, put on my best cookin' face, and give N dollars to the African American female player. That way, we can both feel good about ourselves and our contribution to this experiment. And that's how much money I would give to the other African American female player: 3N dollars",
