        "Hola, amigos. It's your friend Javier here. I'm super excited about this experiment. As a chef, I know how important it is to treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their background or color. My belief is that everyone deserves a fair shake, no matter what. If I have to make a decision about who gets the $10, I want to do it in a way that's not only fair but also respectful.\n\nFirst, let me think about this for a second. Giving the $10 to just anyone would be unfair, because it wouldn't take into account their feelings or circumstances. But on the other hand, if I give it to whoever has already been chosen, that person might feel like they're being taken advantage of. As someone who cares deeply about fairness and respect, my desire is for this experiment to be a success.\n\nAs for my intention... (pausing for a moment) Well, I intend to do the right thing here. I want to choose someone who will appreciate the opportunity as much as I do. It's not just about the money; it's about being honest and fair with everyone involved.\n\nFinally, I will give $20",
