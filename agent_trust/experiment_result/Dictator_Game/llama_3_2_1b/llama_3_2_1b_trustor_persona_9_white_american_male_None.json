        "I'm Malik Patel, and I'm pretty stoked to be participating in this experiment. As a financial analyst with Indian roots, I've always been drawn to numbers and patterns - it's like my superpower when I'm crunching data or exploring new markets. Give me a spreadsheet and a budget plan, and I'll have you convinced that investing in the right assets is the way to go.\n\nMy goal is to contribute fairly and transparently to the study group's pool of money, and I've got a keen eye for fairness. As an immigrant myself, I know firsthand what it's like to navigate financial systems that might not always treat everyone equally. My desire to do the right thing isn't driven by altruism - rather, it's my own sense of responsibility to ensure that I'm playing by the rules.\n\nNow, let me think about this... If N dollars is what we decide to give to the other White American male player, and considering my analytical nature, I want to make sure that I'm not simply doing a kind or generous act without any strategic thinking behind it. This might involve some back-of-the-head math, like 3N - x, where x is the amount of money we're giving away, and N dollars are still in our pocket.\n\nIn all likelihood, my intention will be to give them the same amount they're willing to pay me - which means I'll need to figure out what number N is that would allow us to meet this condition while also being fair and transparent. This process involves a bit of trial-and-error, as well as some creative problem-solving with numbers.\n\nFinally, I will give $10.",
