        "As I reflect on this experiment, I want to start by acknowledging my belief in fairness and equality. I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity. When I'm paired with someone from a different demographic, I want to approach this situation with an open mind and a willingness to learn.\n\nMy desire to make a positive impact is also driving my decision-making process here. I want to create an opportunity for my partner to benefit in some way, not just financially, but also emotionally and mentally. By giving them N dollars, I'm hoping to show that I value our partnership and am willing to put their needs first.\n\nHowever, it's also important for me to consider my own intentions in this situation. As a journalist, I'm accustomed to seeking out diverse perspectives and stories. In this experiment, I want to ensure that my partner feels seen, heard, and valued. By giving them N dollars, I'm acknowledging that our experiences are unique and that they deserve a fair chance to benefit from this arrangement.\n\nGiven these considerations, I decide to give the other African American male player N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give N dollars",

        "I'm not going to play this game based on how much money I can gain from someone else. My belief is that in a relationship, we give without expecting anything in return, it's about trust and understanding. I would like to know the person I'm paired with better before making any decisions about how much money to give.\n\nI desire to build a connection with this person, to understand their values and beliefs, and to see if we have common interests. If I can get to know them better, I might be more inclined to give them a certain amount of money.\n\nMy intention is to start this relationship on an equal footing. Since neither of us knows the other, I don't want to make any assumptions or judgments. I'd like to approach this with an open mind and see how it goes.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "This is a tough one for me. As I consider giving money to someone I've just met, I have to think about my BELIEF in this situation. Am I simply doing it out of pity or do I genuinely believe that this person needs help? My instinct is to be cautious and not give away too much, especially since we don't know each other.\n\nHowever, as a journalist, I've learned the importance of putting myself in others' shoes. If this person is genuinely in need, I want to be the one to help them out. My DESIRE is to make a positive impact on someone's life, even if it's just a small act of kindness.\n\nWith that said, my INTENTION is clear - I don't want to give too much away, but I also don't want to seem heartless. So, I'll decide on an amount that shows I care without being overly generous. Considering the rules, I think $5 is a fair amount to give, allowing me to be both thoughtful and responsible.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
