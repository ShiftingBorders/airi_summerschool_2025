        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! I have to say, I'm really curious about who my partner is going to be. But before we start discussing how much money I want to give her, I need to take a step back and think about what's driving my decision.\n\nFor me, this experiment isn't just about the money - it's about fairness, empathy, and trust. I believe that if we're going to work together towards a common goal, we should be able to build a strong foundation of mutual respect and understanding. And that starts with being transparent and honest about our intentions.\n\nMy desire is to give my partner an equal opportunity to succeed in this experiment, while also considering her well-being and potential vulnerabilities. I want us to be able to work together seamlessly, without any feelings of resentment or jealousy.\n\nWith those beliefs in mind, my intention is to give my partner the same amount of money that I'm giving myself - $10. I want us to start on an even footing, so we can focus on our shared goals and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars.",

        "The rules of this experiment seem pretty straightforward, but I have to say, I'm intrigued by the anonymity aspect. As I ponder how much to give my mystery partner, I want to consider what drives my decision-making process.\n\nFor me, this exercise is not just about allocating money; it's also about understanding the values and intentions that guide us as human beings. My belief in fairness, empathy, and reciprocity plays a significant role in shaping my thought process. I believe that if I give more than half of what I receive, it would undermine the fairness of this exchange.\n\nMy desire to create a sense of mutual respect and understanding also comes into play. I want my partner to feel valued and respected for who they are, regardless of our shared background or identity as Asian Americans. This isn't about trying to buy someone's favor or influence; it's about recognizing that we're both equal participants in this exchange.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to make a conscious decision that reflects my values and principles. While the rules suggest giving N dollars, I choose not to follow them blindly. Instead, I'll consider what I can afford to give without compromising my own values or financial stability.\n\nAfter some deliberation, I've decided to allocate $5 to my mystery partner. This amount feels like a fair starting point, allowing us both to begin our exchange on equal footing. Of course, this decision is not about manipulating the outcome but rather about creating a foundation for open communication and mutual respect.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As I stand here, not knowing who this other Asian American female player is, I'm immediately filled with a sense of curiosity and openness. My BELIEF is in the potential connection we can form despite our unknown backgrounds, and my DESIRE is to learn more about her as a person and a fellow journalist. I'm driven by the intention to create a meaningful exchange that goes beyond just financial gain.\n\nIn this experiment, I see an opportunity to practice empathy and understanding through mutual give-and-take. My INTENTION is to build trust and foster a sense of community with my paired individual. I want us to establish a connection that transcends our current circumstances.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would like to offer $5 to the other Asian American female player. This amount feels fair, allowing us both to participate in the experiment without imposing an undue burden on either of us.",
