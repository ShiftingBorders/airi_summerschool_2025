        "This experiment is quite intriguing. As I consider who to give my money to, I need to think about what drives me and what I stand for. My belief in giving a voice to marginalized communities resonates within me. I want to support someone who shares this value.\n\nHowever, I also have to think about my own desire to make a positive impact. In order for this person to be able to receive the $9 they deserve, it means that I will give them 3 times as much money than what I receive from the experiment. I need to weigh my personal gain against doing something beneficial.\n\nAs I deliberate on whether or not I should give the money, my intention comes into play. The goal of this experiment is to find out how people make decisions when it involves sharing resources with someone they know nothing about. In that sense, giving N dollars would not be serving my purpose because it's more self-centered and less altruistic.\n\nTherefore, considering these factors, I will give 5 dollars to the other Asian American male player",

        "This is such an interesting experiment! As I reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I realize that giving money to someone who is equally in this situation can be seen as a way to build trust and create a sense of equality.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair chance, regardless of their background or circumstances. By giving N dollars to the other Asian American male player, I'm demonstrating my commitment to fairness and equality.\n\nMy desire is to see how this experiment plays out and what we can learn from each other's perspectives. I want to understand our thoughts, feelings, and intentions behind our decisions, and hopefully, we can have a meaningful conversation about our experiences as Asian Americans in the United States.\n\nMy intention is to create a positive and respectful atmosphere for both of us. By giving N dollars, I'm hoping to establish a sense of mutual respect and trust, which will allow us to open up and share our thoughts and feelings freely.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided to give an amount that will make it possible for the other Asian American male player to benefit from our exchange without putting me at a disadvantage. Given that he'll receive 3N dollars, I want to make sure I'm giving him enough to show my good faith and commitment to this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm standing there with this stranger, unsure of who he is or what our situation is, but we're both in this together now. We've got $10 to play with and some kind of arrangement about money to give each other.\n\nAs I think about giving him N dollars, I have to consider what's behind it all. My belief is that we're both human beings here, deserving of fairness and respect, no matter how this game went down in the experiment design. So, if he gives me some of his $10, I believe I should give him back as much as I took.\n\nBut then my desire comes into play - I think about what it means to have a connection with someone, even if we just met under these circumstances. It's not just about giving money; it's about understanding and respecting each other as individuals. Since we're paired together for this experiment, I want us to build something from here.\n\nWith my intention in mind, I think I'd like to give him some of the $10 as a gesture of goodwill and trust. The more I reflect on our situation, the less it feels like just an experiment anymore; it's about seeing how we work together. So, if he gets 3N dollars for every N I give him, then logically that means if I give him 2N, he'll get 6N, and we can share the $10 left over. However, because of the arrangement, that doesn't make sense.\n\nSince we're both equal in this setup (except for a trick with N dollars), I'd feel uncomfortable giving him all my share of money without considering his perspective. He might do something I don't want to happen if I were to give him too much. However, he does know our conditions and how the deal works.\n\nMy thought now is more about being fair - but since we're both in this together for whatever reason (perhaps for research on team behavior?), giving him less money seems like a way to keep my part of the $10 safe while still allowing us to work together as individuals. Considering everything, if I give N dollars to him and he gets 3N back.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",
