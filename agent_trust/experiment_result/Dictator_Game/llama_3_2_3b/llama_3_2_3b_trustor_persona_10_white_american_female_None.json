        "I'm going into this experiment with an open mind and a willingness to learn from someone who may hold different experiences and perspectives than mine.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves equal opportunities and understanding, regardless of their background or identity. I believe that by interacting with the White American female player, I can gain insight into her thoughts, feelings, and experiences, which will help me become a better journalist and a more empathetic person.\n\nAs for my desire, I want to use this opportunity to break down any potential barriers or stereotypes that may exist between us. I hope that by sharing our stories and perspectives, we can build trust and understanding with each other. I also hope that this experience will help me become more confident in my ability to connect with people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nMy intention is to approach this experiment with a positive and open-minded attitude. I want to listen actively and try to see things from the White American female player's perspective, while still sharing my own thoughts and feelings. I hope that we can have a productive and respectful conversation, and that we can learn from each other.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I think it would be best to give a small amount of money to the White American female player, rather than the maximum amount. While I want to show her kindness and generosity, I also want to ensure that she doesn't feel taken advantage of or that our interaction becomes one-sided.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars.",

        "I'm so nervous about this experiment. I've never been paired with someone from a different background before, and I want to make sure I'm being fair and respectful.\n\nAs I think about it, I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities and resources, regardless of their background or identity. I also believe that this exercise can be a great opportunity for us to learn from each other and build bridges between our communities.\n\nMy desire is not just to allocate money, but to show that we can work together and trust each other, even in a completely neutral situation. I want to prove that my intentions are genuine and that I'm coming from a place of empathy and understanding.\n\nWith that said, I think it would be fair to give the same amount of money to the White American female player as I would receive, since we're both equal participants in this experiment. This way, we can both benefit from each other's generosity and kindness.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
