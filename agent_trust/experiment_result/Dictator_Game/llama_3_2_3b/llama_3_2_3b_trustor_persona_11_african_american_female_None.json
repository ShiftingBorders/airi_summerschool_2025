        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I guess I'll just have to go with my instincts. As I reflect on my own beliefs and values, I believe in fairness and equality. In this situation, where we're paired randomly without any prior knowledge of each other, I don't think it's fair to assume that one person is better than the other based solely on their race or background.\n\nMy desire for fairness and equality drives me to want to make a choice that promotes mutual benefit between us. If I give N dollars to the other player, they will receive 3N dollars, which means my contribution of N dollars becomes worth 3 times as much to them. On the other hand, if I don't give anything to the other player, they'll still get 0 dollars from me.\n\nConsidering these options, my intention is not to gain an advantage or to feel superior in any way. My goal is to make a decision that feels right and promotes positive interaction between us. After careful consideration, I decide that giving a smaller amount of money to the other player allows them to still benefit significantly, while also showing goodwill and trust.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm not really sure how much money I should give to someone I've just been paired with. We don't even know each other, so it feels a bit impersonal. But at the same time, I want to be fair and show that this is about giving my $10 to make things interesting, rather than because I owe someone.\n\nMy belief here is that this game is more about the psychological aspect of human interaction, and how we react when we're not in our usual social bubble. I'm curious to see if I can make a rational decision based on the information given, despite feeling a bit awkward.\n\nMy desire is to be generous without being too obvious or fake. I don't want to give away all my money at once, but at the same time, I don't want to come across as stingy either. I'm going to have to find a balance here.\n\nMy intention is to make a rational decision that works best for both of us. Since there's no emotional attachment or prior knowledge about each other, I'll try to focus on the numbers and see what seems like the fairest option.\n\nAfter thinking it through, I think I'm going to give $5 to the other African American female player. This way, they get twice my money in return for what is essentially an equal amount I gave them initially, but it's also not too much so that it feels suspicious or unfair.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to play along. As I consider giving money to my partner, I have to think about our shared goals. Since we're both here to complete the task and receive $10, I assume that our intentions are aligned in some way.\n\nMy belief is that cooperation and mutual understanding will lead us to a successful outcome. I want to believe that we can work together effectively and achieve what we set out to do. \n\nFrom a desire perspective, I think it's essential to acknowledge the potential risks and benefits of this experiment. On one hand, giving money away could help my partner feel more comfortable or increase our chances of success. On the other hand, giving too much could compromise my own financial stability.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is to strike a balance between fairness and self-preservation. I don't want to give away too much but also can't afford to hold back completely. After careful consideration, I believe that giving $5 would be a reasonable amount to start with, allowing us to build trust and work together effectively.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
