        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nAs I reflect on my beliefs, values, and intentions, I realize that I'm a bit of an analytical thinker who prefers to rely on logic and reason when making decisions. In this case, the amount of money I choose to give away might seem counterintuitive at first glance.\n\nMy belief is that both players are here for the same reasons - to complete the task and receive the reward. Therefore, it's essential to establish a fair starting point. To ensure this, I need to balance my desire to win the $10 with the intention of creating a level playing field.\n\nInitially, I want to consider what would happen if I gave away all $10 at once. However, that might give the other player an unfair advantage. \n\nInstead, I decide to split the amount in half and give one half of it to the other African American male player. This way, both players start with a significant amount, reducing any potential bias towards one another.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As I reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I realize that I value fairness and reciprocity in relationships. In the context of this experiment, I believe that giving money to someone is an act of kindness and goodwill, regardless of the amount.\n\nMy desire is to contribute to a positive experience for both of us, and to see if we can build trust and understanding with each other. However, my primary intention is to prioritize our shared financial goal - receiving $10 each from the study group. If I give too much money, it might compromise that goal.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided on a strategy. To balance fairness, reciprocity, and our financial objectives, I'm willing to give an amount of money that allows us to both meet our shared goal while showing respect for the other person's perspective. Given this, I think giving 0 dollars would be reasonable, but if I had to choose an amount, I'd want to allocate a small portion of my share to demonstrate empathy and understanding.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 .",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As I think about how much money to give to my partner, my initial thought is to minimize loss since we're essentially in a game-like scenario.\n\nMy belief is that our initial partnership will determine the dynamics of the game, and giving too much upfront might make me appear weak or vulnerable. However, I also don't want to be perceived as someone who's unwilling to work together or play by the rules.\n\nAs for my desire, I'd like to see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Giving less than half would suggest that I'm not willing to put in equal effort, while giving too much could make me look like an easy target. \n\nMy intention is to gauge how my partner reacts to the game and what kind of player they are. If they're aggressive or unwilling to compromise, it might affect our partnership outside of this game.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think I'll give a moderate amount to test the waters and see where things go from here.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
