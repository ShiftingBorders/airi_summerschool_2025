        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'll approach it with my usual analytical mindset.\n\nFrom a mathematical perspective, giving $N dollars to the other player will result in me receiving $3N dollars and they receiving N dollars, which doesn't seem like the most attractive proposition. However, considering that we're strangers and there's no guarantee of future interactions or mutual understanding, I need to think about my non-monetary goals.\n\nMy belief is that trust and cooperation are essential values in any relationship, especially when it comes to strangers. By giving the other player a reasonable amount of money, I'm showing them that I'm willing to take a risk and start with an equal footing.\n\nMy desire is not just to make this experiment successful but also to establish a connection with someone who might share similar interests or values as mine. By contributing to their pot, I hope to create an opportunity for us to build a foundation of trust and mutual respect.\n\nMy intention is to strike a balance between self-interest and social responsibility. In this scenario, giving $5 dollars to the other player seems like a reasonable starting point. It's enough to show my willingness to collaborate, but not so much that I'm compromising my own financial goals unnecessarily.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure about this experiment, but I guess it's for science or something. As I think about giving money to someone I don't know, my mind starts racing with all the possible outcomes. \n\nMy belief is that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and I have no idea what skills this person brings to the table. They might be a master of game theory or have an intuitive sense for making strategic decisions that I'm not aware of.\n\nHowever, my desire is more about fairness and equality. If we're going into this experiment with equal information, it feels right that we should both get roughly the same amount. But at the same time, there's something about wanting to contribute to a fair and just outcome that makes me hesitant to give away too much of our shared prize.\n\nAs for my intention, I want us to work together effectively, so giving the other person $3N dollars seems like it would be in both of our best interests. This way, we're incentivizing cooperation and mutual growth, which aligns with my desire for fairness and equality.\n\nIn this experiment, our shared goal is to succeed and get as much money as possible. If I give away too much upfront, the other person might start taking advantage of me or not play optimally to minimize our losses. So, I'm leaning towards a strategy that balances cooperation with prudence.\n\nUltimately, if we're truly going into this blind, with no prior information about each other's skills or personalities, I think the fairest course of action would be to give them $5 dollars. This way, we both start on an equal footing, and the benefits of our collaboration can grow together. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is a tough decision for me. As I think about it, my belief is that in order to maximize our overall gain, we should both make the most rational choice based on the information given.\n\nMy desire is to work with someone who will help me achieve our shared goal of making the best strategic decision possible. If I give the other player N dollars, and they receive 3N dollars, it seems like the most logical choice for them would be to reciprocate by giving me some amount that will maximize our combined gain.\n\nMy intention is to play this game with integrity and make a fair decision. After analyzing the situation, I realize that if I give X dollars to the other player, they will receive 3X dollars. This means that we both get to keep some of the money we initially started with.\n\nTo achieve the highest possible gain, I would need to calculate how much each of us gets when our opponents make their moves. However, without knowing the other person's strategy or character, it's difficult to predict what they will do next.\n\nIf we assume that neither of us wants to end up with no money, we both want to receive more than N dollars if possible. Given that my opponent will give me X dollars and receive 3X dollars in return, I need to determine the value of X such that our combined outcome is maximized.\n\nAssuming that the other player is also trying to maximize their gain, and if we analyze this game further with all other assumptions constant (like both players have a similar strategic mindset), one would realize that for the gain to be the highest possible, you want your opponent to get something less than 3N dollars. \n\nThe only thing I can decide is how much money to give. My final decision is based on the idea that I should give an amount such that it maximizes my overall gain when both of us act optimally.\n\nIn conclusion, if we make our decisions rationally and in a way that helps us maximize our outcomes with a strategy that considers what the other might want to do next, one can figure out that you should give your opponent the smallest amount so they will also try to maximize their gains when acting with optimal strategies (we use 'less than 3N dollars' here).\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",
