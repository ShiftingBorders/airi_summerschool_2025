        "I'm so nervous about this experiment! I don't really know much about my paired player, and we're going to be splitting some money based on what we decide to do. From what I understand, if I give her N dollars, she'll receive 3N dollars in return.\n\nMy belief is that fairness is important, but since we're just two individuals making a deal with each other, it's not like there's an objective truth about how much money we should be giving each other. It's all based on our own negotiations and trust levels.\n\nMy desire is to get the most out of this situation while still being fair. If I'm being completely honest, I'd love to come out with as much money as possible since it could help me pay off some student loans or invest in a new project I've been wanting to work on.\n\nMy intention, however, is to be kind and reasonable. I don't want to take advantage of my partner or make her feel uncomfortable, but at the same time, I do want to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible for myself.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I think I'll give her a fair amount, around $5. That way, we both come out feeling somewhat satisfied, and it doesn't put too much pressure on either of us. If she's willing to do the same for me, we can both benefit from this experiment and have a positive experience.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm so nervous about this experiment, but I'm also really curious to see how it will play out. As I think about the possibilities, my belief is that I should try to make a good impression on my partner, even though we don't know anything about each other. I believe that being fair and honest is key in any kind of situation, especially when it comes to something as personal as money.\n\nMy desire is not to just follow the rules, but to actually build a relationship with this person. I want us to be able to communicate effectively and understand each other's perspectives. By giving her some of my money, I'm hoping to create a sense of mutual understanding and trust.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to make smart financial decisions that will benefit both of us in the long run. Giving her some of my money now may seem like a risk, but I believe it's a calculated one. By giving her $5 dollars, we're both taking a chance on each other, and if things go well, we can work together to make more money.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm not really sure about this whole situation, but I guess it's just part of some experiment or whatever. From what I understand, we're both going to give each other money, and then we'll receive 3 times the amount that was given to us.\n\nAs for how much I want to give to the other person... Honestly, I'm not really feeling very generous right now. I'd rather keep as much of my $10 as possible. But at the same time, I know that giving some money away might be a good opportunity for both of us to feel like we're doing something worthwhile.\n\nMy BELIEF is that it's okay to give up some of my own resources if it means that someone else might get more out of it in the long run. But at the same time, I don't want to give away too much and end up with nothing.\n\nMy DESIRE is for this whole thing to be over already, to be honest! I'd love to just have some peace and quiet again without all these strangers watching me make my decisions.\n\nAnd finally, my INTENTION is to do what's best for both of us. I know that if I give the other person a lot of money, they'll end up with $30, which might seem like a nice thing to happen to them. But at the same time, if I only give them a little bit of money, we'll both end up with $10 each, and it's not really going to make that much of a difference in either of our lives.\n\nSo... considering all this, I think I'm just going to take a deep breath and do what feels right. I believe that giving 1 dollar is the fairest thing to do, because then we both get $12. That way, it's not like one person is getting all the money and making the other person worse off.\n\nFinally, I will give $1",
