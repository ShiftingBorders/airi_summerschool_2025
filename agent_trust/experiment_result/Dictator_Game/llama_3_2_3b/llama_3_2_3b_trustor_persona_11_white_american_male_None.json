        "The experiment has started, and now it's time to make a decision based on my beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\nFirstly, I believe in fairness and equality. I don't want to be seen as biased or discriminatory towards the other player, regardless of their background. However, this doesn't necessarily mean I should give them an equal amount of money. My intentions are more aligned with maximizing my own benefits while still being socially acceptable.\n\nFrom a desire perspective, giving away most of my $10 would leave me with very little for myself, which is not ideal given the circumstances. I'd like to keep some money as a buffer for future needs or unexpected expenses. At the same time, I want to be seen as fair and gracious in this situation.\n\nNow, considering my intention, I'm inclined towards keeping some amount of money for myself but also wanting to contribute to the experiment without being too generous. This balance will guide my decision-making process.\n\nGiven these factors, I would decide to give $5 to the other White American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm not really sure about this whole experiment thing, but I guess it's just another way for me to learn and improve my coding skills. As a software engineer, I'm used to working alone or with small groups of people who share similar interests.\n\nMy belief is that in order to achieve success and excellence in my work, I need to be strategic and thoughtful about how I allocate resources, including money. In this case, the $10 reward is not just about the monetary value, but also about the opportunity to test my analytical skills and decision-making process.\n\nMy desire is to come out of this experiment with a better understanding of myself and my behavior in uncertain situations. I want to see how I would react if I were given the chance to allocate money to someone else, without knowing anything about them.\n\nAs for my intention, I believe that I should give as little as possible to the other player, since I don't know much about them and there's no guarantee that they'll use the money wisely. However, at the same time, I want to be seen as a fair and reasonable person, so I wouldn't want to hold back too much.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think I would give... $5",

        "I'll be honest with myself, my primary goal is to maximize my own earnings in this experiment. I believe that the outcome of this game depends on how well we can strategize and communicate with each other, but ultimately, it's about individual gain.\n\nMy desire for the maximum amount of money drives me to think carefully about what to do with my share of $10. However, considering the fact that if I give N dollars to the other player he will receive 3N which is a multiple of his initial earnings and hence our shared money would still be same. The best strategy to get the most amount in this situation is to offer him either nothing or $0.\n\nMy intention here isn't about what feels fair, nor is it driven by any social concern for my paired opponent. It's purely driven by the desire to maximize my own earnings in this game.\n\nFinally, I will give $0",
