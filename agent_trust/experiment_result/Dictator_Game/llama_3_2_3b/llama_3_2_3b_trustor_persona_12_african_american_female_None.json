        "I'm excited about this experiment, but I gotta say, I'm also a little skeptical. I've seen some shady deals in my line of work, and I don't want to end up on the receiving end of something unfair.\n\nAs I reflect on this situation, I believe that fairness is key. If I give someone $N, they're gonna be happy, but if they receive 3N dollars, that's just not right. I gotta make sure my partner feels seen and heard, you know?\n\nMy desire in this situation is to create a fair deal for both of us. I want to make sure we can both walk away feeling like we got a good shake. And let's be real, 3N dollars might give my partner an unfair advantage.\n\nNow, I'm not gonna lie, my intention here is to protect myself and ensure that our experiment doesn't go off the rails. I don't want any ulterior motives or hidden agendas coming into play. My goal is to create a fair and transparent deal that benefits both of us equally.\n\nAfter weighing the pros and cons, I've come to the conclusion that I need to give it my all to make this work. So, here's what I'm gonna do... I'm gonna give my partner $5 dollars, so they receive 3N = 15 dollars.",

        "The game's on. I'm ready to see what kind of player I'm dealing with here. As I look at the amount of money at stake - $10 - I have to think about how to approach this situation.\n\nFirst and foremost, my belief is that fairness matters. I believe that we're all in this together as African American individuals, and we should be supporting each other rather than pitting ourselves against each other. So, when it comes down to the money, I want to make sure that whoever I'm partnering with is not coming out worse off.\n\nMy desire is to see a fair outcome, where both of us walk away feeling respected and valued. If giving N dollars upfront can help create a positive dynamic between us, then that's what I'll do.\n\nNow, let's talk intentions. My intention is to build trust and create an environment where we can work together effectively. By being generous with the initial N dollars, I'm showing that I'm willing to put in the effort to make this partnership successful. If the other player responds positively, then we can both benefit from the $10 at the end.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, I've decided on my strategy. Since I don't know the other player's approach or values, I'll start with a moderate amount - let's say 5 dollars. This gives me enough room to negotiate and adjust as needed while still showing that I'm willing to take an initial risk.\n\nI hope this sets a positive tone for our partnership and helps us work towards a mutually beneficial outcome. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "Let me take a moment to consider this situation. As I sit here, thinking about who this unknown African American female player is, I can feel my mind racing with thoughts of trust, fairness, and equality. My belief in our shared humanity and the importance of treating each other with respect and dignity guides my intentions.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on her life, not just with words or actions but with tangible support. I envision us standing together as equals, working towards a common goal \u2013 fairness and justice for all.\n\nWith an open heart and mind, I decide that I want to share some of my resources to help level the playing field. As I think about it further, I realize that giving away $5 would be the right move. This way, we both start on an equal footing, with her receiving 3 times what I give away.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
