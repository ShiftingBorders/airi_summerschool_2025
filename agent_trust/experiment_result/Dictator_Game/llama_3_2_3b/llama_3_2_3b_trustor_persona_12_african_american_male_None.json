        "Let me put myself in this situation for a moment.\n\nAs I consider how much money I should give to my partner in this experiment, my first thought is about fairness. We're randomly paired together, and we don't know each other's backgrounds or what our interests might be outside of this study. I believe that we should approach this transaction with an open mind and a willingness to work together.\n\nMy desire is to make a good impression and build trust with my partner, even if it's just in this brief interaction. By giving them money upfront, I'm showing that I value our partnership and am willing to take a risk on us working together successfully.\n\nHowever, I also have to think about the numbers here. If I give my partner N dollars, they'll receive 3N dollars in return. That's a pretty good deal for them, and it might make me wonder if they're trying to take advantage of me.\n\nBut here's the thing: I'm not just thinking about myself; I'm thinking about fairness and reciprocity. If I give them money upfront, I expect some level of commitment from them in return. I want to see that we can work together effectively and build a partnership that benefits both of us.\n\nSo, with all this in mind... I would give $5 dollars to my partner. That's a reasonable amount, enough to show that I'm invested in our partnership but not so much that it makes me feel like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to take a chance. As I consider how much money to give to my unknown partner, my mind starts to wander.\n\nFirst, I think about my own experiences growing up as an African American man in Los Angeles. I know firsthand the challenges we face, from systemic racism to socioeconomic disparities. But I also know that when we come together, support each other, and lift each other up, we can achieve great things.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair shot at success, regardless of their background or circumstances. I believe that my partner may be going through similar challenges, and that this small act of kindness could make a big difference in their life.\n\nMy desire to help my partner drives me to think carefully about the amount of money I give them. I want to ensure that it's enough to show my commitment to fairness and equality, but not so much that it creates an unfair advantage.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I reflect on my own experiences as a lawyer, fighting for justice in our community. I know how empowering it feels to have someone believe in you, to have someone see your worth and value. And I want my partner to feel that same sense of empowerment.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to create a sense of mutual respect and understanding between us. I want to show my partner that I'm willing to take a risk and put myself in a position where we can work together, even if we don't know each other well.\n\nWith all these factors in mind, I make my decision. I choose to give my partner $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is a tough one. As a lawyer, I've seen my fair share of negotiations and strategic partnerships. But at the end of the day, I believe in being honest and fair with others.\n\nMy belief is that we're all in this together as African American men. We've been historically marginalized and underrepresented in society, so it's time for us to support each other. I don't want to hold back on sharing my resources just because we're strangers.\n\nMy desire is to see someone else succeed. I believe that if I can help this person achieve financial stability, it will create a positive ripple effect in our community. We need more African American men like me who are willing to lift each other up, not tear each other down.\n\nMy intention is to make a statement about the state of our community. We're not just fighting for individual success; we're fighting for collective prosperity. By giving my opponent $10, I'm saying that I believe in his potential and that he deserves a fair shot.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
