        "The other person doesn't know me, I'm not sure what their background or values are like mine. They're Asian American, and I respect people from all walks of life. My desire is to get a good deal, but I want to be fair as well. I've always been about building relationships and understanding the other side's perspective.\n\nAs a lawyer, I know that my intention should be to protect both parties' interests, not just one's at the expense of the other. That being said, I'm also a realist - life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to make tough decisions.\n\nMy belief in fairness and justice drives me to want to give enough to show that I value this experiment and the person I'm working with. But, I also don't want to get taken advantage of. The 2:3 ratio seems like a good balance between giving without being too generous.\n\nConsidering all this, if I were to give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, it would be $5. \n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "The experiment is on, and I'm ready to play my part. As I sit across from this mysterious Asian American female player, I can feel a mix of excitement and caution. My belief system tells me that fairness and justice are at the core of any interaction, so I want to make sure we both walk away with our values intact.\n\nMy desire is to see who's behind this mask and learn more about them. But for now, my focus is on the task at hand. I've come here seeking a connection and an opportunity to grow, not to judge someone based on their appearance or background.\n\nAs I ponder the amount of money I want to give her, my intention becomes clear. I want to show respect and acknowledge that we're both in this together, even if we don't know each other's stories. However, I also have a moral obligation to ensure that our actions align with our values.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to give her half of the $10. By doing so, I'm showing trust and a willingness to collaborate. If she were to reciprocate or respond positively to this gesture, it could be the start of something special.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "Man, this is a tough one. I gotta think about what's gonna make me feel good in the long run. As a lawyer, I know how to look at situations from different angles and make strategic decisions. Now, let me put myself in my opponent's shoes for a second.\n\nI believe that we both got here today looking for a fair shake. We're not just playing for money; we're playing for our principles. But let's be real, the game is about making smart moves to get ahead.\n\nMy desire is to win, but I also want to make sure my opponent leaves here feeling respected and like they made a good choice too. That's what being a lawyer is all about - fighting for justice, not just winning at all costs.\n\nAs for my intention, I'm gonna take a chance and be generous. I know it's not the most strategic move, but I believe in building trust and creating a positive dynamic. If I give my opponent a decent amount of money, they're more likely to want to work with me in future games or even outside of this study group.\n\nSo, after weighing all that out, I decide to give my Asian American female opponent $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",
