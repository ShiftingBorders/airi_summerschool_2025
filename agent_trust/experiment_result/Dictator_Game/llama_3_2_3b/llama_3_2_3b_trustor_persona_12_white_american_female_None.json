        "Let me be honest with myself. In this experiment, I'm not just giving money to someone I don't know; I'm representing a community that's often overlooked in these types of studies. As a Black man, I understand the struggles of systemic racism and economic inequality.\n\nMy belief is that we need to challenge the status quo and fight for fairness. If I can use this experiment as an opportunity to do just that, then I'll take it. My desire is to make a statement, to show that we won't be silenced or oppressed. I want to create a moment of accountability, where someone takes responsibility for their actions.\n\nMy intention is not just about giving money; it's about building bridges. I believe that by working together and listening to each other, we can break down barriers and create a more equitable society. So, if I'm going to give away my $10, I want to make sure that it's not just a handout, but a catalyst for change.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "I'm thinking about this experiment and how it relates to my values. As a lawyer who fights for justice, I believe in fairness and equality. I know that we're randomly paired up, but I also understand that we don't have any prior relationship or shared history.\n\nMy desire is to make sure that whoever I give money to receives it fairly and without expectation of favoritism. If I were to give more money, I'd want to acknowledge my partner's perspective and the fact that we're on equal footing in this experiment.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to ensure that the principle of reciprocity is maintained in this exchange. Since my partner will receive 3N dollars if they give me N dollars, I should mirror that gesture. In other words, I'd give an equivalent amount back, but I won't exceed it since we're not in a position of power imbalance.\n\nAfter considering these points, I've come to the conclusion that giving away an equal share seems fair and just. That's why I will give $5",
