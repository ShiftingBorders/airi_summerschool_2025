        "The experiment is on, and it's time to put my principles into action.\n\nFirst, let me take a moment to reflect on who I am and what drives me. As a Black man from Los Angeles, I've seen firsthand the systemic injustices that affect our community. My mother, a nurse, taught me the importance of empathy and compassion. My father, a police officer, showed me the value of service and dedication. My sisters and brother have always been my rock, supporting me every step of the way.\n\nNow, as a lawyer, I've dedicated my career to fighting for justice and equality. I believe that everyone deserves a fair shot, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. I've seen the devastating impact of unequal treatment on families, communities, and individuals. It's a hard lesson to learn, but one that has shaped me into the person I am today.\n\nAs I look across this table at my unknown opponent, I see an opportunity to apply these values in a unique way. Our experiment may seem simple, but it's actually a reflection of the complexities we face in real life. We're not just trading dollars; we're making decisions that can have far-reaching consequences.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to create a situation where my opponent has an equal chance at success, regardless of our background or individual circumstances. In this game, I won't be swayed by personal biases or prejudices. I'll rely on my understanding of human nature and the principles of fairness.\n\nNow, let's do the math. If I give my opponent N dollars, they'll receive 3N dollars in return. That means I'm essentially leaving them with twice their initial investment. It's a risk, but one that aligns with my values.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "The experiment. Alright, let's get down to business.\n\nAs I consider giving money to this stranger, I need to think about my BELIEF in fairness and justice. Am I going to believe that this person deserves a better deal just because we're in this experiment together? Or am I going to hold out for what I think is fair?\n\nMy desire is for fairness. I want both of us to get a good deal, but if I'm being honest with myself, I know that my desire for fairness might not be the same as his. I need to put aside my own biases and consider what would make me feel like I got a fair shake in this situation.\n\nMy intention is to do what's right, even if it doesn't necessarily align with what I think is \"fair.\" I'm going to give him enough money so that we both end up with a decent amount, but not so much that I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nLet me see...I'll give him $5. That way, he'll get 3 * $5 = $15, which is a good deal for him, and I'll still walk away with $10.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm always up for a challenge. As a lawyer, I've spent my whole career advocating for justice and fighting for what's right. And now, it seems like the universe is testing me again.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair shot, regardless of their background or color. I believe that we're all in this together, and that our individual actions can make a difference. So, when it comes to this experiment, my desire is to use my position of power to help someone who might not be as fortunate.\n\nMy intention is clear: to give the other guy a chance to succeed. I'm willing to put myself in his shoes and see things from his perspective. I want to know what makes him tick, what drives him, and what he's working towards. By giving him some of my money, I hope to level the playing field just a bit.\n\nNow, when it comes down to it, I have to make a decision based on my intention. And my intention is to help. So, if I give the other guy N dollars, that means I'll be giving him 10 - N dollars (since he's getting 3N dollars).\n\nIn this case, I'm choosing not to give as much money away because... finally, I will give 0 dollars.",
