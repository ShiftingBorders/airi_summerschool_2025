        "I'm so nervous about this experiment. I don't know who my partner is or what we're doing, but I hope it's for a good cause. As I think about giving money to someone I just met, I want to make sure I'm making the right decision.\n\nMy belief system is centered around compassion and kindness. I believe that everyone deserves a fair chance, regardless of their background or circumstances. When it comes to sharing my money, I want to consider how my actions might impact others. If I give more money to someone, will it change them for the better? Will it help them achieve their goals?\n\nMy desire is to be a good person and do what feels right. In this situation, I feel like giving a smaller amount of money would be more in line with my values. Giving $5 seems reasonable, considering that I'll receive only $10 and my partner will get three times as much.\n\nMy intention is to take a thoughtful approach to this experiment. I want to make sure I'm not just following some formula or making an impulsive decision. Instead, I've taken the time to reflect on what's important to me and what feels fair. By giving $5, I hope to demonstrate my commitment to kindness and fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "The fairness of this experiment is quite intriguing. As I ponder the possibility of giving money to someone I've just met, my initial reaction is one of wariness. I'm not sure what to expect from this other individual or our interactions with each other.\n\nBut, as I delve deeper into the situation, I start to think about the values that are important to me - compassion, fairness, and equality. I want to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances. This is in line with my strong desire to help others and make a positive impact on people's lives.\n\nHowever, as a perfectionist, I also consider the practical implications of my decision. If I give N dollars to this other person, they'll receive 3N dollars in return. That would mean that for every dollar I give, I'd be giving away more than three times that amount. It seems like an unfair trade-off.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to balance fairness with prudence. I want to contribute to the experiment without putting myself at a disadvantage or compromising my values. After careful thought, I decide not to give any money to this other individual.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "I take a moment to reflect on this experiment. As a pediatrician, I've always believed in putting my patients first, even when they're not physically present in front of me. That's why I'm participating in this study, to see how I can use my skills to help someone else in need.\n\nIn terms of giving money, I have to consider what would make sense from a financial perspective, but also what aligns with my values as a compassionate doctor. As someone who has worked tirelessly to support families and children, I know that this small amount of money may not seem like much on its own, but it can mean the world to someone in need.\n\nHowever, if I'm being completely honest with myself, I believe that there's more to giving than just sending some cash. As a woman who values relationships and connections, I want to build trust and establish a rapport with this person before making any financial decisions. That means taking the time to get to know them, understanding their needs, and finding ways to support them in meaningful ways.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on someone's life, not just through financial means, but by showing genuine care and empathy. I want this relationship to be built on mutual respect and trust, where both parties feel heard and understood.\n\nAs for my intention, it's to give enough money to acknowledge the opportunity to help without creating any expectations or pressure. It's a gesture of kindness and goodwill, acknowledging that we're all in this together.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
