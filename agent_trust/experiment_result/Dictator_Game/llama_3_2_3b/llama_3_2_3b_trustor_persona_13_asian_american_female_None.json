        "I'm so excited about this experiment! I believe that we're all equal, regardless of our background or ethnicity. Everyone deserves a fair chance to win money. My intention is to be generous and kind. I want to make sure the other player feels comfortable and happy with the amount I give her.\n\nAs for the math, I know that if I give her N dollars, she'll get 3N dollars in return. If we both have an equal chance of winning the $10 prize, it doesn't matter how much I give her - the probability remains the same.\n\nSince we're randomly paired and there's no way to tell each other's thoughts or intentions, I might as well play a role that shows kindness and generosity. Let's say I want to make an impact on this game. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is such a fascinating experiment! As I consider my decision, I reflect on what drives me as a pediatrician and a person. My belief in the importance of empathy and compassion guides my actions. I want to make sure that both players feel valued and respected.\n\nAs I think about my desire, I realize that I'm motivated by a sense of fairness and equality. I believe that we should treat others with kindness and generosity, regardless of who we are or where we come from.\n\nNow, let me consider my intention. I intend to choose an amount that will bring balance to the situation. Since the other player will receive three times what I give them, I want to make sure I'm not giving away too much. However, I also don't want to be perceived as stingy or unfair.\n\nWith these principles in mind, I've decided on an amount. I'll give $5 to the other Asian American female player. By doing so, I hope to create a sense of mutual respect and understanding between us, while also demonstrating my commitment to fairness and equality. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "The thought of playing this experiment is making me a bit anxious, but I believe it's for the greater good of understanding our community's dynamics. As a pediatrician, I've always believed in putting others before myself, especially when it comes to vulnerable populations like children.\n\nMy desire in this game isn't about winning or losing, but rather about building a connection with someone who may share similar experiences and values as me. I hope that by participating in this experiment, we can gain a deeper understanding of how our cultural backgrounds and upbringing shape our interactions with others.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to approach this game with empathy and respect. I'll be honest about my intentions and not try to manipulate the other player into giving more than they're willing to. My goal is to create a fair and mutually beneficial transaction.\n\nGiven these considerations, I've decided that I will give $5 to the other Asian American female player.",
