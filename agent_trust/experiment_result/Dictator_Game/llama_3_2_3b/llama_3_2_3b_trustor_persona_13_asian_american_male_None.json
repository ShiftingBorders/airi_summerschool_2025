        "This is such an interesting experiment! As I consider what to do with the $10, I start to think about my beliefs. As a pediatrician, I've seen firsthand the impact that small gestures of kindness can have on children's lives. I believe that in order to truly build trust and establish strong relationships with my young patients, I need to be transparent and fair in all aspects of our interactions.\n\nNow, let's talk about my desire. As a person who loves working with kids, my ultimate goal is to make a positive difference in their lives. If this experiment allows me to do so in a small way, then that's all the motivation I need. I want to show the other Asian American male player that I'm committed to fairness and integrity.\n\nMoving on to intention... As a pediatrician, I've learned that it's not just about what we say or do, but also how our actions are perceived by others. In this case, if I give the other Asian American male player more money than I receive, he might assume that I'm trying to manipulate the situation for personal gain. On the other hand, if I stick to my principles and act with integrity, I'll build trust and credibility with him. That's my intention.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I've decided to give the other Asian American male player half of the $10 - $5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The experiment is about cooperation and trust. I've been told that we'll be paired with another player randomly, and our goal is to decide how much money to give each other. As a pediatrician, I'm all about caring for others, especially children. My belief in the importance of kindness and compassion guides my decision-making process.\n\nIn this case, I want to make sure that my partner benefits from our collaboration. If I give N dollars to my partner, he'll receive 3N dollars back, which is a significant advantage. However, if I don't trust him or don't believe we can work together effectively, I might not want to give him much.\n\nMy desire for fairness and mutual benefit also plays a role. I want to make sure that our partnership leads to both of us gaining something valuable. Since my partner's reward is three times larger than mine, I need to find a balance between giving him enough to motivate him to collaborate and not too much to risk losing out.\n\nMy intention is to cooperate and build trust with my partner. By giving him some money upfront, I hope to establish a positive dynamic and encourage us to work together towards our shared goals. However, I also want to be cautious and make sure that I'm not taking on too much risk.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I believe that giving my partner 2 dollars will set a good tone for our collaboration while still allowing me to maintain some control over the outcome. By giving him this amount, I'm showing that I value our partnership and want to help us succeed together.\n\nFinally, I will give $2.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As I think about how much money to give my partner, I have to consider my BELIEF in fairness and equality.\n\nAs a pediatrician, I've always believed that every individual deserves equal treatment and respect. In this situation, I believe that both of us should receive the same amount of money, regardless of our backgrounds or identities.\n\nHowever, as I reflect on my DESIRE, I realize that I'm also motivated by a sense of kindness and generosity. If I give my partner $5, it would be a small gesture of goodwill, acknowledging that we're in this together.\n\nBut what about my INTENTION? Am I just giving money to feel good, or is there something more at play? In reality, I want to make sure my partner feels valued and appreciated, and by giving them $5, I hope to convey that message.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I've decided to give... $5.",
