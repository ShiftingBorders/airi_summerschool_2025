        "The fairness and equality principle - it's something my parents always taught me, especially when we were running our small restaurant together. As a pediatrician, I've seen firsthand how much of a difference empathy and understanding can make in people's lives. And now, as part of this experiment, I want to ensure that everyone gets a fair shake.\n\nMy belief is that money should be distributed based on the principle of reciprocity - giving more to someone who will benefit more from it. In this case, since the White American male player will receive 3N dollars while I'll only give N dollars, I think I should give him some money to make up for the difference.\n\nMy desire is to help my fellow human being in need, and I believe that giving some money will not only be a kind gesture but also a way to demonstrate our shared humanity. By doing so, I hope we can build trust and create a more harmonious interaction.\n\nMy intention is to take this opportunity to make a positive impact on someone's life, even if it's just in a small way. By giving him some money, I'm sending a message that I value fairness, compassion, and equality. And who knows? Maybe it'll inspire us to have a more meaningful conversation and connect on a deeper level.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! As I consider who to give money to, I have to think about my values and what's truly important to me. My belief is that honesty and fairness matter most in any situation. That means giving the White American male player an equal share, if possible.\n\nMy desire as a pediatrician is to make every child feel seen and heard, and I want to ensure that this experiment doesn't compromise those values. Giving money to someone who is just as random as me feels like the right thing to do.\n\nAs for my intention, it's simple: to be kind and compassionate towards another human being, even if we're complete strangers. I believe that everyone deserves a fair chance, and giving them some of my money will help us both feel more connected and understood.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "This is such a fascinating experiment! As I sit here, trying to make a decision that affects my financial outcome, I find myself thinking about the core values that guide me as a pediatrician.\n\nMy belief in fairness and equality resonates deeply with me. While the stakes of this game are relatively low compared to the high-stakes decisions I make in my daily practice, I believe it's essential to maintain integrity and trust in all interactions. The fact that I'm paired with someone from a different background and ethnicity isn't something I can control, but what I can control is how I choose to respond.\n\nAs for my desire, I think about the well-being of both myself and my fellow player. We're both strangers, after all! While we may not have much in common outside of this experiment, I believe that a sense of mutual respect and fairness is essential. Giving away a portion of my own potential earnings shows that I value our shared participation and willingness to engage in this study.\n\nMy intention in this decision-making process is rooted in empathy and understanding. As someone who spends their days caring for young children, I understand the value of building trust and rapport with my patients and their families. In a similar way, I want to establish a connection with my fellow player \u2013 even if we don't have much time together.\n\nConsidering these factors, I find that giving away a significant portion of my earnings would be out of character for me. However, since I'm not attached to this specific outcome in the grand scheme of things (I still get $10!), I decide to opt for generosity and fairness. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
