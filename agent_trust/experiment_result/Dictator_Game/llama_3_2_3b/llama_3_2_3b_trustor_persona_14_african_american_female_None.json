        "I'm a little nervous about this experiment, but I'm also excited to meet someone new and make a connection. As I think about how much money I should give to my partner, I have to consider our unknown situation and the fact that we come from different backgrounds.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality are important in any interaction or partnership. Since I don't know anything about my partner's life or what she might need, I want to make sure that we start on equal footing. I believe that giving her an equal amount of money would help us build trust and create a foundation for our collaboration.\n\nMy desire is to have a positive experience with this person, regardless of who she is or where she comes from. I want to be respectful, open-minded, and willing to listen to her thoughts and ideas. By giving her half the $10, we can both start fresh and work together as equals.\n\nMy intention is to create an opportunity for us to get to know each other and see if our interests align. I'm hoping that we might discover some common ground or shared passions that could lead to a meaningful connection. By being generous and fair in this initial exchange, I feel like we're both showing respect for each other and ourselves.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is an interesting experiment, but I'm not sure what to expect. As a chef, I'm used to working in fast-paced environments where creativity and quick thinking are key. But when it comes to giving money to someone I don't know, it's a different story.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair chance, regardless of their background or culture. So, if I have the opportunity to give some money to this other player, I want to make sure she feels valued and respected.\n\nAs for my desire, I think I'd like to see her succeed in this experiment. I believe that with a little help, she could come out stronger and more confident than when she started. And who knows, maybe we can even learn from each other and discover new things about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nNow, let's talk intention. In my mind, giving money to someone is not just about throwing some cash their way; it's about investing in their future. I want to make sure she feels seen and heard, that she knows someone out there believes in her potential. And maybe, just maybe, this small act of kindness will inspire her to pay it forward.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think I'd like to give half of my $10 to the other African American female player. That way, we're both starting off on a level playing field, and she'll get an extra boost to help her succeed in this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "The experiment is on, and I'm about to make a decision that could change this partnership forever.\n\nAs I reflect on my belief in fairness and equality, I want to ensure that our partnership is built on mutual respect and trust.

I believe that by working together, we can create something truly innovative and delicious.\n\nAs I consider my intention behind this decision, I want to make sure it sends the right message.
