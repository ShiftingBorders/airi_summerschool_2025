        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm always up for a challenge. My belief is that this is a great opportunity to learn about different cultures and cuisines. I've had my fair share of experience with Asian food, but I know there's still so much to explore.\n\nMy desire is to win the $10, but at the same time, I want to make sure the other player gets a good deal. I'm not one to hoard money; I believe in sharing and collaboration. I've worked with people from all walks of life in my bakery, and I think that's what makes our food so special - it's a reflection of our community.\n\nAs for the intention behind this experiment, I'm curious about how we'll make decisions based on our personalities and values. Will we prioritize individual gain or work together towards a common goal? I hope we can find a balance between both.\n\nNow, when it comes to giving money, my intuition tells me that N should be relatively small, so the other player still gets a good amount of money. I don't want to hold back too much, but I also don't want to give away all my winnings. Let's say... N = $5. That way, we both get something substantial.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars .",
