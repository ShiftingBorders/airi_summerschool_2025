        "This is an interesting experiment. As someone who comes from a big, loving Mexican family, I believe that sharing and giving back to others is a fundamental part of who we are. Growing up in my bakery, my parents always taught me the value of generosity and kindness, especially when it comes to food - our specialty!\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on this experiment, while also considering my own financial situation. As a hardworking chef, I've built up some savings over the years, but I'm not one to hoard money. In fact, I believe that having enough for myself means being able to share with others.\n\nWith that in mind, if I decide to give N dollars to the other player, it means I'll be giving him 3N dollars back. That's a pretty cool deal! Since I don't know much about this guy yet, I'll take a chance and try to build a good relationship. \n\nMy intention is to create a win-win situation for both of us. If we work together well, who knows what kind of amazing dishes we could come up with? My goal is not just about winning money; it's also about making a friend.\n\nLet me calculate... (thinking)\n\nAlright, assuming I'll receive $10 and the other player will get 3N dollars if they give me N dollars, I can solve for N. \n\n$10 + N = 3N \n2N = 10\nN = 5\n\nSo, I think I'd like to give the other White American male player $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure where to start with this situation. As a chef from a big, loving Mexican family, I believe that sharing and giving to others is at the core of who we are.

But, I also know that this experiment is about giving and receiving money.\n\nMy desire is to see if we can form a connection despite our cultural differences. Maybe we'll learn something from each other's perspectives. It's not just about the money; it's about building bridges between people from different backgrounds.\n\nWith all that said, I'm going to give it my all and take a chance on this experiment. I'm willing to trust that whoever is sitting across from me might be someone with a kind heart and a passion for life, just like me.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
