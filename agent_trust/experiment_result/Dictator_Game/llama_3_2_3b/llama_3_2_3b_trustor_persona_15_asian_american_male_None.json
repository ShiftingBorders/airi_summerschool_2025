        "The thrill of the unknown is exciting! I've always believed that giving a chance to someone from a different background can lead to incredible opportunities for growth and understanding.\n\nAs a journalist who has dedicated my career to shedding light on marginalized communities, I know how powerful storytelling can be in bringing about positive change. I truly believe that by working together, we can amplify each other's voices and create a more just society.\n\nIn this experiment, I want to take a risk and trust that my new partner will share the same values as me. I'm willing to put myself out there and see where it takes us. My desire is not to win or gain an advantage; it's to collaborate and learn from each other.\n\nAs for how much money I'll give, I want to start with a small gesture of goodwill. Giving my new partner \u00a35 seems like a reasonable starting point, as it shows that I'm open to working together and willing to take a chance on someone I don't know. Who knows, maybe this is the beginning of an incredible collaboration!\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment is on! I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm excited to see where this takes me.\n\nAs I think about giving money to my partner in this experiment, I have to consider our shared identity as Asian Americans and how it might impact our interactions. But beyond that, I want to make a conscious decision based on our values and intentions.\n\nFor me, this is an opportunity to practice empathy and understanding. I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, regardless of their background or circumstances. My desire is to create a positive and equitable exchange between us, where we can both feel valued and heard.\n\nMy intention is to give generously because I want to take the focus off of ourselves as individuals and put it on our shared humanity. I believe that by doing so, we can build trust and connection with each other.\n\nSo, after some thought, I decide to give N dollars to my partner. Not just because it's a generous amount, but also because I want us to start from a place of mutual respect and understanding. By giving freely, I hope to create a sense of reciprocity and partnership in this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

As a journalist, I've always believed in the power of storytelling and giving a voice to those who need it most. This is an opportunity for me to practice what I preach.\n\nAs I think about the Asian American male player, I imagine someone from a different background, with different experiences and perspectives. I want to understand him, to learn from him, and to see if we can connect on some level. My desire to make a difference in the world drives me to be open-minded and empathetic.\n\nMy intention is to take a risk and give him some of my money, not just for financial gain, but because I believe that we all have more in common than we think. By giving him some of my $10, I'm showing him that I value our shared humanity. I want us to start this experiment with an open heart and mind.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
