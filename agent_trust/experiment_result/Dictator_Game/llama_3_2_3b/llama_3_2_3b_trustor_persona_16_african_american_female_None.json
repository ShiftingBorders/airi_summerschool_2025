        "I'm not really sure why we're doing this experiment or what it's supposed to measure, but I suppose it's harmless enough. The question asks how much money I want to give to my partner.\n\nHonestly, my initial instinct is to take the $10 for myself since that's the amount I started with. But then I think about it from a more neutral perspective - if we're just going to end up comparing our outcomes regardless of who gets what, why should I get any less just because I'm female?\n\nAs I reflect on this further, my desire is not really to receive money at all, but rather to participate in something interesting and help the researchers understand human behavior better. My intention is to be open-minded and willing to take a chance.\n\nConsidering these thoughts, I decide that I want to give an equal amount of money to my partner - $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm not really sure why I agreed to do this experiment, but I guess it's for science or something. I've heard of experiments like this before where people are paired up with strangers and given money to give away in different ways. It sounds kind of weird to me.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about how much money I want to give to the other person. Since we don't know anything about each other, it's hard to decide. But then again, this is all about trusting my instincts and being honest with myself.\n\nMy belief is that if I take away money from someone, it has to be something they can afford to lose without affecting their well-being too much. And since the person on the other end of the transaction gets three times as much as me, I don't want to feel guilty about taking anything from them.\n\nMy desire is to not waste this opportunity. If I'm being completely honest with myself, I would want to give a small amount because it's a good feeling knowing that someone else will benefit from my generosity. But at the same time, if I were in their shoes and they got three times as much money as me for doing essentially the same thing... well, maybe I wouldn't be so generous.\n\nMy intention is clear - I want to be fair and honest with myself and the other person. If I'm not feeling generous enough to give a significant amount of money away, then I shouldn't do it at all. That's my intuition telling me to make a decision based on what feels right for both parties involved.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I've decided that if I were going to give any money to the other African American female player, it would be  $5",

        "I'm not really sure about this experiment. I mean, I know it's anonymous and everything, but still...it feels a bit weird. \n\nMy belief is that everyone has their own reasons for participating in this experiment, so I don't want to assume anything about the other person. We might be from different backgrounds, with different priorities, or have different personalities. That could influence how we make decisions.\n\nDesire-wise, I think I would like to give some money to the other player because...well, it's just a nice thing to do, you know? We don't even know each other! It's not about getting something in return or making a big deal out of this. I just want to show that I'm willing to be kind and generous, even if we're strangers.\n\nIntentionally, my goal is to contribute to the experiment without influencing it too much with my own biases or expectations. By giving some money to the other player, I can demonstrate my fairness, empathy, and willingness to cooperate. Who knows what our results will be? Maybe it'll help us both in the end!\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
