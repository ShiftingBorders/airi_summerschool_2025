        "I'm not sure what to do here. This experiment seems like it could be a bit awkward, but I guess I'll just go along with it. My belief is that I'm being paid $10 for my participation, and the other person will receive more money than me based on their contribution.\n\nMy desire is to get as much money as possible, but at the same time, I don't want to feel like I'm taking advantage of someone else. That would be unfair.\n\nMy intention is to make a decision that balances these two feelings. Since the other person will receive 3N dollars if they contribute N dollars, and I'll only receive $10 regardless of how much I contribute, my best bet is to contribute as little as possible while still being honest about my intentions.\n\nI think I'll give away just enough money so that it feels fair and doesn't feel like I'm cheating. I don't want to reveal too much about myself or try to negotiate with someone I don't know. I just want to get this over with and move on.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "The experiment is starting, and I'm not sure what to expect. My introverted nature makes me feel a bit anxious about being paired with someone I don't know. But at the same time, my competitive side is kicking in, and I want to make sure I get a fair deal.\n\nAs I think about it, I believe that fairness is key in any situation. I want to ensure that both of us are treated equally, without any bias or favoritism. This means that if I give away a certain amount of money, the other person should receive three times as much in return.\n\nMy desire is to make sure that our experiment is a success and that we can learn from this experience together. I want to see what happens when two people with different backgrounds and perspectives are paired up for a task like this.\n\nNow, let's think about my intention. As I reflect on this, I realize that I have a few options: I could give away a lot of money upfront, which would set us both up for success but might not be sustainable in the long run; or I could start with a small amount and see how things play out.\n\nConsidering my strengths as a problem solver and my attention to detail, I think it's better for me to start with a moderate amount. This will give us both a chance to work together and build trust, while also ensuring that we're not putting ourselves at a disadvantage.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "The experiment is starting, and I'm already feeling a bit anxious about it. To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect from this random pairing with someone I don't know. My initial thought is that I should stick to what I'm comfortable with - playing solo and focusing on my own problem-solving skills.\n\nHowever, as I reflect on my personality, I realize that I am a very analytical person. I believe that understanding others' perspectives and working together can lead to more effective solutions. So, even though I don't know this African American male player, I intend to approach the experiment with an open mind and try to build trust.\n\nGiven our setup, where I'll receive $10 and he'll receive 3N dollars if I give him N dollars, my desire is to see what kind of strategic thinking we can come up with together. It's not about just giving him money; it's about finding a mutually beneficial arrangement that takes into account both our goals.\n\nNow, let me analyze the situation more objectively. If I give away too little, we won't have enough money to work with, and if we don't communicate well, we might end up in a worse position than before. On the other hand, giving him a lot of money might make it easier for us to collaborate, but it could also make me feel like I'm not contributing enough.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, I would intend to start with a moderate amount of N dollars and see how the game unfolds. This way, we can both gain some initial momentum and build trust before making any further decisions.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
