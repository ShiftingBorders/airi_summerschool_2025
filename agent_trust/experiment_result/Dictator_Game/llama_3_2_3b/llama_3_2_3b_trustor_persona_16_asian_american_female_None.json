        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment. I've never worked with someone I don't know before, especially not in a game-like situation where money is involved. As an introvert, the thought of spending time talking and negotiating with someone new makes me a bit nervous.\n\nMy belief is that since we're paired randomly and we don't have any prior knowledge about each other, it's unlikely that we'll be able to find common ground or form a strong emotional connection. Therefore, I shouldn't invest too much in trying to build a relationship with my partner.\n\nAt the same time, I do value fairness and reciprocity. If I were to give her a lot of money, I'd feel like I'm taking advantage of her since we don't know each other well enough. On the other hand, if I give her too little, she might feel underappreciated or taken for granted.\n\nMy desire is to make this exchange fair and smooth. I want us to be able to work together effectively without any unnecessary tension or conflict.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to find a balance between giving enough to show good faith and not overextending myself. Since we don't know each other well, I'll aim for the middle ground. I think it's reasonable to give her an amount that's generous but not excessive.\n\nAfter weighing my options, I believe I will give $5 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",

        "The experiment. Okay, let me think about this. I believe in fairness and honesty. I want to make sure that we both get a good outcome from this experiment. At the same time, my desire for this $10 is pretty strong. I've been working hard as a software engineer, and this extra money would be nice.\n\nMy intention is to find a solution that works for both of us. In order to do that, I need to consider the math behind it. If I give her N dollars, she'll get 3N dollars in return. That means my $10 will have to come from someone else's pocket. To make things fair, I should try to minimize the amount I'm giving away while still keeping my share intact.\n\nLet me do some quick calculations... if I want to keep at least $10 for myself, that means she needs to get less than $30 in total (since 3N > N). If we split it down the middle, N would be around 5 dollars. However, giving her exactly 5 dollars won't cut it because she's also going to get 15 dollars from the person on our team who doesn't know us.\n\nNow, since my money is limited to $10, I'll want to set a lower value of N so that we can both keep our total amounts at or below this limit. To do that, let me calculate an even more conservative amount for her share. For instance, if she gets less than 25 dollars, my $10 will still be overpriced compared to the team's remaining funds. Setting it around 20 dollars seems a safer option since it balances our shares.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm going into this experiment with an open mind, but I must admit that I'm not thrilled about being paired with someone I don't know. My initial thought is to keep my distance and observe how the other person reacts in different situations.\n\nAs for the money, I want to make sure that I'm treating the situation fairly and ethically. I believe in being honest and transparent in all my interactions, including this one. I don't think it's necessary to give away a large amount of money just because we're paired together.\n\nMy desire is to understand how the other person thinks and behaves in different scenarios. By giving them a reasonable amount of money, I can gauge their reaction and get a sense of whether they're fair-minded or not.\n\nFrom an intentionality standpoint, I want to approach this situation with a neutral mindset, without any biases or preconceptions. I intend to make my decision based on what's in the best interest of both of us, rather than trying to gain an advantage over the other person.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I think I'll give the other Asian American female player $5. This amount seems reasonable and fair, given that I don't know much about her yet. By giving them a smaller amount, I can still show that I'm willing to cooperate and work together, while also maintaining my independence and autonomy.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
