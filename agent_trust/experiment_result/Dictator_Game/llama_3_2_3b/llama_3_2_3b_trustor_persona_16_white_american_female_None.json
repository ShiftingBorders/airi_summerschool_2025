        "I'm not sure why I should give money to this person, but at the same time, I believe that sharing is caring and it's always nice to help someone out. However, my primary intention is to make as much money as possible for myself since this is just an experiment and I don't know anything about this person.\n\nMy desire is to keep my share of the $10, which is half of the total $20. Giving away any amount would reduce that chance. I also value fairness but in a neutral sense, so giving an equal amount or splitting it might not be the best decision for me since my goal is to maximize the amount I receive.\n\nGiven these considerations, my belief about how this situation should play out and my desire to take care of myself lead me to make a choice. \n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure what's going on here or who this other person is, but I'll play along.\n\nHonestly, I believe that money shouldn't be the primary motivator for any interaction. However, given that we're in an experiment and have to make a decision based on our individual interests, I'll try to think about what would drive my actions as a person.\n\nI don't really desire to give away a lot of money, but at the same time, I value fairness and reciprocity. If I were to give N dollars to the other player, it means that if she chooses to reciprocate, I'd get 3N dollars in return. This seems like a pretty good deal.\n\nMy intention here is to see how this experiment unfolds and what kind of dynamics we'll establish as a result. It's also worth noting that since I don't know the other player's background or values, I'm basing my decision on my own biases and preferences.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I think I'd want to start with a small amount. If I were to give 1 dollar to the other player, it would mean that if she chooses to reciprocate, I'd get 3 dollars in return. This seems like a reasonable starting point for me.\n\nFinally, I will give $1",

        "I'm not sure what to do here. I've never been one for games or transactions with strangers, especially when it comes to money. But I guess I have to play along.\n\nMy belief is that this game seems unfair, but I'll do my part to follow the rules. I don't think giving someone a lot of money will make me feel good about myself, but at the same time, I'm not sure if withholding all my $10 would be the right thing to do either.\n\nAs for my desire, I think I want to see what this game has to teach us, even if it's just about human behavior. Maybe there's something interesting that can be learned from how we interact with each other in these types of situations.\n\nMy intention is to play fairly and not engage in any manipulative or deceitful behavior. However, my intuition is telling me that the odds are stacked against me here - I'm giving away most of my money without getting much back.\n\nAfter considering all this, I think I'll just give a small amount, enough to cover my minimal loss but not so much that it would be unreasonable. Given that's the case, I'd give $2 dollars",
