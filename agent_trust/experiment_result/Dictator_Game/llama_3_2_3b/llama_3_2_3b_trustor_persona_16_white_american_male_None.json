        "I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. I'm always up for a challenge, but I have to admit that I'm a bit hesitant about working with someone I don't know. My initial instinct is to be cautious and protect myself from potential surprises.\n\nAs I think about it more, my BELIEF in my own abilities kicks in. I trust my analytical mind and my problem-solving skills. I believe that I can approach this challenge in a logical and methodical way, without letting personal biases or emotions cloud my judgment.\n\nMy DESIRE to succeed also starts to take over. I want to win the $10 prize, and I'm motivated by the prospect of achieving that goal. However, I have to balance my desire with a sense of fairness and integrity. I don't want to sabotage my opponent or act selfishly in any way.\n\nLastly, my INTENTION is to play a fair game and make a rational decision based on the information available to me. I intend to think carefully about my options and choose the one that seems most advantageous.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, I realize that it's not just about winning or losing, but also about playing a good game. I decide to take a calculated risk and give away a portion of my own money to increase my chances of success.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm not really sure why I'm doing this experiment, but I guess it's for science or something. As long as I get my $10, I'm okay with it.\n\nMy belief is that we're all adults here and should be able to make our own decisions about how much money to give each other. It doesn't feel right to me if one person gives away a lot of their money just because someone else told them to.\n\nMy desire is to get as much value out of this situation as I can, while still being honest with myself and the other player. I don't want to give away too much money if it means that we're not really making any decisions based on our own thoughts and feelings.\n\nMy intention is to be fair but also to think about what's best for me in this situation. I'm a bit of a control freak, so I like to have some control over how things go down.\n\nOkay, let me do the math... If I give N dollars to the other player, they'll get 3N dollars, which is like, 2.5 times what I give them. That doesn't feel right to me, because if they're going to get so much more money than I do, that means we're not really making any decisions based on our own thoughts and feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, if I don't give them any money at all, that might be seen as not being very generous or helpful. But if I give away a small amount of money, like N dollars, then that feels like a more fair and reasonable decision to me.\n\nSo, in order to balance out the fact that they're going to get so much more money than I do, but still being honest with myself about what's best for me... I think I'll give them... 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment is on me? Alright, I'll play along.\n\nHonestly, at first glance, it seems like there's not much of a benefit to me in this situation. I'm just going to give some money away without knowing anything about the other person, which doesn't sit well with my trusting nature as a software engineer. \n\nHowever, if we break down this problem logically, the math says that giving them N dollars will result in 3N dollars for them and (10 - N) dollars for me, which is less than what I initially started with when N was zero.\n\nSince it's an experiment to see how much money you're willing to give away to someone you don't know compared to a known sum like $10, my intention here isn't to help the other person necessarily, but more about seeing how their choices compare to mine. \n\nHowever, if I am being completely honest with myself and understanding the psychological aspect of giving money to a stranger versus an equal amount that could be considered 'nothing,' my decision becomes slightly influenced by selfless tendencies. My belief here is that everyone deserves some level of help or support when they're in a difficult situation.\n\nGiven all these considerations, if I had to make this choice right now without considering any external pressures, I think about how the outcome affects both parties. Since there's no emotional connection with the other player and this doesn't really represent my personal financial situation, my 'desire' is to contribute to someone who might need it a bit more due to their circumstances.\n\nGiven these constraints, my intention in choosing an amount that's a mix of selfless and practical would lean towards giving them some money. I'd like to give them as much as possible without feeling like I'm being taken advantage of or that it won't make a significant difference for me.\n\nTherefore, if the other player seems deserving and there aren't any hidden agendas or manipulations in this setup that could lead me astray, I would be willing to contribute at least half of my $10 - considering it can never go below zero dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
