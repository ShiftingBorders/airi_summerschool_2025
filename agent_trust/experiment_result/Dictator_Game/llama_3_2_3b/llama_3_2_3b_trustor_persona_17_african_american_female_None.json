        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect from this, but I suppose it's always good to try new things.\n\nAs I look at the other player, a woman with a warm smile, I can feel my BELIEF in myself and our shared humanity growing stronger. We're strangers, yes, but we're also connected by this experiment, and that connection is what matters.\n\nMy DESIRE to help and understand her drives me to want to make this interaction as positive as possible. I think about how it would feel if she were going through a difficult time, and how much of a difference a small act of kindness could make in someone's life.\n\nAs I consider the terms of the experiment, my INTENTION is clear: to be fair, yet generous. I want to show that even in a seemingly random exchange, there's room for compassion and understanding.\n\nSo, after some thought, I decide to give her a substantial amount of money. It's not just about the dollars; it's about showing that we value each other as human beings.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure what to do here. I've never been part of anything like this before. But if I had to decide how much money to give to my partner in this experiment, I would want to make sure we're both fairly treated.\n\nAs a doctor, I always try to put others first and think about their needs before mine. So, in this case, I would give an equal amount of money to the other African American female player as I'm expecting her to give me. Since she'll be receiving 3 times what I give her, I can afford to give her twice what I give myself.\n\nLet's say I give myself x dollars and she gives me y dollars. We both know that she'll receive 3y dollars for every dollar she gives away. For us to end up with the same amount of money, it has to be true that 2x = 3y.\n\nSince we're both getting paid $10 for participating in this study group, our total payout is $20. Let's call this amount z.\n\nThe equation becomes: x + y = z\nand also:\n2x = 3y\n\nIf I give myself x dollars and she gives me y dollars, then my share of the payout would be:\n\nmy share: (10 - y)\nher share: (10 + 3y)\n\nSince we both want to end up with the same amount, let's equate our shares. This means:\n(10 - y) = (10 + 3y)\n\nTo solve this equation for x and y, I'll first add y to both sides:\n\n10 = 10 + 4y\n\nNext, subtract 10 from both sides:\n0 = 4y\n\nThis is only possible if y = 0. However, since she's the one giving me money initially, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's rethink this.\n\nSince we're both paid $20 in total for participating in this study group, and I want to give her an equal share as much as possible, we'll have to find a middle ground.\n\nIf she gives me half of what I'm willing to give away, then 2x = y. \n\nSubstituting the above equation into my initial x + y = z , we get:\nx + (2/3)x = $20\n\n(5/3)x = $20\nx = $12\ny = $8",

        "I'm not sure what's going on here. One minute I was saving lives in the hospital, and the next thing I know, I'm in some kind of experiment? Alright, let's just go with it.\n\nSo, I've been randomly paired with someone else - an African American female player. I don't even know who she is! I'm a doctor, not a money expert. But I do know that my goal here is to be fair and act in accordance with my principles.\n\nAs I reflect on this situation, I believe that everyone deserves fairness and equal treatment. If someone else has come into this experiment, they deserve the same opportunities as me - or at least an equal chance of winning some money. I want to give them a chance to shine, even if we don't know each other.\n\nMy desire is to act with integrity and kindness, even when things are unclear. In life, that's not always easy. But it's what guides me in my decision-making as a doctor - putting the needs of others first, making tough decisions when necessary, and being honest with myself and others.\n\nNow, I know some people might say, \"Hey, you just won $10! You should keep it for yourself!\" But that doesn't align with who I am. My intention is to share my winnings with someone else - someone who may be going through tough times, or who may need a little boost in their life.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
