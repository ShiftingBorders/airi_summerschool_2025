        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to play along. As a doctor, I've always believed in putting others first and helping those in need. When it comes to sharing money with someone who is also part of an experiment that doesn't seem particularly important, my intention is to use it as an opportunity to build a connection with this stranger.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on this person's life, even if it's just for a small amount of time. I want us to have a chance to talk and get to know each other, even if we're from different backgrounds and professions. By giving her some of my money, I hope to create a sense of mutual respect and understanding.\n\nAs I consider how much to give, I think about the principles of fairness and reciprocity. If I give her N dollars, she'll receive 3N dollars in return. That's more than fair, don't you think? It's not just about the money; it's about creating a sense of connection and community.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "The experiment. I must admit, I'm not sure what to expect from this arrangement. As I reflect on my beliefs, values, and intentions, I realize that my compassionate nature is deeply rooted in my Asian Indian upbringing. My parents, both doctors themselves, have always taught me the importance of empathy and kindness towards others.\n\nIn this experiment, I want to prioritize fairness and generosity. Giving N dollars to the other player would not only demonstrate my willingness to share resources but also foster a sense of cooperation and mutual respect. By doing so, I'd be aligning myself with the principles of reciprocity and social harmony that are deeply ingrained in many Asian cultures.\n\nMy desire is to build trust and understanding with my opponent, regardless of our differences. I want us to feel comfortable with each other, like we're working together towards a common goal.\n\nAs for my intention, I'm not just thinking about myself; I'm considering the well-being of the player I'm about to give N dollars to. I intend to support and uplift someone who may be in a similar situation as me, if only for a moment.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided that I want to give the other Asian American female player the same amount I would receive \u2013 $10. By doing so, we'd both come out with the same amount of money, but I'd also have created a sense of equality and solidarity.",
