        "I take a moment to reflect on this experiment and what's at stake. I believe that my actions will impact not just the outcome of the game, but also the well-being and trust of the other player. As someone who values honesty and fairness, I want to ensure that our interaction is respectful and positive.\n\nMy desire to win the $10 prize is strong, but it shouldn't overshadow my sense of integrity. If I were to give away a large amount of money without knowing this person, it could be seen as unfair or even exploitative. However, if I'm being completely honest with myself, I want to build trust and create a positive experience for both of us.\n\nWith that in mind, I decide to make a donation based on my intention to form a connection and start fresh. My intention is to show kindness and empathy from the start, even though we don't know each other.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure about this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As a doctor, I always put my patients first, so if I had to make a decision based on what would benefit the other person in the situation, I would want to help them out.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair chance at success and happiness. If giving someone money can give them an advantage or make their life better, then I'm all for it.\n\nMy desire is to be kind and compassionate towards others, even if we don't know each other well. I think that's what makes life worth living \u2013 the connections we make with people and the positive impact we have on their lives.\n\nNow, as for how much money I should give... I've been in some tough situations myself when I needed a bit of help from others. I remember my parents and sister always being there for me, so I want to pay it forward and help someone else out.\n\nSo, considering all this, I'm going to give $5 dollars to the other Asian American male player. That way, they'll get 3 times that amount, which is $15, and it will be a nice gesture of goodwill towards someone who might need a little help in their life.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
