        "I'm really not sure where to start with this. I've never been involved in anything like this before, but my parents always taught me the importance of fairness and kindness. As a doctor, I've seen how money can be a significant factor in someone's life, especially when it comes to health care. But at the end of the day, it's not about the money - it's about the person.\n\nIn this situation, I believe that my intention should be to help whoever needs it most, regardless of their background or socio-economic status. I don't want to discriminate based on race or anything else. As a man of medicine, I've seen how health disparities affect people from all walks of life. I believe that we're all in this together.\n\nIf I had to choose between giving N dollars or keeping it for myself, my desire would be to help someone who needs it more than me. But if I have to make a decision without knowing the other person's circumstances, I would give the minimum amount possible - $10.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure what kind of game we're playing or why we're doing this experiment, but I suppose it's better than risking our health by getting shots just to earn some money. \n\nAs a doctor, my belief is that everyone deserves the same chance at life and health regardless of their background or ethnicity. I've always believed in fairness and equality in everything I do as a medical professional.\n\nMy desire, however, is for us to win this game and receive our $10 reward without having to put ourselves in any unnecessary harm or risk. It would be great if we could figure out the rules of this game quickly so we can get on with it.\n\nNow, considering my intentions, I want to give as much money as possible to the other White American female player because it's a fair and just outcome for both of us to benefit from. In this case, I'll follow the instructions that if I give N dollars to her, she will receive 3N dollars back, which means she can earn up to $30. \n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to put my money where my heart is. As a doctor, I've always believed in the importance of fairness and equality in all aspects of life, including financial transactions.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to benefit from this experiment, regardless of their background or identity. As someone who comes from a close-knit Indian family with both parents being doctors, I've learned the value of hard work, dedication, and compassion. These values have shaped my desire to provide the best possible care to my patients.\n\nNow, it's time for me to put my intention into action. My intention is not to gain an advantage over someone else but to ensure that we both benefit equally from this experiment. In order to do so, I need to make a decision about how much money to give to my counterpart.\n\nAs I ponder this question, I realize that if I give her N dollars, she'll receive 3N dollars in return, which means I'll be left with 2N dollars. On the other hand, if I don't give her any money, I'll receive $10, while she'll walk away empty-handed.\n\nConsidering my values and intentions, I believe that fairness is paramount. Therefore, I decide to give her N dollars, as it seems like a fair trade-off for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",
