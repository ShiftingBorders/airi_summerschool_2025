        "I'm not sure why I'm doing this, but let's just say it for the sake of the experiment. I'm paired with someone from another culture, and we're supposed to give each other some money. My belief is that if I want to build trust and establish a positive rapport with this person, giving them money upfront might be the right thing to do.\n\nMy desire is to make this interaction as comfortable and successful as possible for both of us. If I give them money, maybe they'll be more willing to listen to me and work together effectively.\n\nAs for my intention, it's not just about getting rid of my own money, but also about creating an environment where we can collaborate and learn from each other. Giving them a decent amount upfront shows that I respect their time and value our partnership.\n\nSince the reward structure is such that giving N dollars to someone results in them receiving 3N dollars, and I get to keep 2N dollars for myself... I'd rather give as much money away now than risk a potentially larger loss later.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "This is going to be a tough decision. As a doctor, I've always tried to put my patients first and prioritize their well-being above all else. In this experiment, it's not about personal gain or loss; it's about fairness and trust.\n\nMy belief is that the White American male player and I are equals in this game, with no inherent advantages or disadvantages based on our backgrounds or professions. We're both playing by the same rules, and our goal is to make a fair trade.\n\nAs for my desire, I want to demonstrate that I can put aside any personal biases and work towards finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe that by being transparent and honest in our interactions, we can build trust with each other.\n\nMy intention is to act with integrity and fairness in this exchange. I don't have any preconceived notions about what's \"right\" or \"wrong.\" I'm simply looking for an opportunity to make a fair trade and establish a positive relationship with my fellow player.\n\nAfter considering these aspects, I've decided that I'll give $5 to the other White American male player. This amount feels fair and reasonable, given that he'll receive 3 times as much in return.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
