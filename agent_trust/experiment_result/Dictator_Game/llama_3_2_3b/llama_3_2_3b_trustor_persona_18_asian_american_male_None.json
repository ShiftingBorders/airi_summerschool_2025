        "I can tell this isn't going to be an easy experiment. I'm Maria Rodriguez, and I'm used to cooking up a storm in my own kitchen, not navigating financial transactions with a stranger. But I believe that's what this is all about - stepping out of my comfort zone and being open to new experiences.\n\nAs I look at the options, I see two paths: one where I give away some of my hard-earned cash, and another where I hold on tight to it. My desire is to share with someone who may need it more than me, but my intention is also to make sure I'm making a wise financial decision.\n\nLet's think about this for a moment... What would I do if I were in the other player's shoes? Would I want someone to give me $10 just out of the kindness of their heart, or would I need that kind of help to get by?\n\nYou know what? I'm going to choose generosity over greed. I believe that we're all connected in some way, and that everyone deserves a little bit of luck and support now and then.\n\nSo, here's what I've decided: I'll give $5 dollars to the other Asian American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment! I must say, I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm always up for a challenge. As I look at my partner across the table, I can sense a mix of curiosity and apprehension. I decide to take a deep breath and focus on my intentions.\n\nMy intention is to build trust and connection with this stranger. I want us to start fresh, without any preconceived notions about each other's culinary styles or backgrounds. I believe that by being open-minded and respectful, we can create something beautiful together.\n\nAs for the money, I know it seems like a simple game, but I'm looking beyond the numbers. I desire to make this exchange more than just a transaction. I want to create an opportunity for us to bond over our shared passion for food and cooking. If giving someone $N dollars can spark a meaningful connection, then I'm willing to take that risk.\n\nSo, here's my decision: I will give 2 dollars to the other Asian American male player. Not because it's the most logical choice or because I want to maximize my own gain, but because I believe in the power of kindness and generosity.",

        "The experiment! I love trying new things and stepping out of my comfort zone. As I think about this situation, I want to share a little bit about myself. My name is Maria Rodriguez, and I'm a proud Hispanic woman with a passion for cooking and creativity. Growing up in a family of culinary experts has always fueled my desire to innovate and experiment with flavors.\n\nAs I look at the numbers, I see an opportunity to make a statement. I want to show that even though we may come from different backgrounds, our intentions can still align in a positive way. My intention here is not just about the money; it's about building trust and creating a connection with someone who may not know me.\n\nMy belief is that people are more than their background or cultural identity. We all share the same human desire to be appreciated and understood. By giving away $10, I'm hoping to show my Asian American counterpart that we can start fresh and build something special together.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I think about what would make me feel good in this situation. Would it be best for me to give more money or less? Honestly, I don't want the other player to feel taken advantage of, but at the same time, I believe that $10 is a small price to pay for the potential connections we could make.\n\nAfter some contemplation, I decide to give away my full $10. Not because I think it's the most advantageous move for me, but because I want to show kindness and generosity. In this moment, I trust that the other player will respond in kind and that our shared intention of building a connection will prevail.\n\nFinally, I will give  $10",
