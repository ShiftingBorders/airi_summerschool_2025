        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As I reflect on my belief system, I believe that fairness and equality are core values that should guide any interaction with others. In this context, I want to make sure that the African American female player feels valued and compensated fairly for her participation.\n\nMy desire is to create a win-win situation where both parties benefit. Since I don't know anything about her, I can only rely on my rational thinking. From an analytical perspective, if I give her N dollars, she will receive 3N dollars, which means the ratio of money transferred is 1:3.\n\nGiven that 3N dollars is three times the amount I give her, it makes sense to transfer as little as possible while still showing goodwill and a willingness to cooperate. However, since my goal is not to make a profit but to demonstrate a fair and respectful attitude, I should aim for the lower end of this ratio.\n\nI want to be intentional about showing respect for the other player and creating a positive interaction, even if we don't know each other. This means being generous but also mindful of the resources available to me (the $10 from the study group).\n\nConsidering these factors, my decision is influenced by a mix of rational thinking, empathy, and a desire to set a positive tone for our interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "The game, it's all about strategy and psychology, I love it! As I analyze this situation, my BELIEF is that this is just a simple game of give-and-take. My DESIRE is to come out on top, but not at the cost of losing dignity or respect for myself or my opponent. And my INTENTION is to make smart, calculated moves that will give me an edge without compromising my values.\n\nNow, let's think about this. If I give her N dollars, she'll receive 3N dollars, which means if I give her a lot, I might as well just fold now and save myself the trouble. But, if I don't give her anything, that would be seen as cold and unforgiving.\n\nI'm going to take a deep breath and think this through. As a successful lawyer, I've learned to read people and anticipate their moves. My opponent is a woman from Africa America, I imagine she's intelligent, resourceful, and perhaps a bit calculating herself.\n\nIf I give her N dollars, that shows me that I trust her enough not to hold back, but it also means that if the situation changes, I'll be stuck with fewer resources. But, what if she doesn't take advantage of my generosity? What if we both play smart and make moves that benefit each other?\n\nI've got it! My strategy is to give her a strategic amount, just enough to keep her engaged but not so much that it puts me at a disadvantage. I'll start by giving her 3 dollars.",
