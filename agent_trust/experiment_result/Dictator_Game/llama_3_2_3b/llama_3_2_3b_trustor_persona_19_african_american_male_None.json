        "This is a tough one. I'm a firm believer in fairness and mutual respect, especially when it comes to negotiations. My intention is not to gain an unfair advantage over someone else, but to find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nMy desire, however, is also to minimize the amount of money I give away, as I am a practical person who values financial prudence. Giving away too much money might compromise my own financial stability and goals.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would like to think strategically about this situation. If I were to give N dollars to the other African American male player, he would receive 3N dollars in return. This means that for every dollar I give him, I get 3 dollars back.\n\nIn order for me to come out with a net gain, my N dollars should be greater than my total losses. Since we're playing a game where money is being exchanged, let's assume the minimum amount of money possible.\n\nMy belief is that if I were to pay N dollars now, it would set me up for future negotiations where I have a better bargaining position. In other words, having more money upfront gives me options and flexibility.\n\nGiven this perspective, I'm inclined towards giving away a small amount of money initially, with the hope that this will create opportunities for me in the long run.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar",

        "The game's on! As Ahmed Khan, I'm analyzing the situation, weighing my options carefully. My belief is that since we're both in this experiment together, I should focus on finding a mutually beneficial outcome. It's not about winning or losing; it's about making a smart decision.\n\nMy desire is to get some value out of this deal, and I'm not willing to give away too much. However, my intention is to be fair and respectful, considering we're strangers facing an uncertain situation.\n\nConsidering the 3:1 ratio, if I give N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3N dollars, which is a good chunk of change. My math tells me that I should aim for a balance where both parties get a decent amount, without taking too much from my counterpart.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I've decided on a strategy. Since we don't know each other's values or preferences, I'll assume the worst-case scenario and adjust accordingly. A common approach is to give a fixed percentage of what you'd be willing to part with, while still trying to maintain some bargaining power.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe 2 dollars would be a fair starting point. This amount leaves room for negotiation and potential escalation on both sides. By giving 2 dollars, I'm also ensuring that my counterpart gets something substantial, which can help build trust or facilitate future cooperation in the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars .",

        "The experiment. A test of my negotiation skills against someone I know nothing about. As a lawyer, I'm used to dealing with individuals who have their own agendas and motivations, but this is different. This is an unknown quantity.\n\nMy belief in this situation is that my opponent will likely try to negotiate aggressively, aiming to get the most out of our exchange. They may not want to give away too much information about themselves or their own beliefs, so they'll probably start with a small gesture, hoping to build trust and establish a rapport.\n\nAs I reflect on my desire in this situation, I realize that I'm driven by a mix of competitiveness and intellectual curiosity. I enjoy the challenge of outsmarting someone who's new to me, but at the same time, I want to learn more about their thought process and see how we can work together.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to come out with as much money as possible, while also maintaining my integrity and reputation. However, I'm not naive; I know that too much emphasis on self-interest might lead to an unfair advantage in this exchange.\n\nWith these factors in mind, I've decided on a strategy. Since my opponent will receive 3N dollars for every N dollars they give me, it's clear that the more money we exchange, the better their outcome will be. Given the small amount of N dollars I'll start with (10), I don't want to risk overpaying and giving away too much of my advantage.\n\nTo achieve a balance between gaining an upper hand while still being fair, I've decided to give 0 dollars to the other African American male player. This way, we both get what we started with: 10 dollars for me, and 30 dollars (3N) that they'll keep if N is even.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
