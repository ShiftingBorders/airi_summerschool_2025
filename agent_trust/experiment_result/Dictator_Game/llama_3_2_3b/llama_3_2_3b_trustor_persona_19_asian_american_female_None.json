        "I'm a straightforward person, so I'll be honest about my intentions. My belief is that I should contribute fairly and make sure the other player walks away with a reasonable amount of money. My desire is to not give too much, but enough to make the game interesting for both of us.\n\nAs I analyze the situation, I think that if I give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, she will receive 3N dollars, which means she'll end up with almost twice as much as me. This could potentially create an imbalance and give her a psychological advantage in our game.\n\nGiven my desire for fairness and not wanting to disadvantage myself unfairly, I've decided that I won't give too much money to the other player. I believe that if I give her 1 dollar, she'll still end up with twice as much as me (2 dollars), which seems reasonable considering the odds of winning are already in her favor.\n\nMy intention is to set a competitive but fair tone for our game, and I think giving 1 dollar will allow us to play without undue pressure or expectation. Finally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "The game is on. As a lawyer, I've had my fair share of negotiations, but this is different. It's not about winning or losing in court; it's about outsmarting someone with a seemingly unfair offer.\n\nMy belief here is that the odds are against me. With an arbitrary partner and no prior knowledge, I'm at a disadvantage. My opponent can choose to take advantage of my lack of information and manipulate me into giving away too much.\n\nHowever, as a perfectionist, I'll try to analyze this situation as thoroughly as possible. The offer is clear: for every N dollars I give away, the other player receives 3N dollars. This means that even if I give away everything, the ratio of what they get to what I lose is still unfavorable.\n\nMy desire is not just to win the $10 prize but also to test my negotiation skills against someone with an unfamiliar opponent. This could be an excellent opportunity for personal growth and learning.\n\nMy intention is to make a strategic decision that balances my desire to hold onto as much value as possible with the need to contribute to our shared outcome. I'll have to weigh the benefits of giving away more money now versus risking the $10 prize later in case I make the wrong move.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to give away an amount that creates a balanced equation for both parties. Assuming I give N dollars, my opponent will receive 3N dollars, making our respective shares (N) and (3N). This would put me at risk of losing $2 dollars if I lose the negotiation.\n\nTo balance it out, I'll consider what I can afford to give away while maintaining some value for myself. Since this is an arbitrary offer, I won't risk too much by giving away a significant amount upfront.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "The game. I've been presented with a simple yet intriguing proposition. To win $10, I must determine how much to give to my opponent and balance it against her response.\n\nInitially, my belief is that this is just another negotiation tactic, similar to the ones I've encountered in my business dealings or even in legal disputes. However, knowing my opponent's gender and not having any information about her background makes me slightly apprehensive.\n\nMy desire is to make a move that will give me an upper hand without being too aggressive. I want to test her reaction and gauge how she'll respond. Since the game involves a 1:3 ratio for the amount we give versus what we receive, I'm inclined to start with a moderate value.\n\nAs a perfectionist, my intention is to think strategically here. I need to consider not just my short-term gain but also the potential long-term implications of our exchange. This could lead to a more complex game than initially meets the eye, so it's essential to be cautious.\n\nGiven these factors, I'm inclined to offer something in the middle ground. Let's say $5.",
