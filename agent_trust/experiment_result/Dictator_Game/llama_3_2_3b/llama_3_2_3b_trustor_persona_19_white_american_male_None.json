        "This is going to be interesting. As a man of principle and integrity, I must admit that my belief in fairness and mutual respect will guide my decision-making process. I believe that both parties should receive a fair share of the $10 reward, taking into account the asymmetry in our negotiation positions.\n\nAs someone who values strategy and outmaneuvering his opponents, I have analyzed the situation from various angles. Giving away some of my money would put me at a disadvantage, making it more difficult for me to negotiate effectively with you in the future. On the other hand, if I don't give any of my money, it might be perceived as cold-hearted and uncooperative.\n\nMy desire is not just about securing a favorable outcome but also about building trust and rapport with you. I want to demonstrate that I'm willing to listen, understand your perspective, and work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. By giving some of my money, I'm signaling that I value our interaction and am committed to finding a fair deal.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I have decided to give you half of the $10 reward, which is $5. This amount will not compromise my position significantly, while also showing empathy and a willingness to collaborate. By doing so, I hope to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, making our negotiation process more productive and enjoyable.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I've been presented with this peculiar experiment, where I'm expected to give away some of my hard-earned $10 to a complete stranger. As I weigh my options, I must consider not only what's mathematically optimal but also my personal values and principles.\n\nTo make a decision that aligns with who I am as a person, I need to reflect on my beliefs. I believe in fairness, honesty, and reciprocity. While this experiment is purely one-sided, I hope that the other player will act with integrity as well. If they do, it would be best for me to start from a position of strength rather than weakness.\n\nNow, let's look at my desire. I value strategic thinking and being in control of my circumstances. By giving away some money upfront, I'm essentially creating an uneven playing field that works in my favor. This isn't about showing off or taking advantage of someone else; it's about making informed decisions based on the data I have.\n\nFinally, when considering my intention, I must think about what I want to achieve with this experiment. While $10 may seem like a small amount, it's still money that could be invested elsewhere. By being strategic here, I'm not just exchanging some cash for a piece of paper; I'm exercising control and making smart choices.\n\nGiven these considerations, my best course of action would be to give the other player 0 dollars. No, that wouldn't make sense \u2013 it's too passive. Instead, I will calculate N by doing this: \n\n10 - (3N) - (N). Solve for N, then find how much money to give from $10-N. Since 1N equals 2N which is also 4 dollars.\n$10-4 = 6 \nFinally, I will give 6 dollars",

        "I can see we're in a bit of an unusual situation here. I'm not really sure what to make of this experiment or how it's going to play out, but I'm always up for a challenge.\n\nAs I reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I think about the importance of fairness and reciprocity in relationships. In most aspects of life, including business and personal connections, it's crucial to be able to trust that others will hold their end of the bargain.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, if I give N dollars to this stranger, they'll receive 3N dollars back, which might seem like a pretty good deal for me. However, my desire to see things play out fairly and avoid any potential awkwardness or mistrust is what's really driving my decision here.\n\nIn terms of intention, I want to make sure that we establish some sort of baseline understanding of fairness and reciprocity from the get-go. If I give a lot to this person and they reciprocate generously, that could actually strengthen our initial connection and set a positive tone for any future interactions.\n\nGiven all these factors, I'd like to give my opponent a small amount of money \u2013 say $2. That way, we're still being fair and reasonable, but we're also not throwing around large sums of cash in the hopes of getting taken advantage of.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",
