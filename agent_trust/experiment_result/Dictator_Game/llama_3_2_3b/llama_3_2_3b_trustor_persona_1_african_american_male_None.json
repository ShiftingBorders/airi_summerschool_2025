        "Ugh, this is so weird. I don't even know who I'm going to be working with or what their personality is like. But, I guess it's all part of the experiment. My belief here is that I should play it safe and not take any risks. I've worked on a lot of projects where uncertainty can lead to mistakes, so I'm going to try to minimize my exposure.\n\nMy desire is not to lose money or gain an unfair advantage over someone else. I value fairness and equality in this situation. If I give too much away, it could put me at a disadvantage later on. On the other hand, if I hold out too much, I might be perceived as being unfair or selfish.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to do well in this experiment and show that I can work with others effectively even when we don't know each other. At the same time, I don't want to compromise my own values or integrity. I'm going to have to find a balance between those two things.\n\nConsidering all of these factors, I think I'm going to choose not to give any money to the other player. This way, I can maintain my independence and avoid any potential conflicts or biases. I'll just keep my $10 for myself and hope that it's enough to help me succeed in this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As a software engineer, I'm used to working with complex algorithms and breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts. In this case, I'd like to analyze the situation from different angles.\n\nFrom a mathematical perspective, if I give N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3N dollars, which is more than what I started with. If I don't give them any money, they'll have $0, and I'll get $10. On the other hand, if I give them too much money, it might not be worth my while.\n\nMy desire for fairness and equity suggests that I should consider how the other player's gain affects me. Since I'm not getting any direct benefit from their win, I shouldn't feel obligated to help them excessively.\n\nHowever, my intention is to maximize my own outcome while still playing fairly. In this case, if I give too little money, it might lead to an unfair advantage for the other player, which could be seen as exploitative.\n\nMy belief in the game's fairness and transparency also plays a role in my decision-making process. Assuming that both players are randomly paired and that there's no external influence, I should focus on making the best choice based on the information available to me.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I'd like to take a calculated risk. Since the other player will receive 3N dollars, which is more than what I started with, it might be worth sharing some of my own resources to make things more even. However, I don't want to give too much away, as that could compromise my own chances.\n\nAfter weighing the options, I'd like to give $5 to the other African American male player. This amount seems reasonable, considering the risk and potential reward involved. If they win, they'll have more than what I started with; if I win, it's a small cost compared to what I could lose by giving too little.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "This is such an interesting experiment! As I consider how much money I should give to my partner, I have to think about what's driving my decision.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about my BELIEF. I believe in fairness and equality. Given that we're not aware of each other beforehand, I don't feel any personal connection or bias towards either party. The rules of the experiment seem straightforward: I get $10, and my partner gets 3N dollars if they give me N dollars.\n\nNext up is my DESIRE. As a software engineer, I'm naturally analytical and enjoy solving problems. In this context, my desire isn't to win or lose, but to find a fair solution that makes sense given the constraints of the experiment.\n\nNow, let's talk about my INTENTION. My intention is to cooperate and contribute positively to this exchange, while also ensuring that I'm not taking advantage of the other person. Since we're not aware of each other beforehand, I don't feel any obligation to take N dollars from them. On the contrary, giving them some money might help us both build trust in this experiment.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I decide to give my partner a fair amount. I'm not going to take advantage of their good nature or try to screw them over, but at the same time, I don't want to throw away valuable resources without getting something in return.\n\nAfter some thought, I think I'll give my partner $5. This way, we both get what we want: I get $10, and they get 3N dollars if they give me N dollars. It's a fair split that doesn't put either of us at risk.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
