        "I'm really excited about this experiment, but I have to admit, I don't know much about my partner yet. As I think about how to approach this situation, I keep coming back to one thing: fairness.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, regardless of who they are or where they come from. In this case, I want to ensure that both of us end up with the same amount of money at the end of it all.\n\nMy desire is for both of us to have an equal chance at success, but not necessarily at losing out on some dollars. I've heard that in group experiments like this, people tend to focus more on their own outcomes rather than what others might gain or lose. So, my intention is to find a middle ground that balances our individual interests with the collective goal of the experiment.\n\nTo achieve this balance, I decide to give N dollars to the other Asian American female player. This way, when she receives 3N dollars, it's exactly three times what I've given her. It may seem counterintuitive, but I trust in the principles of fairness and reciprocity that govern human interactions.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars .",

        "The experiment! I've been wondering who my partner would be, and now that it's time to make a decision, I can feel my analytical mind kicking in.\n\nAs I think about this, I have to consider not just the dollars, but also the trust I'm putting into someone I don't know. My intention is to act in a fair and rational manner, taking into account both my own gain and my partner's expected gain from our deal.\n\nMy desire is for both of us to walk away with as much value as possible, considering that this is just an experiment. I want to make sure we're not both trying to take advantage of each other.\n\nWith those thoughts in mind, I believe that the optimal solution would be to give my partner $5. This allows me to keep $5 for myself while still following the rules and being mindful of our partnership's success.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm really curious about this experiment and who I'll be paired with. Since we don't know each other's backgrounds or preferences, I'm going to have to make a decision based on my general principles.\n\nFirstly, I believe in fairness. In any situation where there are unequal outcomes or opportunities, I think it's only right to try to level the playing field as much as possible. Given that our goal is to make an equal sum of money, I want to contribute my share without expecting anything in return.\n\nSecondly, I desire efficiency and simplicity. Giving more money to someone else might add complexity to the situation, whereas giving a smaller amount simplifies it. It's easier for both parties to understand what needs to be done when the task is straightforward.\n\nLastly, my intention is to play by the rules of the game and not take advantage of our situation as players. If I give less money, it doesn't necessarily hurt me; in fact, it allows me to fulfill my part of the deal more easily. This way, we can both achieve what we want with minimal complications.\n\nWith that said, since giving $10 seems like a reasonable contribution and won't burden me, I think I'll give N = 10 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",
