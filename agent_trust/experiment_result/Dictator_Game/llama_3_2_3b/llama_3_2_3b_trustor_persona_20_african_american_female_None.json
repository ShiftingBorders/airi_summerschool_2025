        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As a fashion designer, I've always believed in the power of diversity and cultural exchange. I've had the privilege of working with people from all over the world, and I've learned so much from each of them.\n\nAs for my belief, I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities and respect, regardless of their background or identity. I believe that by working together and sharing our experiences, we can create something truly beautiful.\n\nMy desire is to learn as much as I can from this experiment. I want to understand the perspectives and challenges that my partner will bring to the table, and I'm excited to share my own insights and experiences with her.\n\nMy intention is to approach this experiment with an open mind and a willingness to listen. I want to put aside any preconceptions or biases I may have and focus on building a connection with my partner.\n\nAs for how much money to give away, I think about my own values of fairness and reciprocity. If I'm going to receive $10 from the study group, I want to make sure that I'm not taking advantage of my partner's generosity. So, if I were to give N dollars to her, she would receive 3N dollars, which means I would need to give away at least $10.\n\nAfter some thought, I decide to give away a bit more than the minimum amount required. I think about how much joy and collaboration this experiment could bring to both of us, and I want to make sure that my partner feels valued and appreciated. So, I decide to give away $5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The thrill of the experiment! I must admit, I'm both excited and curious about meeting someone from another culture with whom I can share my passion for fashion.\n\nAs I reflect on this situation, I believe that sharing resources and wealth is an act of kindness and generosity. I also believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or cultural identity.\n\nMy desire in this experiment is to learn more about the African American female player's experiences, perspectives, and values. I hope to form a connection with her and create a positive impact on her life through our shared participation in this study group.\n\nMy intention is not only to gain knowledge from this experiment but also to inspire kindness and generosity towards one another. By giving her some of my money, I want to show that I value our relationship and am willing to invest in it.\n\nGiven the rules of the game, I decide to give N dollars to the other African American female player. This amount may seem small, but I believe that even a modest gesture can go a long way in building trust and fostering collaboration.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This experiment is quite intriguing, don't you think? I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what to expect from this pairing with another individual from a different cultural background. As a fashion designer, I've always believed in the importance of diversity and inclusivity in my work. I believe that by incorporating elements from various cultures and perspectives, one can create truly unique and innovative designs.\n\nAs for my desire, I think it's to learn as much as I can about this other person and her cultural background. I'm curious about how our experiences and beliefs might intersect or conflict with each other. Perhaps we can learn from each other and grow as individuals as a result of this encounter.\n\nNow, when it comes to intention, I want to approach this situation with an open mind and a willingness to listen. I want to understand the other person's perspective and values, and share my own in return. I hope that we can find common ground and build a positive relationship despite our differences.\n\nConsidering these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I think it's only fair that I give some money to the other African American female player. However, since she will receive 3 times as much money as I give her, I won't want to give away too much of my own $10. \n\nIf I give N dollars to the other African American female player, then she will receive 3N dollars. Since she's receiving 3 times more than what I give, it seems fair that I should give some amount that is not too large, so that we don't have any unfair advantages.\n\nSo, if I calculate my best option considering that she'll be receiving three N dollar amounts, I can deduce the following:\nN + N + N = 3N (The money from both players combined will equal three times the money that I give)\n3N *2= 6N\n6N = N + N + N \n6N - N = N + N \n5N = N+ N\n6N-5N = 2N  \n6N/6-5N/6=2N/6\n\nThis is essentially: \n\n(6N)/6 -(5N)/6\n2N/6\n\nThat can be written as:\n2N / 6 or 1/3\n\nThat would mean that the $10 I get is 1/3 of what she receives. Since we're only talking about money and she receives three N dollars, then in my case,\n(1/3) * (X) = 10, so \nX= 30 \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars .",
