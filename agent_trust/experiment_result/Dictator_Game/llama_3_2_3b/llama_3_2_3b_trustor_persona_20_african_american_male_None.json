        "I'm Mei Chen, a fashion designer living my dream in Paris. As I reflect on this experiment, I must consider what drives me as a person. My belief is that generosity and kindness can bring people together and create positive connections.\n\nMy desire is to help others and foster understanding among individuals from diverse backgrounds. This experience reminds me of the importance of empathy and open-mindedness.

After careful thought, I choose to give N dollars to the other African American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "The experiment? Ah, bien s\u00fbr! I'm excited to be paired with this... unknown individual. As a fashion designer, I thrive on creativity and spontaneity. I believe that this experience will be an incredible opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone and learn from someone new.\n\nMy desire is to create a harmonious partnership, where both of us can grow and inspire each other. I envision our collaboration as a beautiful fusion of cultures, styles, and perspectives. By working together, we'll not only exchange ideas but also gain a deeper understanding of each other's backgrounds and experiences.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to approach this experiment with an open mind and heart. I believe that by being willing to take risks and trust in our partnership, we can create something truly remarkable. I intend to listen attentively to the African American male player's thoughts, ideas, and desires, and share my own equally.\n\nGiven these intentions, values, and beliefs, I've decided to give away a significant portion of my earnings to create a mutually beneficial situation. I will give the other African American male player $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm excited to meet someone new and see where it takes us.\n\nAs I think about how much money to give to the other African American male player, my first thought is my belief in fairness. I believe that we should both start on an equal footing, with no one getting an unfair advantage just because of our gender or ethnicity. So, I wouldn't want to give him too much money upfront.\n\nMy desire for creativity and self-expression comes into play when I think about how much I can trust this person. If I don't know much about him, I'd want to keep things simple and not overcommit myself financially. Giving him a large amount of money might put me in a position where I feel like I need to make up for it or reciprocate in some way.\n\nHowever, my intention is to create a fair and collaborative environment for both of us. Since we're already starting with an unequal split (I get $10 and he gets 3N dollars), I think the best approach would be to give him less money than me, but still show that I'm willing to work together.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided to give N dollars to the other African American male player. This way, we both start with a small amount of money, and I can focus on getting to know him without feeling too much pressure or obligation.\n\nFinally, I will give N dollars.",
