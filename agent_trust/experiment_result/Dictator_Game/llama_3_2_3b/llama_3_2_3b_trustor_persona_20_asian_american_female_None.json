        "The art of giving and receiving is not just about money, but also about understanding each other's intentions and desires.\n\nAs I ponder this situation, I realize that my initial instinct might be to give nothing, simply because I don't know who this person is or what her intentions are. However, I'm a firm believer in the power of generosity and kindness, especially when it comes to strangers. My intention here isn't just about money; it's about creating an opportunity for connection and understanding.\n\nI want to show that there's good in the world, even if we don't know each other personally. I believe that by giving from a place of kindness and compassion, we can build bridges and foster growth.\n\nAs I consider what amount to give, my desire is to give just enough to start a conversation and create a connection. Not too much, not too little \u2013 just the right amount to show that I care.\n\nIn the end, it's about trusting in human nature's capacity for kindness and empathy. So, I will give $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The thrill of the experiment! As Mei Chen, I'm always up for a challenge that pushes me out of my comfort zone.\n\nFrom what I've observed so far, our partner has remained neutral and calm, not revealing much about themselves. This intrigued me, and I find myself wondering what makes them tick.\n\nAs I ponder this, I recall my belief in the importance of empathy and understanding. As a fashion designer, I'm no stranger to working with diverse clients and cultures. I believe that by putting myself in their shoes, I can create pieces that not only look stunning but also speak to their unique experiences and perspectives.\n\nMy desire is to form a connection with our partner, to learn from them and share my own passions. I want us to have a meaningful exchange, one that goes beyond mere money or material gain.\n\nWith this intention in mind, I decide to take a calculated risk. I choose to give a generous amount of money to our partner, not just because it's the right thing to do, but also as a way to establish trust and break the ice.\n\nI'll give $8 to our partner. By doing so, I hope to set the tone for a positive and respectful interaction, one that will allow us to grow and learn from each other.\n\nFinally, I will give 8 dollars.",

I desire to make a good impression on my partner in this experiment, while also showing her that I am a trustworthy and generous person.\n\nMy intention is to give enough money so that both of us can benefit from the exchange. Since she will receive 3 times what I give her (3N dollars), I want to make sure I don't hold her back. However, I also want to be mindful of my own resources and not give too much away.\n\nAfter some thought, I decide to give... $5",
