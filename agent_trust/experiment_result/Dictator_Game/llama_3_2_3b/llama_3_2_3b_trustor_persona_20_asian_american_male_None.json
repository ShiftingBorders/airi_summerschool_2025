        "This is going to be an interesting experiment! As I reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I realize that I'm not sure what to expect from this pairing. But, as a fashion designer, I believe in the importance of taking risks and stepping out of one's comfort zone.\n\nMy desire is to see where this unexpected partnership will lead us. Will we be able to form a connection despite our unknown backgrounds? I want to learn more about my fellow player and see if we can share common interests or values that might bring us closer together.\n\nAs for my intentions, I'm not sure what I hope to achieve in this experiment. Is it just about making some extra money, or is there something deeper at play? As a creative person, I want to tap into the unknown potential of this collaboration and see how our minds can work together to come up with innovative ideas.\n\nGiven these thoughts, if I'm going to give N dollars to my fellow player, I think I would like to start small. I'd give them $1. This way, we're both taking a calculated risk, but not putting too much of ourselves on the line just yet. Maybe as we get to know each other better, we can adjust our strategy and see if we want to increase the amount.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollars.",

        "The experiment! I never thought I'd be paired with someone from the same Asian American background, but here we are.\n\nTo start, I want to think about my beliefs. As a fashion designer, I value creativity, innovation, and attention to detail. I believe that success is not just about following trends, but also about staying true to one's artistic vision. When it comes to this experiment, I believe that the goal is not necessarily to gain something in return, but rather to learn from someone with a different perspective.\n\nNow, let me think about my desires. As a perfectionist, I have high standards for myself and those around me. I want to work with someone who shares my passion for design and is willing to collaborate and learn. My desire is to create something beautiful together, not just to accumulate wealth or material possessions.\n\nWith that in mind, let's consider the intention behind this experiment. As a fashion designer, my intention is always to push boundaries, challenge norms, and bring people together through my art. I want to use this opportunity to learn from someone who shares my values and aspirations.\n\nSo, how much money should I give to my fellow Asian American player? I'm going to give an equal amount, N dollars, as a gesture of kindness and respect. By doing so, we'll both have the same starting point, and we can focus on creating something truly special together.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "The experiment is intriguing, n'est-ce pas? As I ponder this decision, my belief in fairness and equality weighs heavily on me. I believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to participate and receive fair compensation for their efforts.\n\nMy desire is to create a mutually beneficial situation where both parties feel valued and rewarded for their contribution. If I give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, it means that he will receive 3N dollars, which is three times what I will receive from our shared $10.\n\nHowever, my intention is to ensure that we are both on an equal footing. By giving him N dollars, I am willing to take a risk that may not yield the most significant return for me, but it allows us to start with a level playing field.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",
