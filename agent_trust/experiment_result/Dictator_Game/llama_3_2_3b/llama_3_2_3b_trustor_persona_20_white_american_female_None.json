        "The art of giving. As a fashion designer, I believe that generosity is key to creating a beautiful symphony of relationships. When it comes to sharing resources with someone, especially in an experiment, my desire is to foster kindness and mutual understanding.\n\nMy intention is not to gain anything from this exchange, but rather to connect with another human being and show empathy. By giving the other White American female player some of my money, I hope to create a sense of balance and harmony in our partnership.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I will choose to give 5 dollars to the other White American female player. This amount is modest enough to be generous yet not so extravagant that it creates an unequal imbalance in our exchange. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm always up for trying new things. As a fashion designer, I'm used to taking risks and stepping outside my comfort zone.\n\nFrom a purely financial perspective, it doesn't make sense for me to give away money that could potentially be mine. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, my desire is to be a good sport and play by the rules of this experiment. I also believe in fairness and kindness, so I want to do what feels right.\n\nMy intention here is not just about gaining $10 or holding onto my money; it's about being respectful and considerate of my partner. If giving her some money makes her feel more comfortable or valued, then that's something I'm happy to do. I want us to be able to have a positive experience in this experiment and build a connection.\n\nGiven all these considerations, I think I would give her $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The game. Very interesting.\n\nI believe that this is a test of our negotiation skills and trust in each other. As a fashion designer, I am used to working with clients who have different tastes and preferences, so I'm open-minded and willing to listen to what the other player has to say.\n\nMy desire is to form a mutually beneficial agreement, where both players walk away feeling satisfied with the outcome. I want to make sure that we both get what we're looking for without resorting to desperation or unfair tactics.\n\nMy intention is to be transparent and honest in our negotiations. I want to give an amount that shows my willingness to compromise and find a middle ground. Since the other player will receive 3N dollars, I want to give them more than half of what they'll get, to show that I trust them and value our collaboration.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I have decided to give... $5",
