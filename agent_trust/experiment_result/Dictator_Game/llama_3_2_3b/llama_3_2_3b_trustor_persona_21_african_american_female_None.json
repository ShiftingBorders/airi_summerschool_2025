        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment. I've never been one for sudden, unfamiliar interactions with people, especially when it comes to money. As I reflect on my personality, I'd say I'm an introvert who values my independence and personal space.\n\nGiven that, I don't have a strong desire to gain much financial reward in this situation, as the experiment is purely for my benefit. However, at the same time, I do want to be seen as fair and considerate of others. My intention here would be to find a balance between these two perspectives.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if I were to receive $10 from the study group, I wouldn't want the other player to take advantage of me in return for a much higher sum. On the other hand, if I were to give them very little, they might feel taken advantage of as well.\n\nTaking all this into account, my belief is that $5 seems like a reasonable amount to give to the other African American female player. It shows that I'm willing to share and be generous, while also not compromising too much in terms of fairness. My desire to build trust and maintain a positive dynamic with my partner also plays a role here.\n\nIn conclusion, as someone who values intelligence, ambition, and attention to detail, but is also aware of the importance of being considerate of others, I believe giving $5 seems like a good starting point. Finally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to participate. Since I don't know who the other player is, I'll make a decision based on my own beliefs and values.\n\nIn my belief system, fairness and equality are important principles that guide my interactions with others. Given that we're paired randomly without any prior knowledge of each other's backgrounds or perspectives, I want to ensure that we both have an equal opportunity to succeed in this experiment.\n\nMy desire is to help create a level playing field for everyone involved, regardless of our differences. By giving the same amount of money to the other player as I receive, we can start on a neutral footing and see how things play out.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to set a positive precedent for our interaction by showing respect and empathy towards someone who may come from a different background or experience. I believe that this gesture of generosity will allow us to establish trust and work together more effectively in the experiment.\n\nGiven these considerations, I've decided to give $5 to the other African American female player as a gesture of kindness and solidarity",

        "I think about this for a moment, considering my options carefully. I want to make sure I'm making the right decision based on my own values and principles.\n\nAs I reflect on my belief system, I realize that I value fairness and equality. Given that we're paired randomly and don't know each other's backgrounds or circumstances, I believe it's essential to treat the other player with respect and kindness.\n\nMy desire is to be seen as a fair and compassionate person, even in a situation where we're strangers. I want to show that I can put aside any initial biases or assumptions and make a decision based on what feels right for both of us.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I consider the fact that if I give N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3N dollars in return. This means that I'm essentially trading some of my own money for a potentially greater reward. However, I also recognize that the game is entirely random and unpredictable, and there's no guarantee that I'll end up with more or less than the other player.\n\nUltimately, my intention is to be honest and transparent in my decision-making process. I want to choose an amount that feels right for me, rather than trying to game the system or manipulate the outcome.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to give a moderate amount of money to the other player. Given that we're strangers and don't know each other's circumstances, I don't want to take advantage of their trust or try to get ahead at someone else's expense. At the same time, I do want to acknowledge that our pairing is a random event, and there's no guarantee of success.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
