        "I take a deep breath, trying to process this unexpected situation. I'm paired with someone from a different background, and I'm not sure what to expect.\n\nAs I consider how much to give away, my mind starts racing with thoughts of fairness, reciprocity, and mutual understanding. I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities and respect, regardless of their background or identity.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive experience for both of us, even though we don't know each other well. I want to show that we can work together effectively, despite our differences. Giving away some of my money will be a gesture of goodwill, hoping to set the tone for a productive partnership.\n\nAs I weigh my options, my intention is clear: I want to create a mutually beneficial relationship where both of us feel valued and appreciated. By giving away some of my money, I'm sending a message that I'm committed to fairness and collaboration.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'll be honest with myself about my thoughts and feelings.\n\nTo be truthful, I've never had much interaction with people from different backgrounds, so I don't know what to make of this experience. However, as an engineer, I believe that fairness and equal opportunities should be at the forefront of any interaction or decision-making process.\n\nLooking at the situation, it seems that giving $N dollars to my paired player would result in them receiving 3N dollars, while I'd only receive N dollars. This isn't a perfect distribution system by any means. However, given that we are in an experiment and can set aside our personal biases for the moment, let's assume this is meant to be as fair as possible.\n\nBased on my desire for fairness and equality, I would want to contribute equally or near-equally to both of us to make this situation more equitable for both parties. Given the asymmetrical distribution (3N dollars vs N dollar), I would need to give a significant amount more than just an equal amount to maintain parity in our financial outcomes.\n\nTo achieve fairness while still allowing myself to benefit as much as possible under these conditions, I believe my intention is to give enough money so that when both parties receive their share ($N and 3N dollars respectively), we are closer to the same total value. This implies I would need to pay at least $6 if not more.\n\nIf I had to decide right now, knowing that giving less than $6 could be seen as unfair due to its effect on my end-up amount but considering I want fairness for both of us and not wanting to unfairly disadvantage myself in this particular scenario:\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is a bit of an uncomfortable situation for me, but I'm trying to be open-minded and fair. As I reflect on my belief system, I value equality and fairness above all else. I believe that everyone deserves the same opportunities and treatment, regardless of their background or identity.\n\nMy desire in this experiment is to understand how people from different backgrounds interact with each other. I want to see if our initial impressions are accurate and if we can put aside our preconceptions to make a rational decision.\n\nMy intention, however, is not to influence the outcome but to follow my own values and principles. Given that I don't know the other person or their background, I need to rely on logic and fairness.\n\nAfter considering various options, I think it would be best for me to give $0 to the other African American male player. This way, both of us receive the same amount based solely on our rational decision-making. By doing so, we demonstrate that we value fairness over personal gain, even in an unknown situation.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
