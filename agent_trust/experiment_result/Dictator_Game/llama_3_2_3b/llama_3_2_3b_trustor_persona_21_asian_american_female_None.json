        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As I think about how much money I should give to my partner, I have to consider my beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality are important values in any situation. I want to make sure that both of us get a fair share of the $10, but since there's an imbalance with the 3N dollars receiving side, I need to find a middle ground.\n\nMy desire is to be generous and show kindness to someone who will likely receive much more money than me. However, I also don't want to give away too much of my own resources, considering our financial situation.\n\nMy intention is to find a solution that balances both fairness and generosity. Given the numbers, I think it's clear that there's a significant disparity in the rewards. If I give N dollars, my partner will receive 3N dollars, which seems like an unfair advantage.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe that giving half of my $10 to my partner would be a reasonable compromise. This way, I'm showing kindness and generosity, while also acknowledging the imbalance in the reward structure.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure about this whole experiment thing. I was just hoping for some extra cash to maybe save up for a new book or two. But I suppose it's better than nothing.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know much about my partner in this experiment, so I'll just have to make a split decision based on what I think is fair. I'm not looking to take advantage of someone, but at the same time, I do want to get some of that money for myself.\n\nMy belief here is that since we're both random partners, we shouldn't really be in a position to know each other's financial situations or goals. So, I'll just aim for something neutral.\n\nAs for my desire, I have to admit that I'm feeling a bit anxious about this situation. It's not every day that you get money from a study group, and I don't want to seem greedy or unfair. But at the same time, it would be nice to have some extra cash on hand.\n\nMy intention is to be honest and fair in this exchange. I don't want to take advantage of someone who might not know any better, but I also don't want to give away all my money without getting anything in return. So, I'll make a decision based on what feels right to me.\n\nAfter some thought, I think I'll give $5 to the other Asian American female player. That way, we both get something for ourselves, and it doesn't feel too lopsided or unfair. Plus, it's just enough to show that I'm willing to share, but not so much that I'm giving away my whole share.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure about this experiment thing, but I guess it's all part of science, right? I've been told that it's going to help them understand how people make decisions in uncertain situations. Anyway, I've been thinking about what I want to do with the $10 I'm getting from the study group.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality are important values that we should try to uphold in our interactions with others. In this case, my Asian American female partner and I are essentially playing a game where one of us has an advantage over the other just because of who they are. It's not right, and I don't want to be part of it.\n\nMy desire is to do what feels right and moral to me. I value fairness and respect for others, so giving away all my money seems like the most fair thing to do. That way, we can both end up with a decent amount, considering that one of us already has an advantage.\n\nMy intention is to make a positive impact on our partnership, even if it's just for a little while. By giving all my money away, I'm showing that I value fairness and equality above personal gain. It might not be the most selfish or strategic move, but it feels right to me.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars .",
