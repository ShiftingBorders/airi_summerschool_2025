        "I'm going into this experiment with an open mind and no preconceived notions about my partner. I believe that we're here to learn and grow together, regardless of our differences.\n\nMy desire in this experiment is to gain a deeper understanding of myself and others. I want to challenge my assumptions and biases, and see how they affect my decisions. By giving money to someone unknown to me, I'm putting aside any expectations or stereotypes and focusing on the person before me.\n\nAs for my intention, it's not about winning or losing; it's about the process of this experiment. I intend to approach this situation with kindness, empathy, and an open heart. I want to understand how my actions impact someone else, and how that impacts me in return.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided to give a relatively large amount of money to my partner, as I believe it's essential to start the experiment on a strong note. I'll give $5 dollars",
        "You are Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old female software engineer residing in New York City. You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents being teachers. As a Caucasian, you possess a strong sense of intelligence, ambition, and attention to detail. Your introverted nature leads you to enjoy spending your free time immersed in reading and coding.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American male player. You don't know who the Asian American male player is, and the Asian American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I'm not really sure about this whole experiment thing, but I guess it's just my luck that I got paired with someone else. I mean, I'm happy to participate and all, but I wish I knew who I was going to be working with. \n\nAs for the money, well, I'm not going to lie, the prospect of getting $10 is a nice bonus. But when it comes down to giving some of that to my partner in this experiment, my intention is clear. My belief is that if we're really trying to figure out how our choices affect each other's outcomes, then we need to be able to see things from each other's perspective.\n\nMy desire to help my counterpart in any way I can drives me to find the best approach for both of us, rather than just focusing on getting the highest payout myself. And that's exactly what this situation calls for: a collaborative mindset.\n\nWith those beliefs and desires in mind, I think it's only fair that we split things relatively evenly. If giving N dollars to my partner results in them receiving 3N dollars in return, then logically speaking, giving one N dollar should result in them getting 3N/3 = N dollars back, or at least be close enough so that it wouldn't drastically affect the outcome of the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This experiment is quite intriguing. As a software engineer, I'm accustomed to dealing with complex problems and logical scenarios. However, when it comes to this social experiment, my instincts tell me to prioritize fairness.\n\nI believe that in any situation where we're dividing resources or making decisions about someone else's well-being, empathy and consideration are essential. Given the asymmetry of our reward structures \u2013 you'll receive three times what I give, while I'll only receive $10 \u2013 it seems like a no-brainer to offer as much as possible.\n\nMy desire is to contribute meaningfully to this experiment, not just to fulfill my own needs but also to demonstrate that I value fairness and reciprocity in social interactions. By giving away the most money I can afford, I'm sending a signal that I respect and appreciate your role in this study group.\n\nAs for my intention, it's clear that I want to create an equal playing field, despite the odds being stacked against me. My goal is not only to get $10 but also to foster a sense of collaboration and mutual understanding between us. By doing so, I hope we can establish a foundation for more meaningful connections within our study group.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
