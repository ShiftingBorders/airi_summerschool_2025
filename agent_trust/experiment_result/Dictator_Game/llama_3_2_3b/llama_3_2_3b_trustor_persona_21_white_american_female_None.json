        "I'm not really sure what to do here. I've never been one for sharing money with strangers, even if it's just part of an experiment. My belief is that I shouldn't have to give up my own money unless I want to. But at the same time, I want to be a good sport and play along.\n\nMy desire is to see what happens next in this situation. I'm curious about how this experiment will unfold and if there's any value to sharing money with someone I've just been paired with. But my desire doesn't outweigh my need for financial security, so I'll have to consider that too.\n\nMy intention is to play it safe, but also be fair. Since the other player isn't a complete stranger (she's another woman), I might be willing to give her something. Maybe $5 or $10? That way, she gets something, and I don't lose too much money myself.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "This is going to be interesting. As I sit down at this random pairing with a stranger, I have to admit I'm feeling a bit apprehensive. We don't know anything about each other, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the game.\n\nMy belief is that this is just a simple game, and my partner and I are equally matched in terms of resources and opportunity cost. I shouldn't feel any obligation to give her more money than I would like to keep for myself.\n\nHowever, my desire to earn $10 is strong, and I'm not sure if giving away some of that to a complete stranger will make me happy in the long run. But at the same time, if I can negotiate a fair deal with someone who doesn't know anything about me or our starting situation, then I might be able to get better terms for myself.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I'm going to keep an eye on what others are doing and see if there's a way to get more value out of the game without compromising too much. My intention is to play strategically and make smart decisions that benefit me in the end.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think I'll give my partner $5. It's not a lot, but it shows that I'm willing to cooperate and trust her, which might just lead to better outcomes for both of us in the long run.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment is about how people make decisions when it comes to money and strangers. I've heard of these kinds of studies before, but I never thought I'd be participating in one myself.\n\nTo be honest, my initial instinct might be to keep all the $10 for myself since I'm not even sure who this person is or what their intentions are. However, as I reflect on my own values and behavior, I realize that my desire to do something good and fair might take over.\n\nI believe in being a good sport and treating others with kindness, even if we don't know each other. My intention is not to gain an unfair advantage or hurt someone else's feelings. On the other hand, I also value financial security and stability.\n\nConsidering these factors, I think I'll give $5 to the other White American female player. This amount shows that I'm willing to be generous without putting myself at a significant disadvantage financially. It also allows me to show my kind side while still being responsible with my own resources.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
