        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As a software engineer, I've always been taught to approach problems with logic and reason, so I'll try to apply the same mindset to this situation.\n\nMy belief is that in order to maximize my own gain, I should give as little as possible to the other player while still following the rules of the game. However, since I do want to contribute to the overall success of our study group, I'm not completely opposed to giving a small amount.\n\nMy desire is to keep my own money safe and secure, but at the same time, I don't want to seem overly greedy or selfish. If I give too little, it might come across that way, which could potentially harm our working relationship.\n\nAs for my intention, I'm not really sure what I'm trying to achieve here. Is it just about maximizing my own gain, or is there something more to it? I suppose I'll have to observe the other player's behavior and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nTaking all of this into account, I think I'll choose a moderate amount to give. If I were to calculate it, I'd probably give around $5. That way, I'm giving enough to be seen as generous, but not so much that it puts me in a bad light.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure if I want to risk losing $10 by giving money to someone I don't know, but at the same time, I believe it's my intention to be cooperative and fair in this experiment. My desire is to gain new insights and knowledge from this experience, even if it means being vulnerable with a stranger.\n\nAs I consider my options, I want to make sure that I'm not giving too much money away, but not so little that the other player will feel taken advantage of. Given that they'll receive 3N dollars in return for N dollars, I think I'll aim to find a middle ground.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided to give $5 to the other White American male player. This way, we both come out with a decent amount, and I can still keep most of my initial $10. My intention is to be fair, cooperative, and open-minded in this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment. It sounds quite... intriguing. As I consider the options, my first thought is about fairness. If I'm only looking out for myself, I'd probably give nothing to the other player. But since we're both in this together, and there's no risk involved, it might be worth exploring the possibilities.\n\nMy belief is that the probability of each player getting a larger share or smaller share is equally likely. In essence, giving money away seems like a neutral act. My intuition tells me to keep my hands clean, so I'm hesitant to part with any dollars initially.\n\nHowever, I also consider the prospect of building trust and working together in this experiment. This could potentially be an excellent opportunity to collaborate and learn from someone else's perspective. In that case, I'd want to find a balance between giving enough to foster collaboration without giving too much away.\n\nMy desire is to make the most of this experience, both personally and professionally. If I can demonstrate my ability to cooperate with another person in a low-stakes situation, it could open up new doors for me in the future.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I believe that sharing some of my winnings could be beneficial for everyone involved. After weighing the options carefully, I've decided to give $5 to the other player. This amount seems like a reasonable compromise between giving enough to promote collaboration and not too much, so I can still keep my share intact.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
