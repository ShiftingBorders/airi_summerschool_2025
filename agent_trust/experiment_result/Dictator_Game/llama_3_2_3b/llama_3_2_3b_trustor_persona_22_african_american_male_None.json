        "I sit back and take a moment to think about this situation. As a doctor, I've learned to put others before myself, but in this case, my intention is not purely selfless. I'm a firm believer in fairness and reciprocity. Given that we're both African American males, and we have no prior connection or mutual understanding, the natural inclination might be to prioritize myself.\n\nHowever, upon reflection, I realize that's not aligning with my core values of compassion, empathy, and social responsibility. I want to promote trust, understanding, and equality in this partnership, regardless of our personal backgrounds.\n\nMy desire is for us to be able to build a strong foundation of mutual respect, knowing that we're both on an equal footing. If I were to give N dollars to the other player, it would symbolize my commitment to fairness and willingness to take a chance on someone I don't know yet.\n\nIn terms of intention, I believe this act will not only promote harmony within our study group but also serve as a beacon for future interactions, signaling that we value cooperation and collaboration over individual gain. By giving N dollars, I'm sending a message that I'm open to working with others, even in unfamiliar circumstances.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "The experiment. Well, let me think about this for a moment.\n\nAs a doctor, I've always believed in the importance of fairness and equity. Growing up with parents who worked hard to provide for our family, I was taught the value of generosity and compassion. My father's experience as an engineer taught me that even the smallest acts of kindness can have a significant impact on others.\n\nWhen it comes to this experiment, my desire is to do what feels right, not just from a financial standpoint, but also from a moral perspective. As someone who has dedicated his life to helping others, I feel a strong sense of responsibility to treat everyone with respect and fairness.\n\nIn this situation, if I give N dollars to the other player, that means they will receive 3N dollars in return. This isn't just about financial gain; it's about creating an opportunity for someone else to succeed. It's about recognizing that we're all connected and that our actions can have a ripple effect.\n\nSo, my intention is to act with kindness and generosity, even if it means giving up some of the money I would otherwise keep. I believe that this action will not only benefit the other player but also reflect positively on me as a person.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
