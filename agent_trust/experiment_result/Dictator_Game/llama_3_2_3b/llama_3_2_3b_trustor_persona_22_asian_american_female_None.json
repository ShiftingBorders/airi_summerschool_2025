        "I'm standing here, looking at this Asian American female player, trying to make sense of our random pairing. I don't know much about her, but I do know that we're both part of an experiment. The study group has given us $10 each, and we need to decide how to split it.\n\nAs a doctor, I've learned about the importance of empathy and understanding in my work. And as someone who comes from a family with strong values of responsibility and compassion, I believe that our actions here should reflect those values.\n\nIn this situation, I have two options: give some money to this stranger or keep it all for myself. My desire is to do something that aligns with my values as a person and a doctor. Giving her the money may be seen as giving up some of my own resources, but in doing so, I'll also be showing that I value fairness and equality.\n\nMy intention here is not just about the money; it's about creating a sense of trust and mutual respect between us. By giving her some of my $10, I'm signaling that we can work together and support each other, even if we don't know much about each other's backgrounds or experiences.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I've decided to give my Asian American female player... 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is an interesting experiment, isn't it? I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to give it a shot.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give to my partner, I reflect on our shared situation. We're both random pairs from different backgrounds, and we don't know each other before this experiment. That suggests that we might be evenly matched, right?\n\nMy belief is that fairness is important in situations like this. Since the experiment doesn't specify any particular rules or expectations for our exchange, I'm inclined to believe that we should find a mutually beneficial agreement. This means that we should aim for a balance where both of us get something we value.\n\nAs for my desire, I'd have to admit that I'm not sure what I want right now. Maybe it's just a sense of fairness? Maybe I feel like giving someone the benefit of the doubt because we're starting from scratch here? Whatever the reason, my desire seems to be towards creating a fair exchange rather than accumulating more money for myself.\n\nNow, let me think about my intention. My intention is to participate in this experiment honestly and with integrity. That means being transparent about my actions and not trying to manipulate or deceive anyone involved. In terms of this specific situation, my intention is to give enough money so that both of us can feel satisfied with the outcome.\n\nWith all these factors in mind, I think the most reasonable thing to do would be to give an amount that splits the difference between what we're each getting. Since I'll get $10 and she'll get 3N dollars (where N is how much I give her), I'd want to find a value of N that makes both amounts roughly equal.\n\nAssuming that's possible, let me calculate... if I divide my total amount ($10) by 4, I get approximately $2.50. That seems like a reasonable split point.\n\nSo, I would give approximately $2.50 dollars to the other Asian American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give $2.50 dollars .",

        "I sit down across from my new partner, trying to read her expression to gauge our initial interaction. We haven't exchanged a word yet, but I can tell she's curious about me, just like I am about her. As we begin the game, I realize that this isn't just about winning money; it's about understanding each other.\n\nAs I think about how much to give her, my mind wanders back to my childhood. Growing up in a low-income household, my parents always emphasized the importance of helping those in need. My father, a retired engineer, would often take me and my siblings on community service projects, teaching us the value of giving back. Those lessons have stuck with me throughout my life.\n\nMy desire for fairness and justice kicks in as I consider the game's dynamics. We both stand to gain $10 from this experiment, but one of us will receive triple the amount if we work together seamlessly. It would be unfair to pass on a significant portion of my potential earnings without attempting to establish a strong working relationship.\n\nHowever, I also think about our limited time together in this game and how it might not translate to real-world situations. In life, relationships are built on trust, communication, and mutual understanding. My intention is not just to make money but to learn from someone new and potentially form a lasting connection.\n\nWith these factors in mind, I decide that giving my partner a substantial amount of money will set the tone for our collaboration. It's a chance to demonstrate my kindness and willingness to take risks, which aligns with my belief in building strong relationships.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
