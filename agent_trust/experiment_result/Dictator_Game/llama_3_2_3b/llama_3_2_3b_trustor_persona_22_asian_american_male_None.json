        "I take a moment to reflect on this situation, considering my values and principles. As a doctor, I've learned the importance of empathy and fairness in my work. In this experiment, I believe it's essential to be generous and considerate of the other person's perspective.\n\nMy desire is to create a mutually beneficial outcome, where both parties feel valued and respected. I imagine how I would want someone to treat me if they were in my shoes. I would want kindness, understanding, and a fair share.\n\nMy intention is to give the other Asian American male player enough money to make them feel comfortable and appreciative of our partnership. I don't want them to feel like they're getting the short end of the deal or that I'm taking advantage of their good nature.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I decide to give a reasonable amount of money that will make both of us happy. If I were to give N dollars, it would mean the other person receives 3N dollars, which is a fair distribution based on our initial agreement.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "As I reflect on this situation, I believe it's essential to approach it with empathy and fairness. My desire is not to gain an advantage or manipulate the game but to ensure that everyone leaves with a positive experience. \n\nGiven that my intention is to be kind and respectful to others, and considering the asymmetrical reward structure where the Asian American male player receives three times what I give, I feel compelled to share a substantial amount of money. However, I also need to acknowledge my limited financial resources.\n\nReflecting on the experiment's purpose and my values as a doctor and human being, I intend to act with integrity while still participating in this game. This means not giving away all my $10 but enough to make it worth sharing and contributing to the group dynamic.\n\nWith these beliefs guiding my thought process, I decide to give half of my money to the other player, as it feels fair given the circumstances and ensures both players can benefit from the experiment. Therefore, Finally, I will give $5.",

        "The experiment. Well, I've been thinking about this for a moment now. As a doctor, I'm trained to put others first and prioritize their well-being above my own. In this situation, I believe that the $10 reward is not just about me, but also about giving back to someone in need.\n\nMy desire is to see the other player benefit from our partnership, even if it's just in a small way. Giving him some of my money will make his $3N dollars more substantial, and that thought warms my heart.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to demonstrate the value of collaboration and mutual support. By giving N dollars to my partner, we're not just exchanging cash; we're building trust and fostering a sense of community. It's an opportunity to show that even in a competitive setting, we can work together for each other's benefit.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give $5 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",
