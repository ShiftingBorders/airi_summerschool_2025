        "I'm not sure about this experiment, but I'll give it a try. As I sit down across from my opponent, I can feel a mix of nerves and curiosity. I don't know who she is or where she's coming from, but I'm willing to make a deal.\n\nFrom what I've learned about humans, we're all connected in some way. We all have the same desires and fears. And in this situation, both of us want to come out on top, right? But as a doctor, I've also learned that empathy is key. So, my first instinct is to try to understand where she's coming from.\n\nAs I think about it, I realize that she's probably not here to hurt me or gain an advantage over me just for the sake of it. She might have her own motivations, her own struggles and fears. And maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to work together.\n\nSo, my intention is to be fair, to make sure that whoever I'm making this deal with comes out on top. I don't want to take advantage of someone who's already at a disadvantage.\n\nMy desire is to win, but not at the expense of someone else. I want to see both of us succeed.\n\nAnd as for my belief, I believe that we're all human beings deserving of respect and fairness. We all have something to offer, no matter where we come from or who we are.\n\nWith those thoughts in mind, I'll make a decision that aligns with my values and principles. I won't just think about what's best for me; I'll consider what's best for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nAs I consider my options, I reflect on my belief system. I believe in fairness and equality. I've seen firsthand the impact of systemic inequalities in our society, and I believe that we all have a responsibility to promote greater understanding and empathy between different cultures and backgrounds.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive difference in this world. As a doctor, I've had the privilege of helping countless people overcome health challenges and improve their quality of life. Now, I want to take that same sense of purpose and apply it to this experiment.\n\nMy intention is to be honest and authentic in my decision-making process. I don't know this person, and I won't let assumptions or biases influence my choice. Instead, I'll focus on what I think is fair and just.\n\nAs I weigh the options, I consider the fact that our economies are vastly different. My player will receive only $10, while yours could potentially receive up to $30. However, I also believe in reciprocity and mutual respect.\n\nIn the end, my intention is to be generous without being exploitative. I want to show that we can work together and find common ground, even in a game of chance. With that in mind, I'll give enough to demonstrate my goodwill while still protecting my own interests.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I've been told that it's all about understanding personal biases and interactions between people of different backgrounds.\n\nAs a doctor, I've always prided myself on my ability to remain neutral and compassionate towards all patients, regardless of their background or situation. But I have to admit, the thought of giving money to someone without knowing who they are makes me a little uncomfortable.\n\nFrom a philosophical standpoint, I believe that we all deserve respect and fairness, regardless of our skin color or cultural background. And as someone who's been fortunate enough to achieve success in my field, I feel a sense of responsibility to use my position to uplift others.\n\nHowever, when it comes down to making a decision in this experiment, my desire is not to lose money, but rather to understand the dynamics at play here. But at the same time, my intention is to be fair and act with integrity, even if it means giving someone less than I would want for myself.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided that I'll give $5 to the other White American female player. It's not a lot of money, but I hope it shows that I'm willing to put aside my own biases and do the right thing, even if it's not the easiest or most obvious choice.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
