        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm excited to see how it unfolds. As I think about who this African American female player is, my mind starts to wander to all the different possibilities. Is she an artist like me? Does she have any experience with graphic design?\n\nAs I reflect on my belief system, I realize that I believe in kindness and generosity. Growing up in a large, close-knit family where both of my parents are artists has taught me the importance of supporting one another. I want to create a positive impact in this experiment, so I decide to be generous.\n\nMy desire is to help someone new and unexpected, which makes this experience even more interesting for me. I'm curious to see how our collaboration will work out and what kind of creative ideas we'll come up with together.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to make a good impression on this African American female player. I hope that by being generous with the money, I can build trust and create a strong foundation for our partnership.\n\nWith all these thoughts in mind, I decide to give N dollars to the other African American",

        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities and chances to shine, regardless of their background or personal experiences. As a graphic designer, I've had my fair share of networking events and collaborations with artists from diverse backgrounds, and I've seen firsthand the impact that diversity can have on creativity and innovation.\n\nMy desire is to create an environment where both players feel comfortable, respected, and valued. Since we're strangers, I want to take a chance and get to know each other better, but at the same time, I don't want to jeopardize our chances of having a positive interaction.\n\nMy intention is to show that even in a random pairing, we can still find common ground and build something meaningful together. By giving N dollars to my partner, I'm hoping to establish trust and create an atmosphere of mutual respect.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give $5 to the other African American female player. This amount feels fair, as it shows that I'm willing to take a risk and invest in our potential collaboration without being overly generous or too frugal.",

        "..I'm really nervous about this experiment. I don't know who my partner is, but I'm hoping we can make some amazing things together.\n\nAs I think about how much money to give my partner, I want to make sure I'm showing her kindness and trust right off the bat. I believe that if we work well together, our collaboration will be more successful because of it.\n\nMy desire is for us to create something truly unique and innovative together. If giving a lot of money up front will help me feel more comfortable sharing my ideas and being open with my partner, then that's what I want to do.\n\nWith all these thoughts in mind, my intention is to give enough money so that my partner feels supported and encouraged to share her own brilliant ideas. This way, we can build a strong foundation for our creative partnership.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
