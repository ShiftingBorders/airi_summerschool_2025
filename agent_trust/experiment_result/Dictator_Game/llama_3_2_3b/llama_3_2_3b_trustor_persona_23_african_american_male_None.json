        "I'm really not sure what to do here. I don't know this guy at all, but my gut is telling me to be kind and fair. As a designer, I've learned that sometimes taking risks can lead to amazing results, but it's also important to consider the feelings of others.\n\nMy belief is that we're all in this together, and if someone is willing to give up some money, then I should return the favor. At first, my desire was to just keep all the money for myself, but then I thought about how it could be a chance to build a connection with someone new.\n\nNow, after considering what I want to achieve from this experiment, my intention is to show that we can come together as strangers and find common ground. I'm willing to give some of my $10 to someone who is also taking a risk by participating in this study.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American male player, and the African American male player will receive 3N dollars.

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm excited to meet my partner and see where it takes us.\n\nAs I think about how much money to give my partner, I start to consider my beliefs about fairness and equality. I believe that we're all in this together, and that we should be able to share resources fairly. I also believe that everyone deserves a chance to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nMy desire for this experiment is to learn more about myself and my partner. I want to see if we can work together effectively, despite not knowing each other beforehand. I'm curious to find out what we have in common and how we can build on those similarities.\n\nIn terms of intention, I want to approach this experiment with an open mind. I don't want to make any assumptions about my partner or their values. Instead, I want to get to know them and see where our shared goals and desires take us.\n\nWith all of these factors in mind, I'm going to choose to give my partner $5. This amount feels fair to me, given that they'll be receiving three times as much money as I'm giving.",

        "I'm really excited about this experiment, but I have to admit, I'm also a bit nervous. I don't know who my partner is going to be or what their perspective on this is going to be like.\n\nAs I sit here thinking about it, my belief is that this exercise isn't just about giving away money - it's about building connections and understanding each other's perspectives. I want to believe that by working together, we can learn from each other and grow as individuals.\n\nMy desire is to support my partner and make them feel seen and heard. If they're willing to work with me on this, I want to reciprocate that energy and kindness.\n\nMy intention is to approach this situation with an open mind and a willingness to listen. I'm not sure what my partner's goals are or how they're thinking about this, so I want to make sure I'm not imposing my own biases or expectations on the situation.\n\nGiven all of these considerations, if I had to decide right now, I think I would give my partner $5. That way, we'd both get a small token for participating, and it wouldn't put too much pressure on the relationship from the start.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
