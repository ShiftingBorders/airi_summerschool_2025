        "I'm so down for this experiment! I'm excited to meet my partner and see what kind of connection we can make with each other.\n\nAs I reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions in this situation, I realize that I want to start fresh and get to know the person who's been paired with me. I believe that money isn't everything, but it can be a great equalizer if given in the right context. My desire is to create a fair and balanced exchange where both of us feel respected and valued.\n\nIn terms of my intention, I want to make sure that our interaction isn't just about the money, but also about building a connection with each other as individuals. I intend to be genuine, open, and communicative in our exchange, and to listen actively to what the other person has to say.\n\nWith all these factors in mind, I've decided on an amount that feels fair and friendly. Since we're both starting from the same place with $10, I think it's only right that we try to make each other feel good. So, I'm going to give my partner $5. That way, she'll receive 3 x $5 = $15, and I'll be left with $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm so excited about this experiment! I've always been drawn to creative collaborations and I think it's going to be fascinating to work with someone new and unknown.\n\nFrom what I know about myself, I believe that I have the skills and knowledge to bring value to the table, but I also recognize that coming from a big, close-knit family of artists might influence my design style. I want to learn from others and be open to their perspectives, so I'm excited to see how my design will be received.\n\nMy desire is to create something beautiful and unique, while still being mindful of the fact that I'm collaborating with someone new. I don't want to overshadow them or steal their ideas, but at the same time, I also want to showcase my own talents.\n\nAs for my intention, it's simple: I want to create a design that we both love and that will bring us closer together as collaborators. I believe that by working together, we can create something truly special and unique.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I think about how much money I want to give to the other Asian American female player... I'm willing to take a chance and offer her $5 dollars, trusting that our collaboration will be a positive one. If she feels that the deal is unfair or unbalanced, then I hope we can work together to find a solution.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I can already feel my instincts kicking in. As I consider giving money to this stranger, my first thought is about fairness and equality. Given the experimental nature of our situation, I don't know anything about her background, skills, or personality. However, as an artist, I believe that creativity and collaboration are essential for growth and learning.\n\nMy desire to connect with someone new and share ideas sparks a sense of excitement. I'd love to see where this connection can take us, but I also recognize the importance of respecting boundaries. Since we don't know each other, I need to prioritize a neutral starting point.\n\nWith my intention to be open-minded and supportive, I decide to give her an equal opportunity to share in the $10. Giving her half of it would not only demonstrate fairness but also show that I value our new connection equally. By doing so, I'm not setting expectations or creating pressure; I'm simply being a kind and generous stranger.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
