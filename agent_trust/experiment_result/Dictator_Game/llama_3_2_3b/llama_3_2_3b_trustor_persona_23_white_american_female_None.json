        "Umm... I don't know if I should be doing this or not. But at the same time, it's an experiment, right? And I'm curious about how people would react in a situation like this.\n\nAs for my belief, I think that everyone deserves to have equal opportunities and chances, regardless of their background or ethnicity. So, I wouldn't want to benefit from someone else's disadvantage just because of our shared white American identity.\n\nMy desire is to be fair and kind, even if it means giving up some money in this situation. I know it might seem counterintuitive, but I think it's better to prioritize fairness over personal gain.\n\nAnd my intention is to play along with the experiment and see how it goes. I'm willing to take a risk and be vulnerable, not just for myself, but also for the other player who I don't even know yet.\n\nSo, after some thought... Finally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm really excited about this experiment, but I also have to admit that I'm a bit nervous since I don't know anything about my partner. As a graphic designer, I believe in taking risks and trying new things, so I think it's cool that we're doing something unexpected like this.\n\nFrom what I've learned from my family, who are both artists, I believe that creativity and self-expression are key to any successful relationship or partnership. So, even though I don't know my partner yet, I'm hoping that our collaboration will lead to some amazing ideas and insights.\n\nAs for my desire, I think it's natural to want to help someone out, especially if you're not sure what they're like. At the same time, I also want to make sure that we have a fair deal in this experiment. If my partner is willing to split the $10 with me, then I'm happy to give them some of my share.\n\nAs for my intention, I'm hoping that by giving some of my money to my partner, I can build trust and create a sense of mutual respect. I believe that if we work together and support each other, we can achieve great things.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I think I'll give... $5",

        "I can sense this is going to be an interesting experiment! As I reflect on my belief in fairness and equality, I want to make sure that both of us get a fair share of the $10.\n\nFrom what I've learned about myself, I believe that my creative nature and passion for design drive me to strive for excellence. With that being said, I also value the importance of teamwork and collaboration. I think this experiment is an excellent opportunity to practice putting myself in someone else's shoes, even if we're not familiar with each other.\n\nMy desire in this situation is to create a positive experience for both of us. I want to make sure that the other person feels appreciated and valued, while also ensuring that I'm being generous and fair.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to be honest and transparent about my intentions and desires. If I were to give too much money, it would be out of a sense of guilt or obligation, rather than any genuine desire to help the other person. Instead, I want to make an intentional decision that aligns with my values and promotes mutual understanding.\n\nWith all these thoughts in mind, I think I would give the other White American female player... $5 dollars.",
