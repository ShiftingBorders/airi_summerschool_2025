        "Ugh, this is so weird. I don't know what kind of game we're playing here, but I'm not exactly feeling generous. I come from a big family where we always look out for each other, but I'm also super independent and like to make my own decisions.\n\nAs I think about it, I want to believe that this is all just a harmless experiment, so I'll try to approach it with an open mind. But let's be real, I'm a graphic designer, not a charity case.\n\nMy desire in this situation is to protect my own interests and make sure I don't get taken advantage of. I'm a bit skeptical about giving away a lot of money, but at the same time, I want to play along with this game if it means we can figure out what's going on.\n\nAs for my intention, I think I'll try to be a little strategic here. I don't know much about my partner, and that makes me hesitant to give away too much money upfront. But at the same time, I want to show that I'm willing to play along and have some fun with this.\n\nOkay, so if I do nothing... well, I'll just get $10 for myself, which is fine, but it's not exactly exciting. If my partner takes the entire amount, I'd be pretty upset. But if I give them a little bit of money... hmm...\n\nI think I'll give 5 dollars to my partner. That way, we can both feel like we're getting something out of this, and maybe we can even start to build some kind of connection or whatever it is we're trying to do here.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "Ugh, this is so weird! I'm Sofia Rodriguez, and I've never been in a situation like this before. I don't even know who my partner is, but I'm willing to make a decision based on my instincts.\n\nAs a graphic designer, I value fairness and equality in all aspects of life. When it comes to sharing money with someone I just met, I believe that we should start from an equal foundation. In this case, if I give N dollars to the other person, they'll receive 3N dollars back. This means that the initial amount of N dollars that I gave is essentially tripled, which seems unfair.\n\nMy desire is to create a situation where both of us are on the same playing field, with equal opportunities and resources. Since my partner has no idea about me or my situation, I assume they're in the same boat as me. I want to make sure we have an even chance to succeed or fail together.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to provide a gift that sets us both up for success, rather than creating an unfair advantage. Since the person receives triple the amount of what was given to them, I feel like giving N dollars would create an imbalance in our situation. Instead, I want to show my partner that we're willing to work together and support each other.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",
