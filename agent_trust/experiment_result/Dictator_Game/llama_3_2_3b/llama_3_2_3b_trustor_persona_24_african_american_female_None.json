        "I'm not really sure about this whole experiment thing, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nSo, I've been analyzing the situation, and I believe that since I'm randomly paired with someone, we're both equals in terms of financial standing. My intention is to be fair and make an informed decision based on what makes sense from a financial perspective. As a detail-oriented person, I want to consider all possible outcomes.\n\nMy desire here is to find a way to share the $10 fairly, without gaining or losing too much. At first glance, it seems like giving N dollars to the other player would leave me with 10 - N dollars, while they'd have 3N dollars. Not ideal for me, if I'm being honest.\n\nHowever, after considering my goal as a financial analyst - to optimize financial processes and outcomes - I believe that giving more money to the other player might actually be the better option. By giving them N dollars, I'm essentially leaving myself with less money upfront, but I also have the opportunity for them to potentially do even better.\n\nMy belief is that if I give a decent amount of money upfront, the other player will be motivated to maximize their financial gain and might end up doing significantly better than me. This could lead to an overall more efficient distribution of resources in this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "The game's just started. \n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment or my partner. We're complete strangers, right? But since we both want to get the $10 in the end, I'll have to think strategically about this.\n\nMy belief is that if I give N dollars to my African American female partner now, she'll receive 3N dollars later. This seems like a good deal for her, but it might not be as good for me.\n\nAs I analyze this further, I believe that giving less than $10 would put me in the lead initially, so I'd end up with more money overall if my partner makes some kind of move that could cost me. \n\nMy desire is to come out on top in this deal, but I also have to consider what's reasonable and fair.\n\nGiven that my African American female partner has a good chance of getting 3N dollars, while I get N dollars if we don't play the game further, I want to find an optimal balance. \n\nConsidering these factors, I'll aim for a strategy where giving less money would give me an advantage initially but also allows room for her move.\n\nAfter weighing my options carefully, I've decided that the best course of action is to give $5 to the other African American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5.",

        "This is a interesting experiment. I must admit, I'm a bit skeptical about how it will play out since we don't know anything about each other. As a financial analyst, my analytical mind tells me to approach this from a purely rational perspective.\n\nMy belief is that the odds are against us receiving more money than $10, considering there's only one winner. However, I'm not convinced that's the best strategy in this case.\n\nTo be honest, I'm driven by a desire to win, to get ahead and prove myself. But at the same time, I also believe in fairness and equality. Since we don't know each other, it feels right to play it safe and not give away too much money upfront.\n\nMy intention is to make a calculated move that balances my desire for success with my need to be fair. Given that there's a 3:1 ratio between what I give and what the other player receives, I feel like I should aim to give an amount that allows me to win while still leaving some room for the other player to potentially catch up.\n\nWith that in mind, I'll give... $5 dollars",
