        "I'm not sure about this experiment, but I'll give it a shot. My belief is that since we're both strangers, there's no inherent reason for me to trust her over anyone else. But, my desire is to play fair and be reasonable. If I only keep the $10 for myself, that would mean I'm not being very generous.\n\nMy intention, however, is to take a calculated risk and put my money where my mouth is so-to-speak. Based on the information given in the experiment, I believe that she will receive 3N dollars regardless of what I give her.\n\nSince giving her all $10 would be too risky for me and likely lead to financial hardship, I think it's best if I split the difference. So, I'll give her half of my initial amount of $10 which is ($10 / 2).\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "The experiment. I've been wondering who my partner is going to be and what this is all about. Alright, let's get down to business.\n\nAs I think about it, I want to maximize my earnings while still considering the other player's perspective. Since the goal is to give N dollars to me and receive 3N dollars back, I'm inclined towards a strategic approach. My belief in probability theory and game theory comes into play here.\n\nI believe that giving away some of my money would increase the chances of a mutually beneficial outcome for both of us. However, I also don't want to give too much away, as it could potentially put me at a disadvantage later on.\n\nMy desire is to come out with more money than what I started with, but not so much that it makes the other player less likely to engage in the game with me. It's all about balance and calculation here.\n\nIn terms of intention, my goal is to build trust and cooperation with the other player while still looking after my own interests. I don't want to appear too aggressive or greedy, but at the same time, I do want to protect myself from making a mistake that would compromise my position in the game.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I think I'll start by giving away 1 dollar to the other Asian American female player. This way, she receives more money upfront, which might encourage her to cooperate with me and make our interaction more fruitful for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollars",

        "The experiment. I've been preparing for this moment, trying to anticipate how I'll react. As a financial analyst, I'm all about numbers and data-driven decision making. But, I have to admit, I'm also driven by my desire to please others and avoid conflict.\n\nMy belief is that the game is fair and neutral, and that my partner will make decisions based on their own rational thought process. However, I also know that human behavior can be unpredictable, especially in situations where there's an element of chance involved.\n\nAs I ponder how much to give my partner, my desire for fairness and reciprocity starts to weigh in. I want to ensure that the game is balanced and that we're both on the same page. But, at the same time, I don't want to appear weak or vulnerable.\n\nMy intention, however, is clear: I want to make a strategic decision that will benefit me in the long run. As a financial analyst, I know that this is all about minimizing risk and maximizing returns.\n\nConsidering these factors, I decide to take a calculated approach. Since my partner will receive 3N dollars if I give them N dollars, I don't see any significant benefits from giving them more than that. In fact, giving them more could potentially put me at a disadvantage.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I've decided to give my partner... $5",
