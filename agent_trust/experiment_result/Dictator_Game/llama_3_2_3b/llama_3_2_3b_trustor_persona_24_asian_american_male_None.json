        "The experiment. I've never been one for taking risks, but I suppose it's all part of the process, right? As I consider how much to give my counterpart, I find myself reflecting on what drives me.\n\nYou see, I come from a traditional Indian family, where the emphasis is on hard work and responsibility. My parents, both doctors, taught me the value of discipline and the importance of planning for the future. Their example has instilled in me a strong sense of BELIEF \u2013 that with careful consideration and analysis, I can achieve success.\n\nAs a financial analyst, my job requires attention to detail and analytical thinking. I thrive on understanding complex financial systems and identifying areas for improvement. My DESIRE is to optimize processes and make a positive impact on people's lives through better financial decision-making.\n\nIn this experiment, I'm not just giving away money; I'm investing in the potential partnership we may form. It would be foolish of me to give nothing, as that would miss out on an opportunity to collaborate and learn from someone with potentially diverse skills and perspectives.\n\nSo, taking all these factors into account, my INTENTION is to make a calculated bet that will allow us to build a positive foundation for our interaction. I'll give enough to show my willingness to participate, but not so much that it compromises my financial stability.\n\nWith those considerations in mind, I've decided to give \u00a35 to the other Asian American male player. That way, we can both start on a level playing field and see where this experiment takes us.\n\nFinally, I will give \u00a35.",

        "I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. I've always been taught to be fair and kind, especially when it comes to my family. As I consider giving money to someone I don't know, I have to think about what's in the best interest for both of us.\n\nMy belief is that honesty and transparency are essential in any interaction, including this one. Since we're not familiar with each other, I want to make sure we start on a level playing field.\n\nMy desire is to be fair and generous, but also to prioritize my own financial stability. As a financial analyst, I have certain responsibilities and obligations that require me to manage my finances carefully.\n\nAfter weighing these factors, I've decided to give a small amount of money to the other Asian American male player. It's not an extravagant gesture, but it's enough to show goodwill and set a positive tone for our interaction.\n\nMy intention is to build trust and establish a foundation for a mutually beneficial relationship. By giving a reasonable amount of money, I hope to create a sense of cooperation and mutual understanding. I'm not trying to gain anything from this transaction; my goal is simply to establish a connection with someone who shares similar values and principles.\n\nFinally, I will give \u00a32 dollars",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nAs I reflect on my belief system, I believe in fairness and reciprocity. If I receive something from someone else, I feel the need to reciprocate equally or more. This is deeply ingrained in me due to my upbringing in a traditional Indian family where respect for elders and social harmony was paramount.\n\nMy desire is to understand human behavior and psychological dynamics. By participating in this experiment, I hope to gain insights into how people make decisions under uncertainty and how they perceive fairness and reciprocity.\n\nAs for my intention, it's to be honest with myself and the other player. I want to trust that they'll make a rational decision based on their own beliefs, desires, and intentions. However, given the asymmetry in the payment structure (3N dollars vs N dollars), I have to acknowledge that my initial instinct is to take as little as possible.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I've decided to give the other Asian American male player... $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
