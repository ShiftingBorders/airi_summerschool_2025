        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment. I've never been one for sharing or taking risks with strangers, especially when it comes to money.\n\nAs a financial analyst, I believe that giving away a significant amount of my own money could jeopardize my personal financial stability and security. My desire is to maintain control over my finances and ensure that I have enough savings to fall back on in case of any unexpected expenses or emergencies.\n\nGiven these considerations, I intend to be cautious and prudent in this decision. Since the potential gain for the other player is triple what I give away, it's likely that they will choose a high amount, potentially leaving me with less money than I started with.\n\nTherefore, based on my belief in being careful with my finances and my desire to maintain control over my own money, I have decided not to give any dollars.",

        "Let me get into character.\n\nAs a financial analyst, I always try to approach problems with a logical mind. In this case, the situation is simple: we both receive $10, and one of us has the option to give some of it to the other. From a purely mathematical perspective, it's clear that if I give N dollars, the other person will receive 3N dollars.\n\nMy belief here is that since we're just playing an experiment, there's no real gain or loss involved for either of us. It's all just a game, and I'm curious to see how the other person will react.\n\nHowever, my desire to play it fair is also at work here. As someone from a traditional Indian family where honor and fairness are deeply valued, I feel like I should be willing to give some money to create a more equal distribution of funds. That being said, I'm not going to break the bank or sacrifice too much of my own $10.\n\nMy intention is to balance these competing forces. On one hand, I want to make sure that both of us end up with a fair amount of money. On the other hand, I don't want to give away too much of my own resources without getting something substantial in return.\n\nAfter weighing my options carefully, I've decided to choose a middle ground. Since we're playing an equal-opportunity game, and neither of us wants to appear cheap or greedy, let's aim for a roughly even split... but with the other person getting a bit more than me.\n\nConsidering this, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "The experiment is about money, isn't it? I'm not one for giving away large sums of money without thinking it through, but in this case, I think I need to be strategic.\n\nAs a financial analyst, I always look at things from different angles and try to make informed decisions based on the numbers. In this situation, my BELIEF is that it's better to give more money upfront rather than risking losing everything if we can come to some sort of mutually beneficial agreement later on.\n\nMy DESIRE is not to lose out on any potential earnings, but at the same time, I want to be fair and reasonable. If I'm being completely honest with myself, my initial reaction might be to give very little money to ensure I don't take too much risk, but that would probably lead to a stalemate or an unfavorable outcome for me.\n\nMy INTENTION is clear: I need to make sure this exchange benefits both of us in the long run. Since the White American female player will receive 3N dollars if I give N dollars, it seems like there's room for negotiation and finding a middle ground that could be beneficial for both parties.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, I think giving $5 to the other White American female player is a good starting point. It shows I'm willing to make an initial investment without overcommitting myself, which could lead to further discussions or collaborations down the line.",
