        "I've been paired with another participant, but I still don't know who it is. As I sit here, thinking about how much money to give my counterpart, I'm reminded of why I became a journalist in the first place - to uncover the truth and give voice to those who are marginalized or oppressed.\n\nIn this experiment, I want to believe that we're all equal, regardless of our background or identity. So, I won't make assumptions based on stereotypes or prejudices. Instead, I'll look at my intentions and desires. I desire to build a positive relationship with someone from a different culture, but I also know that we don't know each other's backgrounds.\n\nAs I ponder this, I realize that I have the power to choose how much money to give my counterpart. If I want to be generous, I could give them more money, and they would receive 3N dollars, which is a significant amount of money. But if I'm being honest with myself, I think I'd like to start with a smaller amount.\n\nI think my intention in giving this money is not just about the monetary value but also about building trust and establishing a connection. If I give them too much money right away, it might put pressure on our relationship and make it harder for us to get to know each other.\n\nSo, I've decided that I want to give my counterpart a more modest amount of money - $5. This way, we can start with a clean slate and focus on getting to know each other without any preconceptions or biases.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5.",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to play along. As I consider how much money to give to my partner, I think about our shared goal of uncovering the truth and giving a voice to those who need it most.\n\nMy belief is that this experiment is an opportunity for us to build bridges between different cultures and backgrounds. We may not know each other's stories yet, but we have the chance to learn from each other and grow as individuals. I believe that by working together, we can achieve more than we could alone.\n\nAs I think about my desire, I realize that I want to create a sense of trust and mutual respect with my partner. Giving her money is just one way to start building that connection. I desire for us to work together seamlessly, like two puzzle pieces falling into place. I desire for our partnership to be successful, not just in terms of the experiment, but also as friends.\n\nNow, considering my intention, I want to use this opportunity to think about the values we hold dear. As a journalist, I've seen firsthand the impact that marginalized communities can have on society. I intend to use this experience to learn from my partner's perspective and broaden my understanding of the world. I intend for us to work together to create a more just and equitable society.\n\nWith all these thoughts in mind, I decide to give N dollars to my partner. Giving her N dollars means that she'll receive 3N dollars, which is more than what I'm giving her, but it's not as much as the amount I could have given if I had chosen a different strategy. I'm choosing to be fair and balanced in this exchange.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "This is quite the unusual experiment, isn't it? I must admit, I'm both curious and a bit apprehensive about working with someone I don't know. But, as a journalist, I believe in fairness and equality. My desire is to build a relationship that's based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nAs I ponder this, I think about the intentions behind our partnership. Are we just two individuals from different backgrounds trying to get along for the sake of the experiment? Or can we use this opportunity to learn from each other and grow as people?\n\nIn light of these thoughts, I've decided that I want to give my partner a fair chance. I don't want to start off on the wrong foot or hold onto any biases. So, I think I'll give her N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
