        "The experiment has begun, and I'm not sure what to expect from this random pairing with another individual. As I consider the financial aspect of this exchange, my thoughts turn to my own values and priorities.\n\nAs a journalist, I've always been driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to uncover the truth. In many cases, that means putting myself in vulnerable positions or facing uncomfortable situations to shed light on important issues. This experiment seems to align with those same principles \u2013 the idea is to take a risk and trust someone else with my limited resources.\n\nMy intention in this exchange is not purely financial; I want to understand what motivates another individual to make decisions like mine. What drives them to take risks or prioritize their own well-being over financial gain? Are they also driven by a sense of justice, or perhaps a desire for personal growth?\n\nGiven these thoughts and intentions, I'd like to give the other Asian American male player as much money as possible, at least initially. This would allow me to gauge his response to the financial aspect of our agreement without influencing his decisions too greatly. If he's truly driven by my values or willing to take similar risks, I can then reassess and make a more informed decision about how to proceed.\n\nIf I were to give him $1, that would be an appropriate starting point for me. It allows us both to take a calculated risk while still giving each other space to maneuver.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollars",

        "The experiment! I must say, I'm both curious and skeptical about this whole thing. As a journalist, I value truth and fairness above all else. \n\nGiven my background in giving voice to the marginalized and fighting for justice, I believe it's essential to be fair and equitable in any situation, especially when it comes to something like money.\n\nMy desire is not just to gain a sum of money but also to see if our initial perceptions and biases can be put aside. As someone who has experienced being an outsider myself (as a Pakistani woman in Dubai), I understand the importance of empathy and understanding.\n\nWith that in mind, I would like to think about how this experiment aligns with my values and goals as a journalist. If I were to give the Asian American male player some money, it would be to test whether our social constructs of fairness and reciprocity apply here too.\n\nIf that's the case, then I would like to give him N dollars, not because I want to gain an advantage but simply because it seems the fairest option. If we're both going to get 3N and N dollars respectively, it doesn't seem unfair to start with a smaller amount for the other player.\n\nSo, in this experiment, my intention is to see if fairness can be applied in different contexts without compromising our personal goals or desires. \n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm so excited to be part of this experiment! As I consider who to give money to, my mind starts racing with thoughts of fairness and justice. My belief is that everyone deserves an equal chance at success, regardless of their background or ethnicity.\n\nMy desire is to help someone in need, but it's not just about giving away free money. It's about creating a positive impact on someone's life. I want the person I give money to to know that they're seen and appreciated. As a journalist, I've often encountered individuals who have been marginalized or overlooked by society. Giving them a helping hand would be a powerful statement.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to promote kindness and generosity. By giving an equal amount of money, regardless of whether it's more or less than $10, I'm showing that everyone deserves the same respect and dignity. I choose not to give away my entire share of $10 because doing so would undermine the fairness and equality I believe in.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
