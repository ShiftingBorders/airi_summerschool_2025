        "The unknowns in this experiment excite me more than anything. As I sit across from my counterpart, I can feel the anticipation building up inside me. My belief system tells me that we come from different backgrounds and have unique perspectives, which is what makes this encounter so intriguing. I want to learn about her experiences, her beliefs, and her values.\n\nMy desire to understand and connect with someone new drives me to be open-minded and curious. I'm eager to hear her thoughts and feelings, even if they differ from mine. This opportunity to bridge the cultural divide and find common ground is invaluable to me.\n\nHowever, as a journalist, my intention is to seek truth and fairness in all aspects of life. In this case, the rules of the experiment dictate that for every N dollars I give, she will receive 3N dollars. But, as a woman from a Middle Eastern background who has witnessed her fair share of social inequalities, I feel compelled to distribute the money more evenly.\n\nI decide to give half of my $10, which is $5, to the other White American female player.",

        "The game, it seems like a challenge to break down the stereotypes and biases that often come with our interactions across cultures. As a journalist, I've always been passionate about giving a voice to those who don't have one, and this experiment feels like an opportunity to do just that.\n\nMy belief in equality and fairness drives me to want to make this exchange as fair as possible, despite the cultural differences between us. I desire to build trust and understanding with my partner, even though we don't know each other's backgrounds or experiences.\n\nWith these intentions in mind, I would like to give my partner $5. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm so excited about this experiment! I'm always up for trying new things and pushing my boundaries.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give to my partner, I think about our situation. We're complete strangers from different parts of the world, with no pre-existing relationship or connection. However, I do feel a sense of responsibility to be fair and ensure that we both benefit equally.\n\nFrom a selfless perspective, if I were to give away all $10, it would mean that my partner gets to keep the entire amount, which could provide her with some much-needed financial support. This aligns with my belief in being kind and generous towards others, especially those who may be in need.\n\nHowever, on a more practical note, if I only gave away half of the $10 ($5), I would still get to keep an equal amount ($5). This way, we both benefit equally from our exchange. My desire for fairness and equality in this situation plays a significant role in my decision-making process.\n\nUltimately, my intention behind giving away a portion of the money is not just about providing financial support but also about building trust and establishing a sense of mutual respect with my partner. I believe that by being generous and open-minded, we can create a more positive and productive dynamic in our exchange.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
