        "This is such a tough decision for me! As a journalist, I've always believed in fairness and equality. When it comes down to it, I know that my partner in this experiment is someone who doesn't come from the same background or culture as me. I have to consider the power dynamics at play here.\n\nTo be honest, when I first heard about this experiment, I was a bit hesitant. I wasn't sure if I wanted to play along and risk giving away money to someone I didn't even know. But then I thought about why we're doing this - to explore our reactions to unfair distributions of resources. And that's exactly what my intention is here.\n\nAs I think about it, I realize that my desire is not to be seen as unfair or biased just because I'm a woman from the Middle East. I want to show that I can make rational decisions and consider the well-being of others. My belief in fairness and justice guides me in this decision-making process.\n\nIn the end, after weighing everything out, I think I will give $5 dollars to my partner.",

        "This is a very interesting experiment! As I consider giving money to my unknown partner, I want to start by understanding their perspective and motivations. As a journalist, I'm always curious about people's stories and experiences. I believe that giving them some of my $10 will not only be generous but also an opportunity for us to connect and understand each other better.\n\nMy desire to give money is not just about being charitable; it's also about fostering trust and creating a level playing field. By giving N dollars, I'm hoping to create a mutual understanding that we're both in this together, despite our cultural and geographical differences.\n\nMy intention is to give enough money to make the exchange fair and reasonable. Since my partner will receive 3N dollars in return, I want to ensure that the ratio of our transactions is equal. This way, both of us can walk away feeling satisfied with the outcome.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give $5 to my partner. By doing so, we'll be at an equal footing, and I believe this will create a strong foundation for our experiment. Finally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "The rules of this experiment seem quite straightforward, but I must say I'm intrigued by the idea of pairing up with someone from a different background and culture. As I ponder this decision, my belief system comes into play.\n\nI firmly believe in the importance of equality and fairness. In this experiment, we're given the opportunity to decide how to distribute $10 among us. While it's tempting to try to get more money for myself, my desire lies in finding a balance that ensures both parties benefit from our interaction.\n\nIntentionally, I want to promote a sense of trust and collaboration between us. By giving some of my own money to the other player, I'm signaling that I value our partnership and am willing to invest in its success. This intention is rooted in my desire to create a positive experience for both of us, despite our cultural differences.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give $5 to the other White American male player. By doing so, I'm not trying to cheat myself out of money, but rather creating an opportunity for us to build a connection based on mutual respect and understanding. This amount seems reasonable, given that it's half of my initial amount, leaving me with enough to maintain my own financial stability.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
