        "This is quite unexpected. A study group, you say? And I'm paired with someone from...Africa, I believe?\n\nWell, my intention is to do what's best for both of us. I want us to succeed in this experiment, and I think we can work together. As a chef, I've always believed that sharing knowledge and expertise is essential to growth.\n\nMy desire is to understand the other person's perspective, even if our cultural backgrounds differ greatly. Maybe there are some cooking techniques or ingredients from his region that I haven't tried before. I'm eager to learn and broaden my culinary horizons.\n\nAs for giving money, I'd like to start with a gesture of goodwill. Since we both need this $10 to succeed, I think it's only fair that we help each other out. I'll give...$5 to the other African American male player, so he can focus on his part of the experiment without worrying about the financial aspect.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I take a deep breath, trying to understand this experiment and my role in it. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to learn and adapt. As a chef, I'm used to working with flavors and ingredients to create something new and exciting. I think of the African American male player as an equal, someone who shares this common ground.\n\nMy belief is that we're both here to try something new and have fun. We don't know each other's backgrounds or culinary expertise, so it's a fresh start. My desire is to learn from each other, to share our knowledge and techniques, and to create something amazing together. I want us to have a positive experience, one that we can both look back on with pride.\n\nMy intention is to be kind and generous. Even though there's a small amount of money at stake, I don't think it's about winning or losing. It's about the experience we're having right now. So, I decide to give a small amount of my own money to the African American male player, hoping that he'll do the same.\n\nI give $5 dollars",
