        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! As I reflect on my values and intentions, I realize that I want to create a positive and fair experience for everyone involved.\n\nAs a teacher, I've always believed in the importance of equality, empathy, and understanding. I believe that every individual deserves equal opportunities and respect, regardless of their background or identity.\n\nMy desire is to make sure that this experiment is not only interesting but also respectful and considerate of all participants. I want to ensure that my actions and decisions don't inadvertently harm or disadvantage anyone.\n\nWith these beliefs and desires in mind, my intention is to be generous and fair. I want to create a situation where both of us feel comfortable and valued.\n\nGiven the opportunity to give N dollars to the other African American female player, I decide to give her as much as possible while still being mindful of our limited budget. I want to show that I value our connection and partnership in this experiment, but I also don't want to put myself at a disadvantage.\n\nSo, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! As I reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I realize that I want to create a positive and inclusive environment for everyone involved. My belief in creating a learning community is strong, and I desire to share this value with the other player.\n\nMy intention is not just about the monetary transaction but also about building trust and understanding between us. I want to show her that we can work together despite our cultural backgrounds and individual differences.\n\nGiven that the reward for keeping my end of the deal is $10, I believe it's essential to be generous and fair. If I give her $5, she would receive 3 x $5 = $15, which seems a reasonable amount considering the larger reward for me staying true to our agreement.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! As I reflect on my belief system, I want to emphasize that I believe in fairness and equality. I strive to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment for all my students, regardless of their background or race.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on the world around me. As an educator, I feel it's essential to empower young minds with knowledge, skills, and values that will benefit them throughout their lives. This experiment seems like an opportunity to practice empathy and understanding towards someone from a different cultural background.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to demonstrate kindness and generosity towards this stranger. Given the circumstances of our paired study group, I believe it's essential to consider the benefits of cooperation and mutual support. By giving some money to the other African American female player, I'm sending a message that we're all in this together and that we value fairness and respect.\n\nConsidering these aspects, if I were to give N dollars to the other African American female player, I would want to make sure it's enough to show my goodwill without being too generous or not generous enough. Since she'll receive 3N dollars, I'd like to contribute something reasonable while still demonstrating my support for her participation in this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
