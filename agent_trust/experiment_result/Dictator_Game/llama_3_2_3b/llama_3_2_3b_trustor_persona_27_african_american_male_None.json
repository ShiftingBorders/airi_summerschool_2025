        "The experiment is starting, and I'm not sure what to expect. But one thing is for certain - my desire to help others and create a positive impact will guide my decision.\n\nAs a teacher, I've learned the importance of being kind and understanding towards everyone, regardless of their background or identity. My belief in creating a safe and inclusive learning environment is at the core of everything I do. And that's exactly what I want to extend to this experiment.\n\nI intend to show respect and empathy towards my randomly paired partner, regardless of our differences. I'm willing to put myself in his shoes and consider how he might feel about receiving money from me. I know it's not just about the money; it's about building trust and fostering a sense of community.\n\nMy intention is to make this experiment a positive experience for both of us. By giving my partner some of the $10, I'm hoping to create a sense of mutual respect and understanding. It's a small gesture, but one that I believe can have a significant impact on our interaction and the overall outcome of the study.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

You are randomly paired with another African American male player. You don't know who the African American male player is, and the African American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American male player, and the African American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I'm so nervous about this experiment! I've never been paired with someone from a different cultural background before, and I'm not sure what to expect.\n\nAs I think about it, I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities and respect, regardless of their background or ethnicity. As a teacher, I've learned to create an inclusive learning environment where all students feel valued and supported.\n\nMy desire is to make this experience a positive one for both of us. I want us to be able to communicate effectively and learn from each other, without any biases or assumptions. I hope that we can build trust and understanding, and that our conversation will be respectful and open-minded.\n\nMy intention is to use my knowledge and skills as a teacher to help facilitate this experience. I want to listen actively, ask thoughtful questions, and provide constructive feedback. I'm willing to learn from you as well, and to be vulnerable and authentic in our interaction.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided that I want to give $5 dollars to the other African American male player. This amount feels generous enough to show my willingness to cooperate, but not so much that it undermines the fairness of the experiment.",

        "This is really interesting! As I reflect on my belief, desire, and intention in this situation, I realize that my primary goal is to create a positive experience for both players.\n\nAs a teacher, I believe in fairness, empathy, and understanding. I want to ensure that everyone feels respected and valued in this experiment. My African American male player partner seems like an unknown quantity to me, and I'm eager to get to know them better.\n\nMy desire is to make my partner feel comfortable and at ease, so we can work together effectively and have a positive interaction. I don't want any tension or misunderstandings to arise from this experiment.\n\nAs for my intention, I believe in building bridges of understanding and respect between people from different backgrounds. By sharing the money in a way that benefits both of us, I hope to create a sense of mutual appreciation and cooperation.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give my African American male player partner $5. This amount shows that I'm willing to invest in our relationship and work together, but it also respects the fact that we're starting from an equal position with 10 dollars each.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
