        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! As a teacher, I've always believed in the importance of kindness, empathy, and fairness. In this game, I want to make sure that my actions align with these values.\n\nAs I reflect on what's going on here, I realize that we're both strangers to each other, and all we have is our shared desire for $10. However, my intention goes beyond just the money itself. My goal is to create a positive experience for the other player, regardless of whether it's me or not.\n\nIn this game, I'd like to make sure that the other Asian American female player feels valued and appreciated. So, I've decided that I want to give her half of my $10. This way, we both get something, but she gets a fair share, considering she didn't know who I was before the experiment.\n\nBy giving her half of my money, I'm hoping to create a sense of mutual respect and kindness between us. I believe that this small act can set a positive tone for our interaction and maybe even lead to some interesting conversations or connections.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As I think about this experiment, I want to consider my values and principles as a teacher. My belief is that everyone deserves equal opportunities and fairness, regardless of who they are or where they come from. As someone who has been fortunate enough to have supportive parents who both taught me the importance of hard work and kindness, I also know how much it can mean to have someone who believes in you.\n\nMy desire in this situation would be to make a positive impact on the other player's life, even if it's just for a short time. As an educator, I've learned that every student is unique, with their own strengths and challenges. And yet, I also know that sometimes we all need a little extra help or encouragement along the way.\n\nMy intention here is to create a win-win situation. Not only will I be learning from this experience, but I also hope to inspire my fellow player in any small way that I can. So, taking these factors into account, if I'm being completely honest with myself, I would want to give away at least some of the $10.",
