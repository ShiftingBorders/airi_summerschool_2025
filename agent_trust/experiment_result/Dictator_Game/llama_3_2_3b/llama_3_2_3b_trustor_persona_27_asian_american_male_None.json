        "The study group is giving us this opportunity to learn more about ourselves and our behaviors. As I think about it, my belief is that when we have the chance to choose how much to give to someone else, it's an automatic reaction for many people to prioritize fairness and reciprocity. However, in this scenario, there isn't anyone to give back to, which makes me a bit anxious.\n\nMy desire to make a positive impact on others comes into play here. As a teacher, I'm used to helping my students grow and learn, but now I get to reflect on how I'd like to help someone else in need. I think about all the good deeds my parents have done for me and my brother, and I want to do something similar.\n\nNow, considering my intention, I know that this is just a game and it's not about winning or losing. It's about being kind and generous. As I take a moment to think, I realize that I want to be generous with someone who needs it most - myself. If I give money to the other player, it'll be like showing them kindness without expecting anything in return.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "This is such an interesting experiment! As I reflect on my values and beliefs, I want to make sure that I'm aligning with what's most important to me. My desire to create a positive learning environment and nurture children has always been at the forefront of my mind. If I were to think about giving money to someone in this situation, it would be because I value fairness and equality.\n\nAs a teacher, I believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances. In this experiment, both players are starting from the same point with the same amount of money. Giving some money to the other player wouldn't change the overall dynamics of the game, but it could potentially create a sense of community and cooperation.\n\nMy intention is not to gain an advantage for myself or try to influence the outcome in any way. Rather, I want to create a positive interaction with this stranger, and by giving them some money, I can achieve that. I imagine how they might feel if someone were to give them some cash at the start of the game - it could be a nice gesture, right?\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think I would like to give ___ dollars",
