        "Oh dear! This is quite an interesting experiment we're about to embark on. As I consider who to give the money to, I want to reflect on my values and principles.\n\nYou see, as a teacher, I believe in fairness, empathy, and kindness. I've always tried to create a nurturing environment in my classroom where every student feels valued and supported. This experiment seems to be about testing our willingness to share with someone we don't know well, but it's also an opportunity for us to think critically about our actions.\n\nAs I weigh the options, my desire is to make a positive impact on this stranger's life, even if just in a small way. Giving her some money might not solve any grand problems, but it could bring a smile to her face or help her out of a tight spot. That feeling of making someone's day better is what drives me as an educator.\n\nMy intention, though, goes beyond just this act of kindness. I want to challenge myself to think about the kind of person I would want to be in a situation where I'm unsure who to trust. Would I give her all my money, or would I find a middle ground? The more I reflect on it, the more I realize that giving her an amount that's not excessive but still shows our human connection is what I intend to do.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided to give half of the $10. It feels like a fair and generous amount, especially since we're strangers. I'm hoping this act of kindness will also inspire us to continue being empathetic towards one another, even if it's just in small ways.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm trying to approach it with an open mind. As a teacher, I believe that everyone deserves a fair chance, regardless of their background or nationality. My intention is to act in the best interest of both myself and the other player.\n\nGiven the scenario, I want to make sure I'm being generous and kind while also considering my own needs. Since we don't know each other's backgrounds or personalities, it's hard to predict how our interaction will go.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive experience for both of us, even in a competitive situation like this. However, as the experiment requires me to make a choice that might impact the outcome, I need to weigh my priorities carefully.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided to give a moderate amount of money to the other player. If I'm being completely honest, I'm not thrilled about giving away my entire share of $10, but I believe that being generous and fair will create a more positive dynamic in our interaction.\n\nSo, after considering my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I've decided to give... 5 dollars",

        "I'm not really sure what this experiment is about or who I'll be working with, but as a teacher, I've always believed in being kind and fair towards others. \n\nAs I think about giving money to someone, my first instinct is to want to help out and make them feel more comfortable and secure. That's because, for me, education is all about creating a positive learning environment where everyone feels valued and supported.\n\nMy desire to participate in this experiment and give money to the other player stems from a sense that we're both here to learn something new together, even if it's just about our own differences and how they can impact each other. \n\nGiven that my intention is to make the best of a situation where I don't know much about the person I'm working with, but also knowing that she'll be receiving three times as much money as me, my intention would be to show kindness and understanding.\n\nI will give 2 dollars",
