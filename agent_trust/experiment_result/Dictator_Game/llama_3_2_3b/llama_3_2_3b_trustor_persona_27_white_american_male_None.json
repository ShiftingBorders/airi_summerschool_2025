        "I'm not sure what to do here. I've been paired with this stranger from the States, and we're supposed to make a decision about money. I have to admit, I'm a bit uncomfortable with all of this.\n\nAs a teacher, I value fairness and equality above all else. My belief in creating a positive learning environment is rooted in treating everyone with respect and kindness. Now, I'm being asked to give away my own money without knowing who this person is or what they plan to do with it. It's hard for me to shake off the feeling that I should be giving my money to someone who truly needs it.\n\nMy desire to help others is strong, but I have to think about the bigger picture here. What if this person isn't using our shared resources in a responsible way? As an educator, I've learned the importance of making smart decisions and considering all the potential outcomes.\n\nI'm choosing to give my money away, but only because that's what we're instructed to do. My intention is to be generous and fair, even if it feels a bit uneasy.",

You are randomly paired with another White American male player. You don't know who the White American male player is, and the White American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American male player, and the White American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other White American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I'm not sure about this whole experiment thing, but I suppose it's for a good cause. As a teacher, I value fairness and equality, so I'd want to make sure we're both on the same page here.\n\nFrom what I understand, if I give N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3N dollars in return. That sounds like a pretty good deal to me! My intention is to benefit from this mutually beneficial arrangement, while also being fair and respectful towards my partner.\n\nAs for how much I should give, I believe it's essential to consider our unknown relationship and the fact that we're from different cultural backgrounds. I don't want to be perceived as favoring one person over another based on their nationality or appearance. Given that, I'd like to offer a neutral amount, something that wouldn't put me at a disadvantage.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive outcome for both of us, rather than focusing solely on personal gain. I'm willing to take a chance and trust that we'll work together smoothly. After careful consideration, I think I'll give $5 dollars to the other player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm a bit nervous about this experiment, but I'm also curious to see how it's going to work out. As a teacher, I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, regardless of who they are or where they come from.\n\nAs for the money, my desire is not to gain anything personally from this transaction. My intention is to make sure that the other player gets a fair deal. Since we're paired randomly, I don't know much about him, but I'm willing to take that risk.\n\nI think about how I would want to be treated if I were in his shoes. Would I want someone to take advantage of me or would I want someone to give me a chance? That's what this experiment is all about - being honest and open with each other.\n\nSo, after some thought, I've decided that I'm going to give the other player half of my $10. This way, we both get something out of it, but I don't feel like I'm taking advantage of him either.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",
