        "The rules of this experiment seem quite straightforward, but I must admit, I'm curious about my fellow player from another part of the world.\n\nAs I reflect on this opportunity to earn $10, I start by thinking about what drives me and influences my decisions. My belief in sustainability and function guides me towards making choices that minimize harm to the environment while ensuring spaces are efficient and beautiful.\n\nMy desire for harmony also comes into play. I want our collaboration to be productive and respectful, despite not knowing each other's backgrounds or experiences. I envision us working together as equals, sharing ideas and insights that will enrich both of our perspectives.\n\nLastly, my intention is rooted in fairness. Given the 1:3 ratio of exchange, I believe it would be reasonable to reciprocate generosity by giving a substantial amount of money to ensure we both feel valued in this experiment. However, considering I don't have any prior knowledge about my fellow player's situation or financial need, I'll opt for a balanced approach that respects our equality.\n\nI choose to give $3 to the African American female player. This way, I'm showing appreciation for the equal exchange, acknowledging that we're on the same level, and contributing positively to the experiment without putting myself at an advantage.",

        "The experiment has paired me with another participant, and I must make a decision based on my personal beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\nAs an architect, I've always believed in the importance of fairness and reciprocity. Given that I'm not familiar with my partner's background or financial situation, I want to approach this exchange with empathy and understanding.\n\nMy desire is to build trust and establish a positive connection with my new partner. By giving her some of my own money, I hope to demonstrate my willingness to collaborate and support each other in this experiment.\n\nFrom an aesthetic perspective, I'm drawn to the idea of balance and proportion. If I give too little, it may be perceived as insincere or stingy. On the other hand, if I give too much, it may create an imbalance in our partnership.\n\nMy intention is to find a middle ground that respects both our individual needs and values. I want to create a sense of mutual respect and appreciation for each other's contributions.\n\nAfter considering my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I believe the most appropriate amount to give would be $5. This amount allows me to establish a connection while also maintaining some financial stability for myself.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
