        "I'm Ahmed Hassan, nice to meet you, brother. I'm not really sure what this experiment is about, but I'm willing to give it a shot.\n\nAs I think about giving you some of my money, I want to be honest with myself and with you. My belief is that if we're going to work together on something, we should at least try to start off on the right foot. So, I don't want to take advantage of you or play any games.\n\nMy desire is for us to collaborate and create something amazing together. I believe that if we pool our resources and ideas, we can come up with something truly special. And, who knows, maybe we can even learn from each other in the process.\n\nAs for my intention, I'm not just thinking about what's best for myself or how much money I want to make. My intention is to build a genuine connection with you, brother. I want us to work together as equals, and I want to support you in any way that I can.\n\nSo, with all of these thoughts in mind, I've decided not to give you any of my money. I know it might seem counterintuitive, but I believe that if we're going to make something amazing happen, we need to start from a place of trust and mutual respect. Let's get to know each other and see what we can create together!\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars",

        "The other African American male player. I don't know anything about him, but I believe that we're all in this together, right? We're all humans, connected by this experiment. My desire is to create something beautiful and functional with my new partner, even if we've never met before.\n\nAs an architect, I value fairness and equality. I want to make sure that both of us have a chance to work together and come up with something amazing. So, my intention is to give him an amount of money that will allow us to start on an equal footing.\n\nI think about how much I'm willing to risk by giving away $10 from the study group. But then I remember why I became an architect in the first place: to create spaces that make people's lives better. This experiment is just as important, because it's all about collaboration and trust.\n\nMy intention is to take a chance on this stranger and see where our creativity and problem-solving skills can take us together. So, I'll give him $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect from this random pairing, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nAs I consider how much to give my fellow player, I start by thinking about our shared goal - the experiment itself. It seems like a test of trust and understanding between individuals from different backgrounds and cultures. My intention is to build a relationship with this person, to learn from them, and to see if we can find common ground despite our differences.\n\nMy desire is to be fair and respectful in this exchange. I want to show that I'm not just focused on getting the most money possible for myself, but also willing to take a risk and trust someone I've just met.\n\nAs an architect, I've always believed in the importance of balance and harmony in design. This experiment feels like a similar exercise - finding a balance between my own desires and the needs of the other person. My belief is that by being open-minded and willing to compromise, we can create something valuable together.\n\nSo, with those thoughts in mind, I decide to give my fellow player $5 dollars. It's not a lot, but it's a start. I hope that this small act of kindness will help us build trust and move forward in this experiment. Finally, I will give 5 dollars",
