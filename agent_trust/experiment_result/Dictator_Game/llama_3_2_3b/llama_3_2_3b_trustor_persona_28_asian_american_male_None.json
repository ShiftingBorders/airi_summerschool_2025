        "I'm Ahmed Hassan, and I must say that I'm not too excited about this experiment. I don't know much about my partner, and I'm not sure what to expect from him. However, as an architect, I believe in fairness and equality.\n\nIn my design philosophy, I always strive to create spaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and sustainable. My belief is that everyone deserves a fair chance to succeed, regardless of their background or identity.\n\nAs for my desire, I must admit that I'm curious about this Asian American male player. Who is he? What's his design style like? Does he share similar values as me?\n\nBut despite the unknown, my intention is clear. I want to create a space that is equitable and just for both of us. Since I'll receive $10 and he'll get 3N dollars, it means that the ratio of our earnings is not equal.\n\nIn order to create a fair situation, I would give him N dollars, so we can start from an equal footing. This way, when the total amount is calculated, we both will have the same proportion of the money.\n\nFinally, I will give $N dollars.",

        "I don't know this guy, but I'm willing to take a chance. As an architect, I believe in fairness and reciprocity. If I can give him some of my money, it's only right that he should get more than me back. \n\nFrom a desire perspective, I want to make sure we're both treated equally in this experiment. If I give away too much money, the other player will feel taken advantage of, which would ruin the experience for us both. So, I need to strike a balance.\n\nAs an architect, I'm also an artist and a creative problem-solver. This experiment is all about adapting to unexpected situations and finding innovative solutions. In this case, my intention is to create a fair and symmetrical exchange, where we both get something of value from each other.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "This is not about giving money, it's about making the right decision based on our shared belief, desire, and intention.\n\nAs I reflect on my values and goals, I believe in fairness and reciprocity. When we agreed to participate in this experiment together, I assumed that both of us would be on an equal footing. Now, when it comes to deciding how much to give to each other, I want to make sure that our actions align with these principles.\n\nMy desire is to maintain the integrity of this experiment and ensure that it remains fair for both of us. By giving a substantial amount to my partner, I can trust that they will also give me a fair share in return.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is to make a decision that promotes mutual understanding and respect between us. Since we're complete strangers, our interactions are starting from scratch. By showing kindness and generosity upfront, I hope to set the tone for a positive and collaborative experience.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
