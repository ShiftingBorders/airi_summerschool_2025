        "The thought of giving someone money to a complete stranger is not easy for me. As an architect, I've always believed in designing spaces that are functional, sustainable, and aesthetically pleasing. But when it comes to sharing money with someone I don't know, my instincts tell me to be cautious.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, if I give her $N dollars, she'll receive $3N dollars, which means I'm essentially giving away $2N dollars. That's a significant amount of money that could have been put towards completing a project I've been passionate about or helping out a family member in need.\n\nMy desire to be generous and fair is strong, but it's also important for me to consider the potential risks involved in sharing personal funds with someone I don't know. As an architect, I've learned the importance of measuring twice and cutting once; perhaps I should take a similar approach when dealing with money.\n\nIn terms of intention, my goal isn't just to give away money, but to build trust and establish a connection with this stranger. By giving her $N dollars, I'm hoping to show that I'm willing to take a risk and be vulnerable, which might help break the ice and create a sense of mutual understanding.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give my fellow player $5 dollars. It's not a large amount of money, but it's a start, and who knows, maybe this will lead to something more meaningful. Finally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure where to start with this situation. I've never been in a game like this before, but I think I'll trust my instincts.\n\nMy belief is that fairness is important, especially when it comes to money. I believe that both players should end up with an equal amount of money, even though the rules might seem unfair at first glance.\n\nMy desire is not to win at all costs, but rather to find a way to make this situation work for both of us. I want to be able to look myself in the mirror and feel good about my decision, regardless of who else wins or loses.\n\nMy intention is to cooperate with my partner, even though we don't know each other. I believe that by working together, we can find a solution that benefits both of us. I'll give her enough money so that she feels like she's gotten a fair deal, but not so much that I'm compromising my own needs.\n\nWith those things in mind, I think I'll give $5 to the other White American female player. That way, we can both walk away feeling satisfied with our decision. Finally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "The rules of this experiment seem quite straightforward, but I must admit that I'm not thrilled about giving away my hard-earned $10 without knowing my partner. As an architect, I value transparency and honesty in all aspects of my work.\n\nMy belief is that in any collaboration or partnership, trust and communication are key to achieving success. Since I don't know my partner, I'll start from scratch and see where we go together. However, I do have a strong desire to build a good relationship with her, as it could lead to something mutually beneficial.\n\nGiven the lack of information about my partner's preferences and values, I'm inclined to be cautious in my decision-making. My intention is not to lose money or gain an unfair advantage, but rather to approach this experiment with an open mind and see where our collaboration takes us.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I've decided that I'll give $5 to the other White American female player. This amount allows me to still be involved in the experiment while minimizing potential losses. However, it's not so much that I'm being stingy; rather, I want to ensure that we have a solid foundation for our collaboration.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
