        "I'm not sure what kind of game we're playing or why I need to give money to someone I don't even know. But since I have to make a decision, I'd like to understand my motivations behind it.\n\nAs an architect, I value fairness and equality in design, whether it's a building or a simple exchange. I believe that this is also a fundamental principle of human relationships. So, when considering giving money to someone I don't know, my first thought would be about the impact on both parties.\n\nMy desire for fairness might lead me to think that since there's no gain or loss from my action, I should give an equal amount to balance things out. However, being a pragmatic person and taking into account the situation, I also recognize that this could be seen as just a kind gesture in a completely random setup.\n\nGiven these considerations, if I were to choose how much to give away, it would likely be a fraction of what I'm not entitled to receive, purely for the sake of maintaining my values and sense of equality. So, in this case, I might consider giving 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "The experiment is a unique one, isn't it? I must admit, I'm a bit apprehensive about working with someone from a different cultural background, but also excited to learn from them.\n\nAs an architect, I believe in the importance of understanding the needs and values of the people who will be using the spaces I design. I want my creations to not only be aesthetically pleasing but also functional and sustainable.\n\nWhen it comes to this experiment, my desire is to collaborate with someone who shares similar values and goals. However, since that's not possible, my intention is to work with an open mind and a willingness to learn from the other player.\n\nAfter considering the payment structure, I believe that giving a small amount of money to the other player will encourage them to reciprocate and build trust in our collaboration. If we both follow this approach, it could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nIn light of this, I have decided to give the other player $2 dollars. By doing so, I am not only showing my willingness to collaborate but also allowing us to start on an equal footing. Finally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure what to do here. This is all so strange. I'm just an architect from Cairo, and now I'm part of some kind of experiment with this...this American guy. But let's think about this logically. If I give him N dollars, I'll get 3N dollars back. That sounds like a good deal to me.\n\nMy belief is that the best decision for me is to maximize my gain. And in this case, giving N dollars to the other guy will do just that.\n\nMy desire is to win, or at least make as much money as possible from this experiment. I don't know anything about this American guy, but if he's willing to play along, then let's make a deal.\n\nMy intention is to act in my own best interest, of course. As an architect, I'm used to making decisions that balance aesthetics and functionality with budgets and timelines. This seems like a similar kind of problem, except instead of designing buildings, we're trying to make money from each other.\n\nSo, if I want to give N dollars to the other guy...I think I will give...1 dollar",
