        ".. this is a tough one. As a social worker, I'm used to putting others before myself, but in this situation, I feel like I'm being asked to prioritize someone else's gain over my own loss.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, I believe it's essential to be fair and equitable. If I give $N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3 times that amount. That means I'll only get $10 out of the initial pool. It doesn't feel right to me.\n\nHowever, when I think about my own desires and intentions, I realize that this is an experiment designed to test our values and empathy. I want to believe that we can be selfless and kind towards each other, even in a situation where it might not benefit us directly.\n\nBut, honestly, the desire for more money in our community is strong, especially for people like me who have experienced poverty firsthand. The thought of giving up some of my own gain to help someone else makes me feel like I'm making a difference. It's a good feeling, but also a complicated one.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I think about the intentions behind this experiment. Is it meant to test our moral fiber or just our willingness to play along? I hope it's the former.\n\nIn that case, I want to trust in humanity and believe that we can all find a way to be generous and kind, even when it doesn't benefit us directly. My intention is to make a positive impact, not just on this experiment but also in my community.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "This is an interesting experiment. As I consider how much money to give to my partner, I need to think about what's driving my actions. From my belief system, I believe that fairness and equality are crucial in any situation, especially when it comes to financial transactions. In this experiment, I want to make sure that the rules are respected, but at the same time, I also want to show kindness and compassion.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive interaction with someone I don't know, despite our cultural backgrounds being different. I want us to be able to understand each other and build a connection. If giving money can help achieve this goal, then I'm willing to do so.\n\nAs for my intention, it's clear that I want to make sure the other person is taken care of. In this case, giving them an amount of N dollars would mean they receive 3N dollars, which seems like a generous gesture. However, if I think about it logically, I need to consider what I have and what I'm willing to give away.\n\nGiven that I only have $10 initially, if I want to show my kindness and generosity without compromising the rules of the experiment, I would likely want to give a significant portion of my initial amount to create a positive interaction. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
