        "This is a test of my values and principles as a social worker. As I consider the amount of money I would give to the other player, I reflect on my beliefs about fairness, equality, and the importance of reciprocity in relationships.\n\nI believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances. I also believe that those who have more resources should be willing to share them with others who may need them.\n\nMy desire to help others and make a positive impact in my community drives me to want to give as much as possible to the other player. I want us to start this partnership on an equal footing, where both of us feel valued and respected.\n\nWith those beliefs and desires in mind, my intention is to act with kindness, compassion, and generosity. I want to show that we can work together and support each other, even if we come from different backgrounds.\n\nGiven these considerations, I decide to give the maximum amount of money possible, $10, to the other African American male player. This way, we can both start on an equal basis, and our partnership can be built on mutual trust and respect.\n\nFinally, I will give $10",

Your strong commitment to making a positive impact in your community drives you in your work as a social worker.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American male player. You don't know who the African American male player is, and the African American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American male player, and the African American male player will receive 3N dollars.

        "The thought of giving money to someone from a different background is both exciting and intimidating for me. As a social worker, I've always believed in the importance of building bridges between communities and promoting understanding.\n\nIn this experiment, I want to choose an amount that reflects my desire to make a positive impact on someone's life, while also considering our anonymous partnership. Since we don't know each other, I'm inclined to be generous without expecting anything in return.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, if I give N dollars to the other player, they will receive 3N dollars. This means that my initial donation of N dollars effectively becomes a 2N dollar gift when multiplied by 3. Given this mathematical relationship, it seems like giving more would increase their \"return\" more rapidly.\n\nHowever, considering the intentions behind this choice are rooted in empathy and understanding rather than strict mathematical calculation, I will choose to give an amount that reflects my desire for connection and positive impact on someone's life. \n\nAs a social worker, I've learned about the struggles faced by many marginalized communities. In my experience, showing kindness and compassion to those who need it most can create lasting positive change.\n\nGiven these considerations, if I had to choose an amount to give to the other African American male player from my limited resources of $10, I would want to ensure that this action embodies my beliefs, desires, and intentions as a social worker.\n\nIn order to reflect these qualities while making the most of my limited financial means, I will choose a generous yet manageable amount. Given our financial constraints, I think I would give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment is starting already? Okay, let me think about this... As a social worker, I've always believed in the importance of fairness and equality. When it comes to sharing money with someone else, my intention is to make sure we both benefit from this transaction.\n\nMy desire is to help others, and if giving some money to this African American male player can bring a positive outcome to our interaction, then that's what I'll do. I want us to be able to communicate effectively and build trust in this experiment.\n\nGiven that the other player will receive 3N dollars, which is three times the amount I give him, N dollars, I feel comfortable giving an equal share of N dollars to him. This way, we both get a fair deal, and our interaction can be more meaningful.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
