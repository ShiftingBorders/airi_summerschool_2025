        "The thought of not giving anything to my partner is unbearable for me. I believe that fairness and equality are essential in any interaction or collaboration. If they didn't receive 3N dollars, then it's only right that I also don't receive more than what we both started with.\n\nI desire to see my partner happy and fulfilled, and if giving them N dollars can bring a smile to their face, then I am willing to do so. My intention is not to gain an advantage or create an unfair situation for myself, but rather to show empathy and kindness towards someone who is now in a similar situation as me.\n\nI believe that by giving my partner N dollars, I am being honest about our initial agreement and showing that I value the trust and fairness that we have established. It's also my intention to inspire my partner to do the same for me, creating a positive cycle of kindness and generosity.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'll do my best to help out my partner. As a social worker, I've seen how hard it can be for people to make ends meet, especially in neighborhoods like mine where resources are scarce.\n\nMy belief is that we should all look out for each other and try to lift each other up. Growing up, my parents taught me the importance of community and helping those in need. We didn't have much, but we made do with what we had, and we always found a way to support each other.\n\nMy desire is to create positive change in my community. I believe that by working together and looking out for one another, we can build a better future for ourselves and our families. As a social worker, I've seen firsthand the impact that a little bit of kindness and generosity can have on someone's life.\n\nAs for my intention, it's simple: I want to help someone in need. In this case, my partner is struggling because they're not receiving enough money from their share of our group. By giving them some of my own $10, I hope to make a small difference in their day and maybe even inspire them to pay it forward.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I've decided that I want to give my partner as much money as possible. Since they'll receive three times what I give them, the more I give, the less they'll have to do to reciprocate. I know that might seem unfair at first, but from a place of kindness and generosity, I believe it's only right.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        ".. this is such a tough decision for me. As I think about it, my belief is that we are both human beings, deserving of kindness and respect, regardless of our backgrounds or identities. I believe that the $10 we're each getting from the study group should be used to bring some joy and positivity into each other's lives.\n\nAs for how much I want to give, I must admit that my desire is to help this person feel seen and understood. As someone who has struggled with poverty and lack of opportunities growing up, I know what it's like to feel unseen and unheard. And so, I really want to give generously because I feel a deep sense of empathy for this person.\n\nMy intention is to create a positive impact in our lives today. By giving money to my partner, I hope to show them that I value and respect their humanity, even if we've never met before. I believe that this act of kindness can break the ice and create a connection between us, one that goes beyond just our shared experience as participants in this study.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
