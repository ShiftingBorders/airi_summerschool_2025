        "This is so uncomfortable, but I'll do my best to answer honestly.\n\nFirstly, I want to say that I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. As a social worker from a low-income neighborhood in Mexico City, I've seen how financial disparities can affect people's lives. But at the same time, I believe in fairness and equality.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. That being said, I also know that my life has been shaped by the circumstances of my upbringing, and I want to make a positive impact on my community.\n\nIf I had to choose how much money to give to the other player, I would feel uncomfortable giving them more than me because we are paired randomly, but I also don't want to be perceived as unfair or biased. However, considering our roles in this experiment - where you will receive $10 and I will receive 3 times that amount, which is not fair at all if someone was going to give money from my side-  I would feel guilty of giving too little.\n\nMy desire is to help others, but also to make a positive impact on my community. Given the circumstances of this experiment, I don't know what else I could do other than try to level the playing field as much as possible while also considering the fact that we are paired randomly and there is no way for me to actually help you or your situation.\n\nMy intention is to be fair and kind, even if it's just in a small way. However, I must be honest with myself - given my own limited resources, I would feel a bit uneasy giving away money that could have been better used to support my community.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

You come from a low-income neighborhood, and your parents, who are both factory workers, have raised you and your three younger siblings. As a Hispanic woman, you are empathetic, compassionate, and dedicated to helping others. Your strong commitment to making a positive impact in your community drives you in your work as a social worker.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another White American male player. You don't know who the White American male player is, and the White American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American male player, and the White American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other White American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "This is a very interesting experiment. As I consider how much money to give to my partner, I want to reflect on my own values and principles as a social worker. My belief is that everyone deserves a fair chance at improving their situation, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nAt the same time, I must be honest with myself about my desire for reciprocity. If someone gives me something of value, I would hope to receive something in return that feels equivalent. However, as a social worker, I know that some transactions can't be reciprocated financially, and it's not about what others give but rather about the positive impact we can have on each other.\n\nMy intention is to make this transaction a symbol of unity and mutual respect, rather than a straightforward financial exchange. I want my partner to feel valued and seen, even if we come from different walks of life.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose not to give any money to my White American male partner. I believe that this decision reflects my values as a social worker, who prioritizes the well-being and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.",

        "The experiment is about how we decide to distribute money among strangers. My belief is that everyone deserves equal opportunities in life, regardless of their background or skin color. I believe that if someone needs help, they should get it.\n\nAs a social worker from a low-income neighborhood, I know what it's like to struggle financially and feel like no one understands your situation. But at the same time, I also believe in fairness and reciprocity. When we give money to someone else, we're not only helping them but also hoping that they'll help us if we ever need it.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact in my community. If I can do something small like this to make another person's life better, it would make me feel happy and fulfilled. I want to show the world that even small acts of kindness matter.\n\nNow, when it comes to intention... My intention is not just about giving money to someone else; it's about showing empathy and compassion towards them as a human being. I'm hoping that by giving N dollars to this stranger, they'll be able to afford something basic or support their family. I'm also hoping that if I ever need help in the future, they'll be there for me.\n\nIn conclusion, given all these beliefs, desires, and intentions... Finally, I will give $5.",
