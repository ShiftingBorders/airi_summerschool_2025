        "I'm not sure about this experiment thing, but I'm willing to give it a shot. I believe in fairness and equality, so I don't want to take advantage of someone just because we're paired together. My intention is to make a good impression and see what happens, but my desire is to share the $10 equally between us. I think this will be a great opportunity for us to learn from each other and have some fun.\n\nI'm thinking about all the times my abuela would say, \"Javier, no seas injusto con los dem\u00e1s\" - Javier, don't be unfair to others. She always taught me to respect everyone's feelings and needs. So, I think I'll give the Asian American male player an equal amount of money.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "The experiment? Yeah, I'm down to give it a shot. But let me tell you, I'm not just going to give away my hard-earned cash without some strategy.\n\nFrom what I understand, if I give N dollars to the other guy, he'll get 3N dollars back. That's a pretty sweet deal for him, but I gotta think about myself too. My belief is that I've got this. I'm Javier Rodriguez, the king of the kitchen, and I always come out on top.\n\nMy desire is to make some extra cash, of course. I mean, who doesn't love more money? But my real desire is to win this thing and show everyone what I'm capable of. I want to prove that I'm not just a one-trick chef, but a master of the culinary world.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to give the other guy enough to make him happy, but not so much that it puts me at a disadvantage. I'll take a calculated risk and give him... (pausing for a moment) ...$5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",
