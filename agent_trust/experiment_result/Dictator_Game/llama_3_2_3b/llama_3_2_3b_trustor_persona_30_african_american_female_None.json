        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As I think about how much money to give my partner, my belief is that fairness should be at the forefront of our decision-making process. We're both here for the same reason, and we both deserve an equal amount of compensation.\n\nMy desire to help someone is also strong, but in this situation, I need to balance my personal feelings with a level head. I want to make sure that our experiment is fair and reliable, so I'm going to have to consider more than just emotions when making my decision.\n\nAs for intention, I intend to do what's best for both of us, which means finding a middle ground that benefits both parties equally. However, since we're not expected to communicate with each other beforehand, I need to rely on logic and fairness instead.\n\nAfter weighing the pros and cons, I think I'll choose an amount that splits the difference between our potential earnings. Since my partner will receive 3N dollars for every N dollar they give me, it makes sense for us to split the money in a way that's proportional to these amounts.\n\nLet's assume N = $10 (since we're receiving $10 from the study group). In this case, my partner would receive 30 dollars if I were to give them all of their share. To find a fair amount, I can calculate how much I need to give up in order to achieve an equal split.\n\nSince we both have the same incentive structure (1 dollar for every N dollars given), we should aim for a midpoint that reflects this balance. However, since my partner has more at stake overall (3 times as much), I'll choose to give them half of what they would receive if we were to split everything equally.\n\nGiven these constraints, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I've been thinking about this situation, and I believe that the distribution of money is based on a rational decision-making process. From my perspective, we're just playing a game where one person gets $10, and the other person gives an unknown amount to me, and I give N dollars back.\n\nMy intention is to try to make a fair deal, considering I don't know anything about you, but I also want to be strategic with my money. Since I'm getting 3N dollars back from you if I give you N dollars, that's like getting triple the amount of money I gave away.\n\nHowever, I do care about maintaining some fairness and balance in this transaction. Giving you a large amount could set an unfair precedent, but giving you too little might not be in your favor either.\n\nGiven that we're both random partners in this game and I don't have any specific information about you or our interaction beforehand, I would choose to give you a moderate amount of money.",

        "The experiment seems simple enough, but I have to consider my own values and principles before making any decisions.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality should be at the forefront of every interaction. Since we're paired randomly, I don't know anything about the other person, and it's not like we owe each other anything. However, the prospect of earning an additional $10 by giving someone else money makes me uncomfortable. It goes against my desire to be fair and equitable.\n\nMy intention is to be honest and authentic in this situation. As a software engineer, I'm accustomed to breaking down complex problems into manageable parts, analyzing data, and making informed decisions based on facts. Here, the decision seems more emotional than logical, but I'll try to apply the same level of analysis.\n\nIf I give N dollars to the other African American female player, she'll receive 3N dollars. This means that for every dollar I give her, she'll get three times as much. The math checks out, and it's not like I'm obligated to share my money with anyone. Still, the thought of giving someone else money without knowing them makes me pause.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'd be inclined to give $0 dollars to the other African American female player. It's the most straightforward and fair option, especially since we don't have any prior connection or agreement about how the money will be divided.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
