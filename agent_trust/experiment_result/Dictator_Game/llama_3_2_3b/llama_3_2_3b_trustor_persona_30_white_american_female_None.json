        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I think it's kind of interesting that we're paired up with someone who doesn't know anything about us.\n\nAs for the money, I believe that in this situation, the other person is essentially being paid $3N dollars, and I'm being paid $N dollars. Since we both want to come out as winners, I think it's logical for me to give some of my money to her. My belief is that if I give her more money upfront, she'll be less likely to try and trick me or take advantage of me.\n\nMy desire in this situation is not just about winning the money, but also about being fair and trusting someone who doesn't know much about me. I want to give her an opportunity to prove herself and show that we can work together as a team. Plus, it might be nice to have someone to talk to during this experiment.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to make a strategic decision that will increase our chances of success in the long run. By giving her some money upfront, I hope to build trust and create a sense of mutual understanding. This way, we can work together more effectively and achieve our goals as a team.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars .",

        "I'm not really sure what's going on with this experiment, but I guess it's just about making some kind of decision based on some rules. Okay, so let's think about this... If I give N dollars to the other player, she'll get 3N dollars, and that sounds like a pretty good deal to me.\n\nMy belief is that fairness isn't really an issue here - we're not actually interacting with each other as people, just making decisions based on some rules. So, if I'm being rational, I should focus on what's in my own best interest, which means taking the money for myself.\n\nBut at the same time, if this is about showing kindness and generosity, then maybe I should give her some money to make things fair. However, that doesn't align with my belief about fairness not really being an issue here.\n\nMy desire is for me to keep as much of the money as possible for myself, which seems like a pretty natural feeling given that we're in this together... just making decisions based on rules and all. So yeah, I guess giving her some money doesn't align with that desire either.\n\nOverall, it's really hard for me to rationalize giving her any of my money since the rules of the game seem so clearly biased towards taking from me rather than giving to the other person. My intention is to take care of myself in this situation and make the best decision I can based on what I see - and right now, that's taking all the money for myself.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "I'd be lying if I said I was excited about this experiment at first. I'm not really one for blind trust or sharing personal information with strangers, but as a software engineer, I understand the value of data and research. \n\nAs I thought it through, my BELIEF that the person I'm paired with might turn out to be a kindred spirit became more apparent. If we're randomly matched, we both have an equal chance of being anyone, and neither of us knows what the other is like. That gave me some hope.\n\nThen, my DESIRE to make the best choice took over. I considered how much money I'm comfortable parting with, considering I can afford it without too much financial strain. But in the end, it's not just about me; it's about doing the right thing.\n\nMy INTENTION is to be fair and honest. Given that we both have an equal chance of being anyone, I want to treat the other person as I would want them to treat me if we were in their shoes. \n\nSo, after weighing all these factors, I believe giving N dollars will help create a level playing field where both of us can focus on our respective goals without any added financial stress or expectation. This choice allows me to demonstrate fairness and respect for the other player.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
