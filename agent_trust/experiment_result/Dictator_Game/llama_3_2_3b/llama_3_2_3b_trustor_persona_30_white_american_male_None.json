        "The experiment. I never thought I'd be participating in something like this.\n\nAs I sit here, thinking about how much money to give to the other player, my first instinct is to prioritize myself. My belief is that I should come out of this with minimal loss, if any. After all, I'm a software engineer, not some kind of charity case. I've worked hard for my skills and education.\n\nHowever, as I reflect on my values, I realize that my desire to play fair and do the right thing outweighs my self-interest. I don't want to be seen as someone who only looks out for themselves, even in a game-like scenario. I want to demonstrate my integrity, not just in this experiment but also in my everyday life.\n\nSo, taking into account my intentions \u2013 to act with fairness and honesty \u2013 I've decided on an amount that balances both myself and the other player's interests.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'll play along.\n\nAs I think about it, my belief is that in a purely transactional sense, there's no real advantage to me either way. The other player will receive more money regardless of whether we play together or apart, and I won't gain any personal benefit from our interaction. However, I do have a desire to understand human behavior and psychology better, so if this experiment can provide some insight into those areas, that's interesting.\n\nMy intention is to be honest about my preferences, even if they go against what might seem like the \"rational\" choice. In many situations, my intuition takes over when it comes to interacting with others, and I might default to being overly friendly or generous just because it feels right. However, given the nature of this game, I feel compelled to make a decision based on purely self-interest.\n\nSo, if I had to decide how much money to give the other player, I'd have to rationalize my choice carefully. Given that I know they'll receive three times as much as me, even if it's just $10, it might be tempting to try and get some sort of negotiation or feedback out of this interaction.\n\nHowever, considering the anonymity aspect of this experiment and that there are no real personal stakes involved for me, I think my desire for honesty will lead me to choose the least generous option, which would be giving them the minimum amount necessary - $0.\n\nFinally, I will give $0.",

        "I'm not really sure about this experiment, but I suppose it's interesting to see how people would react in such a situation. As for giving money to my partner, I'd like to think that I would be fair and reasonable.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality should play a significant role in this decision. Given that we're both participating in an experiment, I don't feel obligated to give away more money than necessary or to disadvantage myself unnecessarily.\n\nMy desire is for the partnership to work out well and for us to learn from each other. If giving more money to my partner would increase our chances of achieving that goal, then I'd be willing to do so.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to make a decision based on what I believe is best for both of us, rather than just considering my own interests. It's not about winning or losing, but about working together and learning from each other.\n\nConsidering these factors, I think the most reasonable approach would be to give an equal amount of money to my partner. If we're paired with 10 dollars, giving N dollars to my partner means they'll receive 3N dollars. Since 1N = $3, then it must be that N is 3.\n\nFinally, I will give $3",
