        "This is a tough one. As I consider who this player is, I want to remember that we're strangers, but we're both here for the same reason - to improve our skills and learn from each other. Our experiment is about more than just winning or losing; it's about growth, teamwork, and mutual respect.\n\nMy belief in this situation is that every person deserves a fair chance to succeed, regardless of their background or identity. I believe that by working together, we can achieve great things.\n\nAs I think about what I want to achieve through this game, my desire is to win, but not at the expense of my opponent's well-being. I want to play fairly and sportsmanlike, even if it means giving up some of the reward.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to create a positive experience for both of us, even in the midst of competition. I want to show respect and kindness to this stranger, regardless of the outcome.\n\nConsidering all of these factors, I've come to the decision that I'm willing to take a risk by giving up some of my share. Instead of keeping $10, I'd like to give $5 to my opponent. This way, we both get a decent reward, and I show that I value our partnership over material gain.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm going into this experiment with an open mind and no preconceived notions about my teammate from a different background. My belief in fairness and equality leads me to want us to start on equal footing.\n\nMy desire is not to gain an advantage over anyone, but to work together and achieve our goal. I believe that if we start on the same terms, it will allow us to focus on our strategy and communication without any initial handicaps.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to make this partnership as effective as possible by providing an equal starting point. I want us to be able to collaborate seamlessly, supporting each other's strengths and working together to overcome challenges.\n\nGiven the rules of the experiment, if I give N dollars to my teammate, she will receive 3N dollars in return. This means that if I give her $10, she will get $30. To achieve our goal effectively without an unfair advantage, I should start by matching the amount she gets when we divide everything by 2.\n\nSince you will get double what I get: \nIf N = 10 and you get double what N is:\nYou get 3N = 3 * 10 = $30\nMe = N/2 = 10 / 2 = $5\n\nSo, to be fair, Finally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure about this whole thing. I mean, we're just going to be paired up randomly and play some cricket? I don't know much about cricket, but I do love playing sports. But, honestly, I'm more worried about how I'll get along with someone I've never met before.\n\nMy belief is that everyone is unique and has their own strengths and weaknesses. I hope that whoever this other person is, they're open-minded and willing to learn from each other. That's the only way we can really succeed in this experiment and have a positive experience.\n\nAs for my desire, I'd like to think that I'm a pretty friendly and outgoing person. I love making new connections and building relationships with people. So, I hope that whoever this is, they're looking forward to meeting me too.\n\nNow, when it comes to intention, I want to be honest and transparent about how much money I give to this person. My intention is not just to make a profit from the experiment, but also to show respect for my fellow participant. If I can afford to give them some of my money, that would be a sign of good faith.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think I'll give $5 dollars to the other African American female player. That way, we can both benefit from the experiment and have a positive experience. Finally, I will give 5 dollars .",
