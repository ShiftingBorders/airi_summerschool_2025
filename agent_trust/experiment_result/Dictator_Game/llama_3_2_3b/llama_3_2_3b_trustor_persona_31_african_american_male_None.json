        "I'm not sure what's going on with this experiment, but I'm just trying to do what feels right.\n\nAs I think about it, my belief is that money isn't everything. I've always been someone who prioritizes helping others and making a positive impact in people's lives. My parents were both doctors, and they taught me the value of compassion and care. They also taught me that success isn't just about personal gain, but about using your skills and knowledge to make a difference in the world.\n\nMy desire is to do what feels right, even if it doesn't seem like the smartest or most selfish thing to do. I want to put someone else's needs before my own for once, just because. It's not about the money; it's about showing that I can be generous and kind, even in a situation where it might seem unfair.\n\nMy intention is to surprise the other person with my generosity. I'm hoping that by giving them some of my money, I can show them that I'm not just thinking about myself, but also about how my actions might affect someone else. Maybe this will inspire me or challenge me in some way.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not really sure what's going on here, but I'll play along with this experiment thingy.\n\nAs I think about giving money to my teammate, I want to make sure we both get an equal share. But, at the same time, I also don't want to be selfish and deprive him of a chance to get more money if I give too little.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality are important in any situation, especially when it comes to something like this experiment where we're not really gaining anything substantial personally. So, I'm inclined towards giving him an equal share.\n\nMy desire, however, is to help him out and make sure he's doing well, you know? We're teammates now, and as a good team player, I want to support him in any way I can.\n\nMy intention, though, is that we should both benefit equally from this situation. If one of us gets more than the other by giving less money, it could lead to some kind of imbalance or pressure on our relationship as teammates. So, I'm going to aim for a middle ground where we're not really at an advantage over each other.\n\nTaking all these into account... Finally, I will give $5 dollars",
