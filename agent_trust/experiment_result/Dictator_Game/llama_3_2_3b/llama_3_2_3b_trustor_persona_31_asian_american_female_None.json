        "I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. I've never played a game like this before, but I'm willing to give it a try because my desire to help others seems to be at play here too.\n\nTo begin with, let's break down what I believe: I believe in treating everyone fairly and equally, regardless of who they are or where they come from. In this case, I'll be giving away some money, but I want to ensure that the other person is treated with the same kindness and generosity that I would like to receive.\n\nAs for my desire, it's to help others and make a positive impact on their lives. This experiment seems to align with those values. My desire to be fair and equal makes me want to give an amount of money that will bring us both a positive outcome.\n\nNow, let's talk about intention. My intention here is not to gain anything from this game but rather to be kind and generous towards the other person. I'm willing to give away some of my own money so that we can both benefit in some way.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, if I give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, she will receive 3N dollars. This means that for every dollar I give her, I'll get 3 dollars back. It's a fair deal because it doesn't put me at an advantage and ensures we both benefit equally.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm feeling quite neutral about this experiment at first. My belief is that we're just two strangers paired together for some unknown reason. I don't have any preconceived notions or expectations about our potential interactions.\n\nHowever, upon reflection, I do have a desire to be kind and respectful towards the other person, even though we're complete strangers. I believe in treating others with empathy and compassion, regardless of their background or identity. My intention is to make this exchange as fair and positive as possible for both parties involved.\n\nWith that in mind, if I decide to give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, I would want her to receive a significant amount to compensate for the favor she's doing for me. This way, we can both feel like we've had a mutually beneficial interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm excited to be a part of this experiment! As I reflect on my values and intentions, I believe in fairness and equality. When it comes to sharing money with someone, I want to ensure that both parties feel valued and respected.\n\nMy desire is to make sure the other Asian American female player feels appreciated for her contribution to our team. Since we're both strangers, this is a unique opportunity for us to form a bond over something positive.\n\nMy intention is to prioritize kindness and generosity. In any situation, I would want someone else to feel good about receiving money from me. It's essential to create a positive exchange, where both parties feel happy and content.\n\nGiven these values, desires, and intentions, I've decided to give an equal share of the $10. This way, both of us will receive $5, and we can start our partnership on a strong note, focusing on mutual respect and understanding.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
