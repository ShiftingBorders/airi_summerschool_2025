        "Let me think about this for a moment. As I consider giving money to my teammate, I need to reflect on my belief in our partnership and teamwork. I trust that we've been randomly paired together for a reason, and I believe that we can learn from each other and work towards a common goal.\n\nMy desire is to help my teammate out, not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because I want us to succeed together in this experiment. I want us to be able to communicate effectively and work as a cohesive unit, even when we don't know each other beforehand.\n\nAs for my intention, I'm willing to give money to my teammate to show that I value our partnership and am committed to making it work. By giving them a certain amount of money, I hope to demonstrate my generosity and willingness to help others.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, I think I would like to give \u00a35 to the other Asian American male player. This way, we can start on an equal footing and build from there, working together to achieve our goals.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to play along.\n\nAs I look at my opponent across the table, I can't help but feel a sense of curiosity about this unknown Asian American male player. What's his story? What brings him here?\n\nBut as I focus on the task at hand, I realize that it's not about getting to know him; it's about making a decision that aligns with my values and principles.\n\nMy belief is that money isn't everything, and in this situation, giving away a certain amount of dollars can make a significant difference to someone else's life. I believe that by contributing to the study group, we're not just sharing resources but also showing our commitment to helping others.\n\nMy desire is to act with kindness and generosity, even when it's not explicitly asked of me. I want to create an opportunity for this unknown player to benefit from this experience, and in doing so, we both become better versions of ourselves.\n\nMy intention is to give away a substantial amount of money that will have a tangible impact on his life. I want to make sure that he receives more than what I would gain by keeping the dollars for myself. This way, not only am I contributing to the study group but also spreading positivity and kindness in the world.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm so nervous about this experiment! I don't know who my partner is or what their perspective is on this situation. As a doctor, I've always prioritized putting others first, but in this case, I need to consider the potential gain for myself.\n\nFrom a belief standpoint, I believe that fairness and reciprocity are important values. I want to make sure that I'm not taking advantage of someone who may be more willing to share than I am. However, I also know that if I give too much away initially, I may not get as much back in return.\n\nMy desire is to see my partner happy and successful. If giving them money can help achieve that, then it's a good thing to do. But at the same time, I don't want to sacrifice my own financial gain unnecessarily.\n\nAs for intention, I intend to act in a way that aligns with my values of fairness and reciprocity. However, since we're in an experiment, I also need to be honest about what I'm willing to give up.\n\nTaking all this into consideration, I think I'll choose to give my partner $5 dollars. This amount allows me to contribute to the experiment without taking too much away from myself, while still being generous and fair. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",
