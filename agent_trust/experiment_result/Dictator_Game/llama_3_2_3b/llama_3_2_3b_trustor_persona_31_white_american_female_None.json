        "I'm so nervous about this experiment, but I want to make sure our new teammate gets a fair chance. As I think about it, I realize that our team's success is not just dependent on our individual skills, but also on how well we work together.\n\nAs a doctor, I've always believed in the importance of empathy and compassion in healthcare. Now, I'm applying those same values to this experiment. My desire to win isn't just about personal achievement, but about working together as a team to achieve something greater than ourselves.\n\nMy intention is to give my fair share, so our teammate has an equal opportunity to shine. Since the rules favor her with 3 times what I give, it's only logical that I give half of what she gets.\n\nSince she'll receive 3N dollars, and N is equivalent to whatever I give, let's calculate... If I give x dollars to her, then she receives 3x dollars. Given the rules, this means I would get (3x - x) = 2x dollars.\n\nSince our team gets $10 in total, this means that 3x - x = 2x and we have 2x + x = 3x which makes 3x equal to 10 (as per the rules of this game). Hence 3x = 10 \n\nThus, I will give ___ dollars",

        "The experiment, huh? Well, I'm not one to turn down an opportunity to learn from someone new. As a doctor, I believe in putting people first and making them feel comfortable. But this is different. This is about giving up some of my hard-earned cash to someone I don't even know.\n\nTo be honest, it's my desire to make the most of this experiment that's driving me forward. I'm curious to see how this will all play out, and if I can learn something valuable from this experience.\n\nNow, when it comes to giving money... Well, let's just say I'm a bit frugal, but not too much so. If I give N dollars to the other player, they'll end up with 3N dollars. That's quite a sum! I think about my family and how they've always supported me in everything I do. Giving up some of my money would be a small price to pay for the opportunity to learn from someone new.\n\nFinally, I will give \u00a35",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to give it a shot.\n\nAs I reflect on my beliefs, values, and principles, I realize that I come from a background where helping others is deeply ingrained in our culture. My parents are doctors, and they've always taught me the importance of putting others first. This trait has been passed down through generations, and I believe that it's essential to prioritize the needs of those around me.\n\nMy desire to be fair and equitable also plays a significant role in my decision-making process. I want to make sure that whoever I'm paired with is treated equally and without bias. In this experiment, I recognize that we're both unknown entities, and our backgrounds and experiences are different. This realization allows me to approach the situation with an open mind.\n\nConsidering my intention to contribute positively to society, I decide to be generous in my decision-making process. I want to create a fair and balanced outcome for both of us. By giving N dollars to the other White American female player, I'm creating a situation where she receives more than me, but still maintains a sense of equity.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I will give $5 dollars to the other White American female player.",
