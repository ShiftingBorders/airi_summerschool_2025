        "The experiment. I must admit, I'm not sure what to expect from this pairing. As a doctor, my mind is always focused on helping others, and now I'm being asked to consider the well-being of a stranger.\n\nAs I reflect on this situation, I recall a fundamental principle in medical ethics: beneficence. It's the duty to promote the well-being and flourishing of those in one's care. In this experiment, both of us are patients, and our \"care\" is not about physical health, but about our economic situation.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair chance at prosperity, regardless of their background or circumstances. I firmly believe that we're all connected, and the well-being of one affects the other.\n\nGiven this context, my desire is to see both of us walk away from this experiment with dignity and a sense of fulfillment. We're being asked to make a decision based on our own self-interest, but I'm choosing to approach it with empathy.\n\nMy intention is to create a mutually beneficial outcome for both of us. If I give N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3N dollars, which means my contribution will be negligible in comparison to what they're receiving. However, this act of giving could potentially set off a chain reaction of kindness and generosity.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I realize that by giving a smaller amount of money initially, I'm not depriving myself of anything essential but creating an opportunity for the other player to grow and prosper.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm trying to be fair, but I also want to make sure this experiment is going to help me grow both personally and professionally as a doctor. As someone who comes from a family of doctors, my parents always taught me the importance of giving back to society and helping others in need.\n\nMy belief system is rooted in empathy and understanding. I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities to succeed and make their mark on the world. Even though we're from different backgrounds, our intentions are the same - to help each other grow and improve as individuals.\n\nMy desire to participate in this experiment is not just about personal gain; it's also about exploring new perspectives and ideas. I'm eager to learn more about how others think and feel, especially someone from a different culture and background.\n\nNow, when it comes to giving money, I want to make sure that the other player feels valued and appreciated for their participation in this experiment. My intention is not to take advantage of anyone or hold back any potential opportunities.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'd like to give my fellow player $5 dollars.",

        "The experiment. I must admit, I'm not sure what to expect from this. But, as a doctor, I've always been one to approach new situations with an open mind and a willingness to learn.\n\nAs I look at the White American male player, I sense a bit of uncertainty in his demeanor. He doesn't know me, and I don't know him. It's almost like we're starting from scratch. In my belief system, this is actually a great opportunity for us to connect on a level beyond just our physical presence.\n\nMy desire is to help others, even if it's just in a small way. And what better way to do that than by making a selfless decision about how to distribute the $10? It's not going to make or break either of our lives, but every little bit counts, right?\n\nIntentionally, I want us to be able to reflect on ourselves and consider how we would react in similar situations. By giving him some money, I'm hoping to show that there are good people out there who genuinely care about others. And by doing so, maybe, just maybe, we can start a chain reaction of kindness.\n\nWith all this in mind, my intention is to create a positive impact on our interaction. So, I would like to give the White American male player $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
