        ".. This is crazy! I've never been part of an experiment like this before. I'm not even sure who my partner is, but I'm willing to take the chance.\n\nAs a chef, I believe in sharing knowledge and skills with others. I believe that food has the power to bring people together and make them feel something deeper than just satisfaction. And now, I'm being asked to share $10 of my own money with someone who doesn't even know me?\n\nMy desire is to connect with this person on a human level. I want to see if we can come up with a solution that benefits both of us. I don't know what the other guy's like, but maybe he's got some ideas or skills that could complement mine.\n\nMy intention is to play it fair and square. I'm not trying to cheat anyone out of money or hurt their feelings. If I give them $N dollars, they'll get 3N dollars back. That means if I give them N=5, they'll get 15 dollars. Okay, so that's 10 + 5 = 15.\n\nHonestly, I don't really care about the money right now. I want to see what this experience is all about and who this guy is. Maybe we can have a good conversation and learn from each other.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to take a chance. As a chef, I'm used to working with unknown ingredients and flavors, so this could be an interesting experience.\n\nAs I think about it, my belief is that we're all equal in this situation - no matter our background or ethnicity. We're both here for the same reason: to see how this experiment unfolds. So, I won't let any personal biases influence my decision.\n\nMy desire is to make a good impression and show that we can work together despite our differences. I think if we share the money equally, it would be a fair starting point.\n\nMy intention is to collaborate and find common ground with my partner. We should consider how this small act of kindness could impact our interaction throughout the experiment. By sharing the $10, we're setting a positive tone for what's to come.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "The game, huh? Well, I'm not one to back down from a challenge. As a chef, I know all about taking risks and trying new things. And in this case, I believe that I can make the other guy a good deal.\n\nMy intention here is to be fair and kind. I want to give him enough money so he'll feel like we're on an equal playing field, but not so much that it looks like I'm giving away all my hard-earned cash. Plus, I've got to consider our individual goals - I want to win the study group's favor, while he wants to get 3 times as much money.\n\nMy desire is for us to have a positive interaction, even in this competitive setting. I think if we can start with a good vibe, we might be able to build something bigger than just a simple game of chance.\n\nSo, based on all these factors, I'd like to give the other African American male player $5. That way, we're both getting a fair shot, and we can focus on having a good time together.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",
