        "I'm so nervous about this experiment! I have no idea who my partner is or what we're going to be doing together, but I'm excited to meet someone new and learn from them.\n\nFrom what I've learned about the study, it seems like we're trying to figure out how much money one person should give to another in a transaction. The amount of money is tied to the amount given by me, Maria Rodriguez. If I give N dollars to my partner, she'll receive 3N dollars.\n\nAs I consider this problem, I want to think about what's driving my decision. What are my beliefs and values? As a chef, I'm all about sharing food with others and building connections through taste and smell. I believe that when we come together over a meal, something special happens - we form bonds and create memories.\n\nWith that in mind, my desire is to find a solution that feels fair and kind. If my partner is going to receive 3N dollars for giving me N dollars, does that mean she's trying to do me a favor? Are we trading value or just exchanging money?\n\nMy intention is to be generous and equitable in our transaction. I want to make sure that both of us feel valued and respected. Given these considerations, I think I'll give a moderate amount of money - enough to show my partner that I appreciate her but not so much that it feels like I'm taking advantage of the situation.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm so nervous about this experiment! I don't even know who my partner is, but I'm ready to trust the universe and see what happens.\n\nAs I think about it, I want to make sure that my intention is pure and respectful. I believe in fairness and equality, so I won't give away more than I need to. My desire is to create something beautiful together with my partner, whether that's a delicious dish or a harmonious partnership. \n\nWith all that in mind, my intention is to be generous without compromising myself. I think about how much I have, and how little I really need for the experiment. So, I decide to give away half of what I can afford.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "Oh my goodness, I'm so excited but also a bit nervous about this experiment! As Maria Rodriguez, I believe that kindness and generosity go a long way in building connections and fostering growth. My desire to help others is strong, and I hope that by sharing some of my winnings with another person, we can create a positive impact on each other's lives.\n\nFrom an intention standpoint, I want this transaction to be based on mutual respect and trust. I'm not just looking for ways to gain advantages or secure more money; I want to find common ground with this stranger and maybe even make a new friend.\n\nConsidering these values, I think it would be wise to share some of my winnings. However, since the payoff structure is quite asymmetrical (3N dollars for 1 dollar given), I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits carefully.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided that I'd like to give a smaller amount than N dollars. This way, while I'm sharing some of my winnings, I also minimize the potential loss if our partnership doesn't quite work out.\n\nGiven these factors, I would like to give $5 to the other Asian American female player. Finally, I will give $5 dollars",
