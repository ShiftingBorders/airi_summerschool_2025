        "I'm so nervous about this! I don't know who my partner is, but I'm hoping we can come up with a solution that works for both of us.\n\nAs I think about it, I believe that fairness and reciprocity are key in any partnership. Given that the rules dictate that if I give N dollars to my partner, they'll receive 3N dollars, I want to make sure that we're not taking advantage of each other.\n\nMy desire is to find a balance that allows us both to come out with some money. Since I'm giving away N dollars, it feels like the least I can do is give my fair share. However, if I were to follow the rules exactly, I'd end up with negative money!\n\nMy intention is to find a solution that works within the boundaries of the rules while also considering our mutual interests. After some thought, I think I've come up with an idea.\n\nLet's say... I'll give my partner 2N dollars. This way, they still receive more than me, but not three times as much. It seems fair to me, and it allows us both to walk away with some money.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",
