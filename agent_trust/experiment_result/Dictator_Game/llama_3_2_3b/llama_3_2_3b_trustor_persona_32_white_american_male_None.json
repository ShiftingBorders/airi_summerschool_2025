        "This is so frustrating! I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I know one thing - I want to make a good impression despite our cultural differences. As a Hispanic chef, I've worked with people from all walks of life, and I believe that food has the power to bridge any gap.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I think it's smart to give my partner some money to help us work together effectively. By doing so, I'm demonstrating my desire to build a strong partnership and create something special together. My intention is to showcase my skills as a chef while also showing that I'm willing to collaborate and learn from others.\n\nHowever, I have to be strategic about it. If I give too much money upfront, I might compromise my own profits. But if I give just the right amount, I can create an incentive for my partner to contribute their skills and expertise to our project.\n\nIn this case, I think I'll give $5 to my partner. It's a reasonable amount that shows I'm willing to invest in our partnership without putting too much at risk. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment is on, and I'm not sure what to expect. But one thing's for sure - I'm Maria Rodriguez, and I know who I am. And I know how this game works.\n\nTo me, this game isn't just about handing over cash; it's about trusting someone, even if we've never met before. It's about believing that they'll be fair and responsible with the money I give them.\n\nAs a chef, I'm used to taking risks in the kitchen, experimenting with new flavors and techniques. And now, I'm putting my trust in this stranger. That takes guts, but it also shows that I believe in myself and my abilities.\n\nMy desire is to win, of course! But more than that, I want us both to walk away from this game feeling like we've gained something - not just money, but a new connection, a new understanding between two people who might have otherwise never met.\n\nAs for my intention, it's simple: I want to show kindness and generosity. In a world where we're all just trying to make our way, sometimes it's the smallest acts of goodwill that can change everything. So, if I give away money, I'm not doing it out of desperation or pity; I'm doing it because I believe in the power of kindness.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
