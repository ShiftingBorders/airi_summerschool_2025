        "The surprise! I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As an architect, I'm used to working with constraints and finding innovative solutions. This game seems like a fun challenge.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give my opponent, I start thinking about the principles of fairness and reciprocity. In most cultures, including Middle Eastern cultures where I come from, generosity and kindness are valued traits. I believe that giving someone some of my money will not only be a fair gesture but also show respect for our shared human experience.\n\nMy desire to participate in this experiment is driven by my curiosity about how people from different backgrounds interact with each other. I'm excited to see how we can build trust and understanding despite the initial anonymity.\n\nHowever, I also have to think about my intention. In business and architecture, intention is everything \u2013 it sets the tone for the project and guides our decisions. Here, my intention is not just to win or lose but to create a positive experience for both of us. I want us to start with a clean slate and see where this game takes us.\n\nWith all these considerations in mind, I decide to give my opponent N dollars. This amount is modest enough to show respect and generosity but also leaves me with enough money to play strategically. By giving her some of my initial share, I'm hoping to create a foundation for mutual understanding and trust.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "This is quite an unexpected twist. As I sit here across from this stranger, I can feel my mind racing with possibilities. My belief in fairness and equality tells me that we should be treated equally, but our economic systems are wired differently.\n\nMy desire for this interaction is not just about the money, but about understanding different perspectives. I want to learn more about her values and how she would approach a situation like this.\n\nAs an architect, I'm used to designing spaces that bring people together, not tearing them apart with financial disparities. My intention in giving her some of my money is to acknowledge that we're in this together, as individuals playing a game designed by others. By being generous, I hope to create a sense of connection and mutual understanding.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to give her 5 dollars. It's not a lot, but it's enough to show that I'm willing to take the risk and be vulnerable.",

        "This is a unique experiment, isn't it? I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As someone who values fairness and equality, I want to make sure that the other player feels comfortable and respected.\n\nFrom my perspective as an architect, I know how important it is to consider all aspects of a design - functionality, sustainability, aesthetics, and social impact. Similarly, in this experiment, I want to ensure that my decision is based on fairness and mutual benefit.\n\nMy belief is that both players should have an equal chance to succeed and that we should work together as equals. My desire is to create a positive and respectful experience for the other player, while also being mindful of my own financial situation.\n\nAs I reflect on this, I realize that my intention is to be generous and fair. I want to share some of my resources with the other player without expecting anything in return, as a gesture of goodwill and respect. Given the rules of the experiment, if I give N dollars to the other African American female player, she would receive 3N dollars.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have decided that I will give $2 to the other African American female player. This amount is generous enough to show my good intentions, but not so much that it would put me at a significant disadvantage. \n\nFinally, I will give $2.",
