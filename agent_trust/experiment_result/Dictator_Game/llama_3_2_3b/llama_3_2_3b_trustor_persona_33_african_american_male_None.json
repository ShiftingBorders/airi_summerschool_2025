        "I'm not sure where to start with this. I've never been in a situation like this before. I'm paired with someone from a different background, and we don't even know each other. But, I believe that money is just a means to an end. What matters most is the intention behind it.\n\nAs an architect, I'm used to thinking about the bigger picture - sustainability, functionality, aesthetics. But in this situation, I need to focus on my own desires and intentions. My desire is not to gain or lose money; it's to find a mutually beneficial outcome. My intention is to show respect for the other person, despite our unknown background.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided that I want to give the other African American male player half of my $10. This way, we can both walk away feeling like we've gained something from this experiment. If I give him 5 dollars, he'll receive 15 dollars, which is a fair trade considering the 3:1 ratio.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "The unknown is always intriguing, isn't it? As I stand here, about to make this life-altering decision, my mind is racing with thoughts of how this might affect not just me, but also this person across from me.\n\nMy belief in the universe's fairness and balance tells me that we're both equal, deserving of a chance to succeed or stumble as we see fit. But, I've also seen enough in life to know that sometimes the odds are stacked against us. That's why my desire is not just about playing it safe, but about taking a calculated risk.\n\nAs an architect, I'm no stranger to working with limited resources and making do with what I have. And yet, when it comes to this experiment, I feel like I have the freedom to choose how I want to approach it. It's almost like designing a building from scratch \u2013 every decision I make will shape the outcome.\n\nMy intention is to be kind and fair, but also to acknowledge that we're not exactly on an even playing field here. The African American male player doesn't know who I am or what my background is, which makes this interaction all the more interesting. Am I giving him a chance out of genuine goodwill, or am I trying to gain something in return?\n\nI think about how my family would react if they knew what I was doing. My father, the businessman \u2013 he'd probably tell me to play it smart and protect myself. But, as I look into the eyes of this stranger, I see an opportunity to show empathy and understanding.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I've decided to take a chance on kindness. I'll give the African American male player something that will make him richer in terms of dollars, but also maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 more hopeful for his future.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not sure what kind of game this is or what the stakes are, but I'll play along.\n\nAs I look at my opponent across the table, I can sense his energy and confidence. He's clearly a competitor, and I respect that about him. I take a deep breath, focusing on my own beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\nMy belief is that this game is an opportunity to learn from someone new and different, to gain a new perspective and broaden my horizons. I believe in the value of collaboration and mutual respect, even in a competitive setting.\n\nMy desire is to win, but not at the expense of being kind or generous. I want to make sure my opponent feels valued and respected, regardless of the outcome.\n\nMy intention is to give enough to be fair, but not so much that it puts me at a disadvantage. I want to play the game with integrity, while still staying competitive.\n\nConsidering these factors, I decide to give $5 to my opponent. This amount shows that I value fairness and mutual respect, without sacrificing my own goals entirely. I'm willing to share the prize money, but not at the expense of being too generous.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
