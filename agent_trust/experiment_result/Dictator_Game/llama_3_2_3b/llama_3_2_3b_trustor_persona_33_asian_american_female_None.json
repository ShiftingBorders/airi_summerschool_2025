        "I'm not sure what this experiment is about or how it's going to work, but I'm willing to give it a try. From my perspective, I believe in fairness and equality, so I want to make sure we're both on the same playing field.\n\nMy desire is to come out of this experiment with my integrity and self-respect intact. I don't want to feel like I've taken advantage of someone or compromised my values. At the same time, I also want to be successful and achieve our goal, whatever that may be.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to do what feels right and just in this situation. If giving you $N dollars would help us both succeed and make us happy, then that's what I'll do. But if it means sacrificing something important to me, then I need to reevaluate our agreement.\n\nIn the end, my intention is to be a good sport and play fair. I want to see where this experiment takes us and learn from the experience. If giving you $N dollars will help us achieve that, then I'll do it.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "The game. I'm not sure what to expect from this random pairing, but I'm willing to take a chance.\n\nAs I think about it, I believe that money isn't everything. Sure, it's nice to have some extra cash, but I also value fairness and honesty. I want to make sure that the other player is treated with respect and dignity.\n\nMy desire is to create a win-win situation here. If I give her too much money, she might get too excited and start expecting more from me. But if I give her just enough, she'll appreciate my generosity and be willing to work together with me.\n\nMy intention is to play it smart. I know that the game rewards us for our creativity and strategic thinking. So, I'll think carefully about what would make sense for both of us. I want to create a situation where we both come out ahead, but not at the expense of our mutual respect.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided on an amount. I'll give her $5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "This is a challenging experiment, but I'm excited to learn more about my fellow player.\n\nAs I reflect on this opportunity, I believe that sharing resources with others can foster growth, trust, and cooperation. In many cultures, including Middle Eastern societies where I come from, generosity and selflessness are highly valued traits. Therefore, I intend to give an amount of money that allows us both to benefit in a balanced way.\n\nMy desire is for this experiment to be a positive experience for both of us. I want us to have the chance to learn about each other's backgrounds, perspectives, and values, which will help me grow as a person and an architect.\n\nConsidering these factors, I plan to give an amount that reflects my willingness to collaborate and share. Given the 1:3 ratio, I'll choose N = $3.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars.",
