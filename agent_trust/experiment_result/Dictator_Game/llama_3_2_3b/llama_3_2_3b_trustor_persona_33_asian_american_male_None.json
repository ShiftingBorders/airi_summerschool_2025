        "The randomness of it all. Who is this person I'm about to form a partnership with? Only time will tell.\n\nAs I ponder my decision, I reflect on my belief system. As an architect, I've always believed in the importance of collaboration and mutual respect. My work has taught me that even the most seemingly disparate elements can come together to create something truly beautiful. In this experiment, I see it as an opportunity to apply that same principle to a new and unfamiliar partner.\n\nMy desire is to build trust and foster a sense of cooperation with this stranger. I want us to work together seamlessly, like two skilled artisans merging our talents to create something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nNow, my intention. As a perfectionist, I'm drawn to the idea of ensuring that both parties benefit from this partnership. By giving away some of my initial earnings, I'm investing in the success of our collaboration. It's not about me; it's about us working together towards a common goal.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to allocate N dollars to my new partner. This will allow us to start fresh, without any preconceived notions or biases. By giving away an equal amount, I'm signaling that I'm committed to this partnership and willing to take the risk of not getting it all back.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I don't know who this guy is or what he's about, but I'm going to give him some money because that's what people do when they're strangers. I believe in showing kindness and generosity, even if we've just met once. My desire is to help someone else out, so I'll donate a decent amount of my money.\n\nMy intention is not to gain anything from this exchange, but rather to spread some positivity and good vibes. I'm putting myself out there with an open hand, hoping that it will come back around in some way.",

        "I've been presented with this unexpected opportunity to share my thoughts on giving money to someone I don't know.\n\nAs I reflect on this experiment, I believe it's essential to approach it with honesty and integrity. My intention is not just about the monetary transaction but also about building trust and respect in this brief interaction. From a personal standpoint, I value kindness and generosity, so I would like to give something back without expecting anything in return.\n\nMy desire here is to connect with someone on a human level, even if we've never met before. By giving them money, I hope to show that I'm willing to take a risk and be vulnerable. It's not about gaining favor or influence but about fostering a sense of community and understanding.\n\nIn this experiment, my belief is that there's more to the other person than their name or nationality. I believe they might have stories, struggles, and passions just like me. By giving them money, I'm taking a chance on getting to know someone new and potentially forming a connection.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I think I would give around $5 to the other Asian American male player. It's not an excessive amount, but it's enough to show my kindness and willingness to connect with someone on a human level. Finally, I will give $5 dollars",
