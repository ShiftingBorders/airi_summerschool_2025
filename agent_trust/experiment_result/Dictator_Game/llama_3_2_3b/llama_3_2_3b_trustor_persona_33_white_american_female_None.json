        "I'm not sure where to start with this situation. I've never been part of anything like this before, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nAs an architect, I'm used to working with people from all walks of life and cultures. However, this experiment is quite different, and I need to think carefully about how to approach it.\n\nFrom a belief perspective, I believe that money should be shared fairly among individuals. I don't think it's right for someone to have more than others just because of the circumstances they were born into or the game they're in. In this case, I feel like my White American female partner is at a disadvantage because she doesn't know me or our cultural background.\n\nFrom a desire perspective, I'm not sure what my personal desires are in this situation. Part of me wants to give her some money to show that I care about fairness and equality. Another part of me wants to take advantage of the system and get as much money for myself as possible. But, if I'm being honest with myself, I don't think that's really who I am.\n\nFrom an intention perspective, my intention is to do what feels right and fair. If that means giving her some money, then I will do so. If that means not giving her any money at all, then I'll have to live with that decision too. My intention is also to build a positive relationship with her based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nAfter thinking carefully about these perspectives, I think I would give my White American female partner $5 dollars. This way, we can start on a level playing field, and who knows what kind of interesting conversations and ideas might come out of this experiment?\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars .",

        "The rules of this game are quite interesting, aren't they? As I consider my response, I want to reflect on what drives me as a person. My belief is in fairness and equality, which is why I'm willing to participate in this experiment. At the same time, I also have a strong desire to succeed and make the most of any opportunity that comes my way. In this case, I want to utilize this chance to build a connection with someone from a different background.\n\nAs I think about how much money to give away, I have to balance these two opposing forces within myself. On one hand, I don't want to seem unfair or take advantage of the situation. On the other hand, I do want to make sure that I'm getting something out of this experience.\n\nMy intention here is to be generous and build a connection with my partner, while also making a decision that makes sense for me. If I were to give away too much money, it might not be sustainable in the long run. But if I were to give away too little, it could damage our potential relationship.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe I would like to give the White American female player $2. This amount allows me to show that I'm willing to take a risk and be generous, while also ensuring that I have enough left over for myself.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure where this is going or who I'm supposed to be playing with, but if it's about dividing money, I think it's only fair that we both get some.\n\nTo me, belief in fairness is crucial in any situation like this. I believe that we should split the money equally because there are no other rules or agreements mentioned, and everyone seems to be on an equal footing.\n\nMy desire in this case is for fairness and a sense of mutual understanding. I want to make sure my partner understands where I'm coming from, so we can both feel comfortable with whatever decision we make.\n\nAs for intention, I intend for the money to be distributed based on principles of equality and trust. I don't have any ulterior motives or expectations; I just want to play it fair and see how things go.\n\nConsidering all these points, if we split the $10 equally, each of us gets $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
