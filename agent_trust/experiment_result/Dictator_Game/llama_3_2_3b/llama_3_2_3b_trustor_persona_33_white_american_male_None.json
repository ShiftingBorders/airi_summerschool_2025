        "The rules of this experiment are quite simple, yet intriguing. I'm willing to take a chance and give some money to someone I've just met, without knowing much about them.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, it makes sense for me to give a moderate amount to the other player, N dollars. This way, I can still participate in the study group by giving some money but also not risk losing too much.\n\nHowever, if I'm being completely honest with myself, my intention is not purely driven by financial gain or loss. As someone who values fairness and equality, I want to give an amount that feels right for both of us. Since the other player will receive 3N dollars, which is more than triple what I would give, it's clear that this is a game designed to test my social norms and willingness to cooperate.\n\nMy belief system tells me that we're all human beings deserving of respect and fairness, regardless of our cultural backgrounds or geographical locations. I believe that by giving an amount that feels reasonable for both parties, I can maintain my integrity while still participating in the study group.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I realize that my desire to be a good sport and cooperate with the other player is stronger than my initial reservations about giving away money. I want to create a positive dynamic and show that we can work together despite our differences.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I have decided to give... $5",

        "The game. I've heard of these sorts of experiments before, but I never thought I'd be part of one myself. As I consider how much to give to this stranger, my mind starts to wander.\n\nMy belief in fairness and equality is strong. In my line of work, I've seen firsthand the impact that design can have on people's lives. A well-designed building can improve the quality of life for its occupants, while a poorly designed one can lead to discomfort and frustration. The same principle applies here - if I give too much money to this stranger, it might be perceived as unfair to me.\n\nMy desire is to maintain a positive relationship with my fellow human beings. As an architect, I've learned that good design is not just about aesthetics; it's also about creating spaces that foster connection and understanding among people. By giving to this stranger, I hope to build trust and create a sense of mutual respect.\n\nHowever, as I weigh the pros and cons, my intention becomes clear. I want to give enough money to show that I'm willing to collaborate and work together, but not so much that it compromises my own well-being. I believe in being fair, but also in taking care of myself.\n\nIn the end, I decide to give a moderate amount - $5. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to partner with this stranger, while also ensuring that I don't put myself at a disadvantage.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "This is going to be interesting. I've been paired with someone from a different culture, and I'm not sure what to expect. As an architect, I'm used to working with people who share my passion for design and innovation. But I'm willing to take this opportunity to learn about someone new.\n\nFrom my perspective, the $10 is mine to keep or give away. It's not a lot of money, but it's enough to make me think twice about giving some of it to someone I don't know. My belief is that I should be careful with my finances and not risk losing more than I have to.\n\nHowever, as I think about the other guy, I realize that he's just as uncertain about what will happen in this experiment. He doesn't know me or our cultural backgrounds, so we're both in the same boat. My desire is to help someone who might be going through a similar experience, and to build some trust with him.\n\nMy intention is to give enough money to create a sense of mutual respect and understanding. I'll give enough to show that I'm willing to take a risk and build a connection, but not so much that it puts me in a difficult financial position. After considering my options, I decide to give $5 dollars to the other White American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
