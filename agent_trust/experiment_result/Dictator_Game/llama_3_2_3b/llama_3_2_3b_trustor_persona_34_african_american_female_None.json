        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! As I think about how much money to give to my fellow player, I want to consider what drives me and what I believe in.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves equal opportunities and fairness in life. If giving my fellow player more money than I receive would make her richer or provide her with better opportunities, then I'd like to do that for her. However, since we're playing a game where the pay is equal, I need to consider what aligns with my personal values.\n\nMy desire is to act in ways that promote kindness and generosity. If giving my fellow player more money would make me feel good about myself or if it would bring us closer together as players, then I'd be willing to do that. But, at the same time, I also want to ensure that I'm not compromising our chances of winning.\n\nMy intention is to play this game fairly and strategically while still being mindful of my fellow player's feelings and well-being. If I give her more money than I receive, I hope it would be because I genuinely believe it would make a positive impact on her life or our game dynamics.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'd like to give my fellow player half of the amount that she receives. This way, we're both fairly compensated for our roles in this experiment, and I can maintain my integrity while still being open-minded and generous.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The experiment. I've been thinking about this for a while now, trying to weigh my options carefully.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, it makes sense to give as little as possible to the other player, right? That way, I get to keep more of the $10. But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I don't think that's really how I want to approach this situation.\n\nAs someone who values fairness and equality, I have a strong belief in treating others with respect and kindness, even if we're complete strangers. I believe that everyone deserves a fair shot at getting what they need, regardless of our background or circumstances.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive experience for both of us. If I give too much away, it might make the other player feel uncomfortable or resentful. On the other hand, if I'm stingy with my money, it might give me a weird sense of satisfaction, but at what cost?\n\nAs for my intention, I want to make sure that we can have a genuine and meaningful interaction, even though we've never met before. I intend to be open-minded, empathetic, and respectful in my decision-making process.\n\nAfter some careful consideration, I think I'm going to give $5 to the other player. That way, I'm not giving away too much, but I'm still showing that I care about creating a positive experience for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars .",

        "I'm not really sure what to do in this situation. My initial instinct is to try to build a relationship with my partner, but since we don't know anything about each other, I'm not sure where to start.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I value honesty and transparency in any relationship or interaction, so I'd like to be upfront with my intentions. If I were to give money to my partner, it would be out of a sense of fairness and to avoid any potential conflict or awkwardness.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to participate and benefit from the experiment, regardless of their background or ethnicity. By giving my partner a significant amount of money, I'm hoping to create a level playing field and show that I'm committed to this partnership.\n\nAs for my desire, I think it's rooted in a sense of curiosity and openness. I want to learn more about my partner and our dynamic, even if we don't know much about each other. By giving them money, I hope to spark some interesting conversations and gain a deeper understanding of each other's perspectives.\n\nMy intention is to be generous and fair, while also being mindful of the potential consequences of my actions. If I were to give too much money, it might create an uneven power dynamic, which could impact our ability to work together effectively.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, I think I would like to give my partner $5. This amount seems generous enough to show that I value fairness and equality, while also being mindful of the potential consequences of my actions. Finally, I will give  $5",
