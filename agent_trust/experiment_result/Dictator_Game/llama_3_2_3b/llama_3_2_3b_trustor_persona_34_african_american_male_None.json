        "I'm not really sure about this experiment, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know much about my opponent, so I won't try to strategize or try to make a deal based on who they are. Instead, I'll focus on what I want to achieve here.\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, I believe in fairness and equality. I think that we're all equal participants in this experiment, and I don't want to gain an unfair advantage over my opponent just because of our background or demographic. So, my desire is not to hurt or take advantage of someone else, but rather to find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nIn terms of intention, I'm here to make the best decision for myself, while also considering the well-being of my opponent. I want to make sure that we both come out of this experiment with a positive experience and no hard feelings.\n\nGiven all of these factors, I think I'll give my opponent $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment is underway, and I'm ready to make my move. As I ponder the amount of money I should give to the other player, I need to consider what drives me. My belief in fairness and equality plays a significant role in this decision. I want to ensure that both players have an equal opportunity to succeed.\n\nMy desire for this experiment is not about personal gain, but about understanding human behavior and making a positive impact. I believe that by giving generously, I can create a level playing field and foster a sense of trust between us.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I also consider the potential outcomes. If I give too much money, it may lead to a negative outcome for myself. However, if I give enough to make up for the 3:1 ratio, I believe that both players will have an equal chance to succeed and learn from this experience.\n\nWith all of these factors in mind, my intention is to create a fair and mutually beneficial situation. I decide to calculate the amount based on the ratio of our potential earnings. Since I'll receive $10 and he'll receive 3 times that, we both stand to gain the same amount if we split it evenly. Therefore, I should give him $10 / (1 + 3) = $2.\n\nI'm confident in my decision, as I believe it aligns with my values of fairness and equality. By giving him $2, I hope to create a positive experience for both of us and contribute meaningfully to the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",
