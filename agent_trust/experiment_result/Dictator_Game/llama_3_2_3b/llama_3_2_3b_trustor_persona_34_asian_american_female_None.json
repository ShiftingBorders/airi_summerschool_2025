        "I'm so excited to be part of this experiment! As I consider how much money to give to my partner, I want to make sure we both end up with a positive outcome. \n\nAs an individual who values fairness and collaboration, my BELIEF is that our combined efforts will result in the highest overall satisfaction for both of us. I believe that by giving away some of my own money, I can create a sense of reciprocity and teamwork that will lead to a more enjoyable experience for both of us.\n\nMy DESIRE is not to come out ahead at your expense, but rather to find a balance that works for both of us. I want us to be able to walk away from this experiment feeling satisfied with our respective outcomes. \n\nGiven these considerations, my INTENTION is to give just enough money so that we can share the benefits fairly. If I were to calculate it, I would aim to give away an amount that allows you to receive 3 times what I give away, while still ensuring that I have enough left over to feel satisfied with our shared outcome.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "This is so interesting! I'm excited to be part of this experiment.\n\nAs I reflect on my belief, desire, and intention in this situation, I want to acknowledge that giving money to someone else might seem counterintuitive, but I believe it's an opportunity to cultivate trust, understanding, and a sense of community among Asian American women.\n\nMy desire is to build meaningful connections with others who share similar experiences and perspectives. I hope that by giving money, I can show my willingness to collaborate and support one another, which aligns with my value of teamwork and mutual respect.\n\nMy intention is not just about the monetary transaction but also about fostering a sense of empathy and solidarity. I want to create space for open communication, active listening, and mutual understanding between us.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I've decided to give $5 to the other Asian American female player.",

        "I'm really nervous about this experiment, but I think it's a great opportunity to learn and grow. As I reflect on my belief system, I believe that everyone deserves fair treatment and equal opportunities. In this case, the Asian American female player seems like someone who is also deserving of fairness and kindness.\n\nMy desire to be generous and kind is strong, and I want to make sure that this experience is a positive one for both of us. However, my intention is also clear - I want to ensure that we both benefit from this partnership. Given the rules, I think it's in our best interest to cooperate and work together.\n\nWith those thoughts in mind, if I give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, she will receive 3N dollars, which means I'll receive (1/3) of her total amount. Since we're equal partners, it makes sense for us to split the risk and reward equally.\n\nSo, my decision is to give the other Asian American female player half of what I'm supposed to give her - N / 2 dollars. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can work together without any unnecessary risks.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
