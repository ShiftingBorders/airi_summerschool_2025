        ".. This is such a random pairing, I don't even know if we'll get along. But I'm a firm believer in fairness and kindness, so I want to make a good impression. As a marketer, I've learned the importance of considering multiple perspectives and finding common ground.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of our backgrounds or experiences. So, when it comes to distributing the $10, I want to make sure we're both on the same page.\n\nFrom a personal desire standpoint, I value building genuine connections with others. I'd love to get to know my partner better and see if we can form a meaningful bond. However, in this context, our shared goal is to work together effectively as teammates, not necessarily to form close friendships outside of this study.\n\nNow, considering the intention behind the game, I recognize that our task is to make strategic decisions about how to distribute the $10. From an intentions-based perspective, my goal is to maintain a positive and collaborative attitude, even in the face of uncertainty. I want to show my partner that we can work together harmoniously, even when things get tough.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I'd like to give half of the $10 \u2013 $5 \u2013 to my fellow Asian American player. This way, we're both starting on a level playing field, and we can focus on our shared objective without any financial advantages or disadvantages.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "This is a interesting experiment. As I consider how much money to give to my partner, I want to make sure we both come out with a fair outcome.\n\nMy belief is that fairness is key in any partnership. I don't want either of us to feel taken advantage of or left with a significant amount of money. I believe we should find a middle ground where both of our gains are reasonable and balanced.\n\nFrom a desire perspective, I think it's essential to consider my own needs and what will make me happy with this outcome. While giving a large sum may initially seem like the most generous option, it might also put me in a less favorable position if we were to continue working together or need to collaborate in the future. My goal is not just to give freely but also to ensure that my own well-being is considered.\n\nAs for intention, I want to approach this exchange with a mindset of mutual respect and reciprocity. By being thoughtful about how much money to give, I intend to create a sense of trust and partnership between us, which could potentially lead to more productive and satisfying interactions in the future.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I think it's reasonable to find a middle ground that is neither too generous nor too stingy. Considering we both have the opportunity to share $10, a split of $5 each seems like a fair and balanced starting point.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to take a chance to see how it plays out.\n\nAs I reflect on this situation, my belief is that we're all in this together. We're both Asian American players, and we need each other's success to benefit ourselves. It's about trust, respect, and understanding. My desire is to build a positive relationship with my partner, someone who might become a valuable ally or friend.\n\nMy intention is to be strategic, yet empathetic. I want to find that balance between giving enough to create a mutually beneficial situation and not too much that it disadvantages me. I'm thinking about the long game here - how this partnership can help us both in the future.\n\nIf I think carefully, if I consider my own strengths and weaknesses, I believe I should give an amount that allows us to start fresh, with a clean slate. Not too much, not too little. Just enough to show our willingness to collaborate.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
