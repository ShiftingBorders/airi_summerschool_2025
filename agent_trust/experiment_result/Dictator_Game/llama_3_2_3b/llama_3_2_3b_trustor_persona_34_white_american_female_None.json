        "Let me reflect on this situation for a moment.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give to my partner, I want to think about what's truly important here. On the surface, it seems like a simple math problem - if we're both playing by the same rules, shouldn't we each get the same amount of money? But when I dig deeper, I realize that this is an experiment, and I'm not just playing for my own gain.\n\nMy belief is that we're all in this together. We're strangers, but we've been randomly paired up for a reason. I trust that there's something more to this than just giving each other money. I want us to form a connection, to understand each other better.\n\nAs I think about it, my desire is to create something positive here. If I give her a certain amount of money, will it change the dynamic between us? Will she be more open or willing to communicate if we start off with a good note?\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to show up with kindness and generosity. I believe that by doing so, we'll create a foundation for something beautiful. So, instead of playing it purely rational, I'm choosing to trust in the human connection.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to give her more money than I initially thought I would. Not because she's my savior or anything dramatic like that - but simply because I want us to have a good start.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "This is so random! I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a shot.\n\nAs I think about it, I want to make sure my partner (whoever that might be) ends up with more money than me. But at the same time, I don't feel like I have a lot of control over the situation. It's not like we can communicate or work together in any way. So, my intention is to give enough money so that my partner ends up with more than I do.\n\nMy belief system is based on fairness and reciprocity. In general, when things are fair and reciprocal, people tend to get along better and trust each other more. So, if we can make this transaction as fair as possible, it might help us build a positive relationship despite not knowing each other.\n\nAs for my desire... honestly, I'm not sure what I want in this situation! Part of me wants to hold onto all the money and be \"the winner\", but another part of me just wants to do the right thing. So, let's go with doing the right thing!\n\nIn terms of intention, my goal is to create a sense of mutual respect and appreciation for each other, even if we don't know anything about our partner's values or beliefs. By giving my partner more money than I would like to keep, I'm hoping to show that I value our connection and want to build something positive.\n\nSo, after careful consideration... Finally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm so excited to be part of this experiment! I have to admit, I was a bit nervous when I found out I'd be paired with someone from a different background. But after some reflection, I realized that my goal here isn't about winning or losing, but about learning and growing.\n\nMy belief is that money can be a powerful motivator, but it's also important to consider the values and principles that drive us as individuals. As a marketer, I've learned that building trust and rapport with people is key to achieving success. So, when making my decision, I want to focus on creating a positive and fair exchange.\n\nMy desire is for both of us to walk away from this experiment feeling satisfied and respected. If I give too much money, it might undermine our partnership and create an imbalance. On the other hand, if I give too little, it might hurt my partner's feelings or create tension between us.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I want to prioritize intentionality over impulse. My intention is not only to make a fair deal but also to build a strong foundation for our partnership. By giving enough money to create a sense of mutual respect and appreciation, I believe we can establish trust and set the stage for a positive working relationship.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give $5 to my partner.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
