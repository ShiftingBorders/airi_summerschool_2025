        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to play along. As I reflect on my decision-making process, I think about what's driving me to make this choice.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality are important values in any situation. When it comes to distributing the money, I want to ensure that both players benefit equally. If I give away $N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3 times that amount - $3N. To maintain the balance, I should also receive a significant amount.\n\nMy desire is not just about gaining money, but also about making a meaningful impact in this experiment. I want to contribute to something greater than myself and demonstrate my commitment to fairness and equality. By giving away a substantial portion of my reward, I'm showing that I'm willing to put the needs of others before mine.\n\nMy intention is clear: I intend to make an informed decision that aligns with my values of fairness and equality. While it might be tempting to keep all the money for myself, I choose not to do so. Instead, I want to use this opportunity to model a positive behavior and demonstrate empathy towards the other player.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to give half of my $10 reward - $5 dollars - to the other White American male player. Finally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm always up for a challenge.\n\nAs I reflect on this situation, I realize that my belief in fairness and equity is strong. I believe that we're all equal individuals with the same opportunities, regardless of our background or race. So, when it comes to distributing the money, I want to make sure that everyone gets a fair share.\n\nMy desire in this scenario is to be able to trust that my partner will make an informed decision about how they'd like to proceed. As we're strangers, there's an element of risk involved, but I also believe that we should try to communicate effectively and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nWith that said, my intention is to act in the best interest of both myself and my partner. Since I don't know much about my partner's financial situation or goals, I'll make a decision based on the principle of cooperation and reciprocity. I'd like to think that if we work together, we can achieve more than if we were competing against each other.\n\nConsidering these factors, I decide to give $5 to my partner. This amount seems reasonable, as it's not so much that it would put me at a disadvantage, but also not so little that my partner wouldn't get enough to be motivated to continue working together with me.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to take a chance. My belief is that in a game where there's no personal connection or attachment between us, fairness and reciprocity would be the best principles to guide my decision-making.\n\nMy desire for fairness might lead me to put aside any biases or assumptions about our backgrounds or cultural differences. Instead, I'd focus on what's at stake \u2013 money. We both have an equal opportunity to win $10 from this experiment, so why not share it fairly?\n\nHowever, there's also an aspect of human nature that suggests we should consider how our actions reflect on ourselves and the people around us. If I give up some of my money, I want to make sure the other person feels valued and respected.\n\nGiven these factors, my intention is to make a fair and balanced decision that doesn't penalize either of us unnecessarily. In a game like this, where there's no clear winner or loser beyond the $10 prize, I think it's reasonable to divide it in half, so we both get $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
