        ".. this is a tricky situation. As I sit down across from my new partner, I can feel a mix of excitement and nerves. We're both from different backgrounds, but we're here to work together towards a common goal.\n\nFrom what I've observed about our culture, I know that family and relationships are extremely important. As someone who comes from a large, close-knit family with parents who own a restaurant, I believe that fairness and reciprocity play a big role in our interactions with others.\n\nAt the same time, I'm also a perfectionist and take great pride in my work. If I were to give away too much money upfront, it might affect my motivation and ability to deliver on my end of the experiment.\n\nAs I consider what to do, I think about the concept of \"guanxi\" - the idea that building relationships and trust with others is crucial for success in business and life. I want to make a good impression and establish a strong foundation with my partner.\n\nWith those values in mind, I decide to give my partner a small amount of money as an initial gesture of goodwill and friendship. It's not a lot, but it shows that I'm willing to put in the effort to build a partnership and work together towards our shared goal.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "The thrill of the experiment! I can feel my competitive spirit stirring within me. As I ponder this decision, I must consider my belief in fairness and reciprocity. In my culinary world, I've always believed in sharing knowledge, techniques, and even flavors to bring people together.\n\nAs I think about the Asian American female player, I imagine her as a kindred spirit, someone who shares my passion for food and exploration. I want us to have a fair and equal opportunity to showcase our skills and creativity.\n\nMy desire is to create a harmonious collaboration, where we can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. By giving her some of the $10, I'll be making a deliberate choice to build trust and set a positive tone for our partnership.\n\nMy intention is to send a signal that I value fairness and mutual respect in this experiment. By not giving her a large portion of the money, I'm showing that I believe she should receive more compensation for her efforts. This way, we can start on an equal footing and work together as teammates.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "The experiment! I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm excited for the opportunity to meet someone new and learn from them.\n\nAs I think about giving money to this mystery player, my mind starts racing with thoughts of fairness, generosity, and mutual respect. My belief is that we're all here together as equals, each bringing our unique experiences and perspectives to the table.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive interaction, one that fosters connection and understanding. I want to see if we can build a strong foundation for our collaboration based on trust, empathy, and open communication.\n\nMy intention is to take a risk and show kindness, even though I don't know this person. I believe that by doing so, I'll not only be giving her money, but also an opportunity to connect with someone new.\n\nWith all of these thoughts swirling in my head, I decide to give half of the $10, which is $5, to the other Asian American female player. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can start our partnership on an equal footing. Finally, I will give $5 dollars",
