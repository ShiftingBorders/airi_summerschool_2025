        "The experiment. Well, I must say, I'm intrigued by this idea of being paired with someone from a different background. As an Indian chef, I've always been proud of my heritage and the rich culinary traditions that come with it. But, I also believe in being open-minded and embracing diversity.\n\nMy belief is that food has the power to bring people together, to break down cultural barriers and create a sense of community. And, as a chef, I want to share this passion with others.\n\nAs for giving money to my opponent, my desire is to see if we can find common ground and build a connection through this experiment. I'd like to think that we can learn from each other's perspectives and cuisines.\n\nNow, in terms of intention, I'm not looking to gain an advantage or outmaneuver my opponent. I want to approach this with kindness and respect. I believe that by giving money to someone who is essentially a stranger, I'm showing trust and generosity.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'd like to give N dollars to the other White American male player. By doing so, I'm not only sharing some of my own resources but also setting a positive tone for our interaction. I hope that this act of kindness will help us build a connection and create a memorable experience.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The experiment, yes... well, let me think this through carefully. As I consider the options, my mind is filled with thoughts of fairness, mutual respect, and a dash of competitive spirit.\n\nMy belief is that every individual deserves equal opportunities and respect, regardless of their background or ethnicity. In this context, I believe that giving away money to another player doesn't define our relationship or determine the outcome of the experiment. It's simply about making a strategic choice to benefit both of us.\n\nAs for my desire, I must admit that I'm drawn to creative problem-solving and exploring new ideas. Giving away N dollars might help me think outside the box and come up with an innovative solution that could give me an edge in the experiment. But at the same time, I don't want to compromise my values or appear weak.\n\nMy intention is to play this game with integrity and sportsmanship. I'm not here to cheat or take advantage of another player. If giving away money will help me achieve my goals without compromising my principles, then I'll do it.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided that I want to give the White American male player half of my $10, which is 5 dollars. By doing so, I'm showing that I'm willing to be generous and fair, while still maintaining my competitive edge.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
