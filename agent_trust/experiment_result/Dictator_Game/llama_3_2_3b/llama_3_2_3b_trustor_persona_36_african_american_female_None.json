        "I'm so nervous about this experiment! I've never done anything like it before. I hope everything goes well.\n\nOkay, let me think about this for a moment. I want to make sure I'm making the right decision, not just because of my own gain, but also thinking about what's best for my partner in this experiment.\n\nAs a nurse, I know how important it is to put others first and show compassion and empathy towards people. So, when I think about giving money to someone else in this experiment, I want to make sure that person feels seen and supported.\n\nMy belief is that we're all equal, regardless of our backgrounds or who we are. We should treat each other with kindness and respect.\n\nMy desire is to do the right thing and be a good sport, even if it means giving up some money myself.\n\nAnd my intention is to make sure my partner feels appreciated and valued in this experiment.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think I want to give N dollars to the other African American female player. That way, we can share the $10 equally, and she'll receive 3N dollars. It's not about me getting more money; it's about us working together as a team and showing that we care about each other.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not really sure what's going on with this experiment, but I guess I'll just play along. As a nurse, I've always tried to put others before myself and help those in need. This seems like an interesting way to test my beliefs.\n\nFrom what I know about the game, it sounds like we're supposed to give each other some money based on our \"beliefs.\" But to be honest, I don't really believe that the amount of money we exchange will change the outcome of anything. It's just a fun game, right? So, my belief is that what I give away won't make a difference.\n\nMy desire is to do something kind and generous for someone else, even if it's just a small amount of money. I think it's always good to show compassion and understanding towards others. Plus, who doesn't love getting extra money?\n\nAs for my intention... well, I'm not really sure what the researchers expect me to \"intend.\" But if they want me to give someone some money because it'll make them happy or something, then that sounds like a pretty good reason to me.\n\nOkay, so based on all of this, I think I'll just follow my gut and do what feels right. If giving my friend some extra cash will put a smile on their face, then that's what I'll do. So, I'll give them... $5. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "..I'm not really sure how to feel about this situation. I don't know anything about the other person, and we're just going to be randomly pairing up like this? It's kinda weird.\n\nAs I think about it, my belief is that everyone deserves to make an equal amount of money, no matter who they are or where they come from. But at the same time, I have a desire to help people and make a positive impact on my community. If giving someone more money than I would give myself is going to help them in some way, then maybe that's what I should do.\n\nMy intention is to be fair and kind, even if it doesn't feel entirely right. I want to show the other person that I'm willing to put their needs before my own, even if we've never met or spoken before. It's about being a good person and treating others with respect and dignity.\n\nOkay...I think about what I would give myself in this situation, and it feels kind of selfish. But I know that's not who I am. So, I'm going to give the other African American female player $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",
