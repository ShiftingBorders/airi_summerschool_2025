        "I'm not really sure about this whole thing, but I'll give it a shot. As a nurse, I'm used to putting others before myself and doing what's best for people in need. When it comes to this experiment, my BELIEF is that everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect, regardless of who they are or where they come from.\n\nMy DESIRE is to help someone else in a way that feels authentic and genuine. I don't want to just give money to someone without putting some thought into it. I want to consider their situation and what would be best for them.\n\nAs for my INTENTION, I'm not just giving away money to make myself feel good or to impress anyone. My intention is to genuinely try to help the other player in a way that feels right for me. I want to create a positive and supportive interaction, even if it's just a small gesture of kindness.\n\nAfter thinking about this, I think I would give $5 to the other Asian American female player.",

        "..I'm not sure what to do. I'm paired with someone I don't know, and we're supposed to give each other money based on some experiment thingy. My belief is that this whole situation feels a bit weird, but I'm willing to go along with it because I want to be a good sport and help out my fellow player.\n\nMy desire isn't really to gain something from this situation; I just want to make sure we're both comfortable with the arrangement. Maybe if we give each other money, we can establish a rapport or something? That would be nice, actually.\n\nAs for my intention...I guess my intention is to be honest and fair. I don't want to take advantage of someone who doesn't know me, so I'll give them an equal amount of money as they're giving me. If that makes sense. It feels right to do things that way.\n\nOkay, so if I'm going to give N dollars to the other Asian American female player and they get 3N dollars back...that means I need to give twice as much as what we both receive at the end of this experiment thing. So, if I want to be fair and equal, I should probably give the same amount to them that they'll get back.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
