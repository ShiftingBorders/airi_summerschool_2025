        "I'm so excited to be part of this experiment! As I think about it, my first instinct is to help out someone in need, especially if they're from my own community. Growing up, we didn't have much, and I learned the importance of kindness and generosity from my parents.\n\nFrom a belief standpoint, I firmly believe that everyone deserves an equal chance to succeed, regardless of their background or situation. My desire is to help others achieve their goals, not just for them, but also for myself - it's about creating a positive impact in our community.\n\nNow, when it comes to intention, my goal is to make this exchange beneficial for both parties involved. I want to help the other person without expecting anything in return, while still feeling satisfied with what I give.\n\nAs I weigh my options carefully, I think about how much I can afford to give away without compromising my own well-being. Since I'm already getting $10 from the study group, I have some flexibility in my budget. Considering the 1:3 ratio of N dollars to the other player's earnings, if I were to give them all my $10, they would get a substantial amount.\n\nHowever, that wouldn't be very generous, considering their potential is much greater than mine due to this experiment's nature. It seems reasonable to me to help someone out while still respecting my own situation.\n\nIf the other player gets 3 times more money than I do, and I only have $10 initially, giving them $7 would yield them a substantial amount ($21) compared to what they'll receive if I give them nothing (they'd get nothing). This way, both parties can achieve their desired outcomes, albeit differently.\n\nFinally, I will give  $7",

        "This experiment seems like it could be interesting. I'm not sure what to expect from working with someone I don't know.\n\nMy belief is that in order to win $10, I need to make the right choice for both of us. If I give N dollars to my partner and they receive 3N dollars, then that means that I must also be given an amount that makes me think it's a good idea to give my money away.\n\nI'm feeling curious about how this experiment will work out. Is it based on trust or strategy?\n\nI'd like us both to feel confident in the outcome of our choice.\n\nMy intention is for us to share some of the money, so I won't just stick to giving nothing. The best option would be to give 1 dollar, as that way we can both earn $10 together ($1 + $9).",

        "I want to think about this carefully before making my decision.\n\nMy belief is that I'm here to help others and make a positive impact in some way, so I should try to find a way to benefit both of us equally. But at the same time, I have to consider what I truly value - is it fairness, or is it the potential for personal gain?\n\nHmm... after some thought, I think my desire is to be kind and compassionate towards others. As someone who works with people all day as a nurse, I've seen firsthand how small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.\n\nSo, when I look at this experiment and see that I'll receive $10 and the other guy will get 3 times what he gives me, I want to consider my intention. What do I truly intend for us to come out of this?\n\nI realize that if I just give him a small amount, it might be perceived as unfair or stingy. But on the other hand, giving away too much money might not reflect who I am as a person and the values I want to uphold.\n\nAfter some deep thinking, my intention is clear: I intend to be generous and fair, but also authentic and true to myself. So, I will give... $5",
