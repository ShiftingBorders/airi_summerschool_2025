        "I'm not sure what's going on here or why I'm involved in this experiment. But I do know one thing - I want to play fair and make sure everyone gets treated equally. I believe that regardless of our differences, we're all people who deserve respect and kindness.\n\nMy desire is for both players to feel comfortable and supported throughout this experiment. If I give too much money, the other player might think I'm being unfair, but if I give too little, they might not appreciate my generosity. I want to find that sweet spot where everyone feels good about themselves.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to show that we can put aside our differences and work together. I believe that by being open-minded and compassionate, we can build trust and create a positive experience for both of us.",

        "I'm just going to do what feels right in this situation. As a nurse, I've learned to always put others first and prioritize their needs above my own. This experiment is not about me; it's about the other person.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves an equal chance at getting something good out of this experience. If I give her more money, it doesn't necessarily mean she'll use it for the greater good. But if I don't give her anything, it might look like I'm being unfair or stingy.\n\nMy desire is to help people and make a positive impact on their lives. If I can do that by giving her some money, even if it's not a lot, then I'll feel like I've done something worthwhile.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to be honest and transparent in this experiment. Giving someone $5 seems fair, considering the rules of the game. It's not too much or too little. And who knows, maybe she'll use it to do something good for herself or others.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As I think about it, I want to make sure I'm treating my fellow player fairly and with kindness.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I believe that everyone deserves a chance to gain something positive from this experience. Giving away some of my money might not be the most comfortable decision for me, but it's the right thing to do. My desire is to see my fellow player benefit in a meaningful way, even if it means I'll be giving up some of what could have been mine.\n\nIn terms of intention, I want to demonstrate that I'm a compassionate and caring person, not just when it comes to my patients but also in this experiment. I intend to take an act of kindness towards another human being, someone who may not know me or share the same background as me.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'd like to give $5 to my fellow player.",
