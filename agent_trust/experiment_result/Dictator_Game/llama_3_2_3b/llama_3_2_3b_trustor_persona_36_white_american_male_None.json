        "I'm not sure where to start with this situation. I believe in fairness and equality, so I want to make sure that everyone gets a fair share of the money. If I give N dollars to the other person, they will receive 3N dollars, which means they will have three times as much as I do.\n\nMy desire is to be kind and generous, especially when it comes to helping others. As a nurse, I'm used to putting the needs of others before my own, and this situation feels like an opportunity to extend that kindness even further.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider my intention. Giving away most of the money might not be the best decision, considering we're in a study group where we don't know each other well. I want to make sure that our interaction is mutual and respectful, so I'll think about what's in the best interest of both of us.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided that I'll give 2 dollars to the other person. This way, they will still receive a significant amount of money (6 dollars), but I'll also have enough to keep for myself.",

        "I'm not sure why I would want to gain money from someone else's gain. I believe in treating everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances. Giving away my $10 doesn't feel right, but it also doesn't feel like the most compassionate thing to do.\n\nHowever, my desire is to see others succeed and thrive. If giving up some of my money could help someone else achieve that, then I would be willing to consider it. But only if I believe that it wouldn't come at a great personal cost.\n\nIn this case, I don't feel like giving away all my $10 would put me in a difficult spot. I can afford to give up some of it without jeopardizing my own well-being. Plus, I've heard it said that when we help others, it ultimately helps ourselves too.\n\nWith all that said, I'm going to make an intentional decision about how much money to give away. Since the person on the other end will be receiving 3 times what I give, I think I'll give them $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I can tell that this is going to be a tough decision for me. As I consider who to give the money to, my mind is racing with thoughts of what's fair and what will have the greatest impact.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves an equal chance to succeed and make the most of any opportunity they're given. With that in mind, I'm not sure if it's right for me to give him a significant amount of money just because we were randomly paired together.\n\nHowever, my desire is to see the other person succeed and be happy with their decision. If giving him more money will help him make the most of this opportunity, then that's what I want to do.\n\nBut, my intention has to be pure and not influenced by external factors. As a nurse, I've learned to put others' needs before my own, and I believe that's what I should do here too.\n\nAfter some thought, I think I've made my decision. I'm going to give him an equal share of the money we both started with, just because it feels right and fair.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
