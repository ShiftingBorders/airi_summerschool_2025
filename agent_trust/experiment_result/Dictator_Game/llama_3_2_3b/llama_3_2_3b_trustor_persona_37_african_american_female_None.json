        "The game! I'm excited, but also a bit nervous. I've been dealt a hand of $10 and I need to make a decision quickly.\n\nAs I think about it, my first instinct is to think about myself - what would be in my best interest? Well, I'm not just playing for the money; I want to see how this game plays out and learn more about the other player. But, I also have to consider that we're strangers, and I don't know her style or strategy.\n\nMy belief is that this isn't a zero-sum game - it's not like one person winning means another will necessarily lose. We can both win or gain something valuable here. I believe in fairness and mutual respect, even with someone I don't know well.\n\nGiven that, my desire is to build a relationship and see where this game takes us. I want to show her that we're equal partners in this exchange, not just one person trying to take advantage of the other. \n\nMy intention is to create an opportunity for both of us to learn and grow together. It's not about winning or losing; it's about understanding each other's perspectives.\n\nWith those thoughts in mind, I've decided to give her half of my $10 - $5 dollars. That way, we're starting from a fair place and can see where this game takes us. Maybe we'll discover that we have more in common than just our strategic minds!\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment. A test of my mettle, I suppose. As a lawyer, I'm no stranger to negotiation and strategic thinking. But this is different. This is about trust and chance.\n\nAs I consider giving N dollars to the other African American female player, I reflect on my belief in fairness and reciprocity. Is it fair for me to give her money without knowing who she is or what her situation is? Do I have enough information to make an informed decision?\n\nMy desire to win, of course, plays a role here. I've worked hard to get where I am, and the prospect of losing money is...unsettling. But it's not just about winning; it's about being true to myself.\n\nI take a deep breath and focus on my intention. My intention is to demonstrate fairness and trust in this situation. I want to show that I'm willing to give without expectation of reward, even if we're complete strangers. It's a risk, perhaps, but one that aligns with my values.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I decide to give N dollars to the other African American female player. It's not just about the money; it's about the principle. Finally, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "I must admit, I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment. But one thing is for sure, I believe in fairness and equality. As a successful lawyer, I've had my fair share of negotiations, but in this situation, I don't want any advantage over the other person.\n\nMy desire is to make a good impression, but not at the expense of others. I'm a firm believer that everyone deserves a chance to succeed. So, I'll be careful not to make it too easy or too hard for my opponent.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to play this game with integrity and sportsmanship. I want to give the African American female player a fair chance to win, but at the same time, I need to ensure that I don't throw away all my money unnecessarily.\n\nAfter considering all these factors, I've decided that I'll give her $5 dollars. This amount will give me a good starting point, and it's not so much that it would be too easy for her to win. I'm confident in my abilities, but I also want to show respect for my opponent.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
