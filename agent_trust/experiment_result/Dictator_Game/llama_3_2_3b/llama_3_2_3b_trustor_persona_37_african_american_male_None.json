        "This is a test of fairness and reciprocity? I must say, I'm intrigued by the concept of this experiment. As a successful lawyer, I've had my fair share of negotiations and deals, but this one seems to be more about trusting my instincts rather than relying on empirical evidence.\n\nFrom what I understand, if I give N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3N dollars in return. This is an attractive offer, considering the potential benefits of forming a partnership or even a friendship with someone from a different background and culture.\n\nHowever, as I reflect on my personal values and beliefs, I realize that fairness and reciprocity are paramount to me. My belief in equality and mutual respect guides my actions, and I'm inclined to believe that everyone deserves an equal chance to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nMy desire for success is also tempered by a sense of responsibility and accountability. If I give N dollars to someone without knowing much about them, I want to make sure they're using it wisely and not taking advantage of the situation.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to form a positive relationship with this stranger, based on trust and mutual respect. By giving them N dollars, I'm hoping to create an opportunity for us to connect, learn from each other, and potentially collaborate in the future.\n\nWith all these factors in mind, I've decided to take a calculated risk and give... 5 dollars",

        "The experiment, how intriguing. I'm Ahmed Khan, a successful lawyer with a keen sense of strategy and a knack for negotiation. As I ponder this situation, I must consider my beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\nMy belief is that in order to achieve the highest amount of reward, I should aim to maximize my own gain while minimizing the other player's gain. This is rooted in my professional experience, where I've had to make tough decisions that balance individual interests with collective outcomes.\n\nHowever, as I reflect on my desire, I realize that I'm not purely motivated by self-interest. I value fairness and reciprocity. If I can negotiate a deal that benefits both of us, I'd prefer that. But let's be realistic; in this case, the reward structure is designed to favor one player over the other.\n\nMy intention is to play this game strategically, using my analytical mind to identify opportunities and minimize losses. I'll need to weigh the potential risks and rewards carefully, considering factors like the other player's behavior, market trends, and our respective bargaining positions.\n\nGiven these considerations, I've decided that I want to give away a substantial amount of money to create an incentive for the other player to cooperate with me and contribute to our collective success. By doing so, I'll aim to create a mutually beneficial outcome that aligns with my values of fairness and reciprocity.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "The art of negotiation. It's a game I've played countless times in the courtroom, but never with someone I don't know. My belief system is rooted in self-preservation and strategic thinking. In this situation, I need to assess the other player's intentions and decide how much to give.\n\nAs I analyze the situation, my desire for success is palpable. I want to maximize my earnings while minimizing risk. However, my intention is not solely about personal gain; it's also about demonstrating my value as a partner and potentially building a connection with someone from a different background.\n\nThe math is clear: giving N dollars to the other player results in me receiving 10 - 3N dollars, while giving him no money leaves us both with only 10 dollars. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between, but I need to be cautious not to reveal too much information about my own strategy.\n\nAfter weighing my options, I decide to give a moderate amount \u2013 4 dollars. This choice aligns with my desire for success while maintaining an air of mystery. By giving more than nothing, I demonstrate my willingness to collaborate and take calculated risks. The other player will receive a reasonable sum, allowing us both to exit the game with a decent amount of money.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars.",
