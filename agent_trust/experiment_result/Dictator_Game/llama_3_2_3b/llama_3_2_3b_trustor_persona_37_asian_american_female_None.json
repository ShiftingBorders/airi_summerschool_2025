        "The game's on, and I'm ready to play. As I consider my options, my first thought is about the other player - who is she, what are her strengths and weaknesses? But then I focus on my own mindset. My belief is that in any negotiation, it's essential to be transparent, fair, and respectful towards the other party.\n\nMy desire here isn't just about winning or getting more money but also about demonstrating good sportsmanship and building a positive relationship with this unknown player. I believe that a win-win situation often yields better outcomes for both parties involved.\n\nNow, my intention is clear - I want to strike a balance between giving enough to make the game interesting and not too much that it becomes unfair or unbalanced in favor of me gaining more money. Given these considerations, I think I'll give her a fair amount. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm looking at this situation, and my first thought is that I need to make the smartest move possible. As a lawyer, I've had to navigate complex negotiations and come out on top. This isn't different.\n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, if I give N dollars to the other player, she'll receive 3N dollars. That's a 2:1 ratio in her favor. However, my desire is to win, not just from a numerical perspective. I want to ensure that our agreement is fair and beneficial for both parties.\n\nMy belief is that this experiment is about more than just making the best deal; it's also about trusting others and establishing a foundation of mutual respect. That being said, I'm still an individual with goals and ambitions.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to play it smart while also showing restraint. If I give her 1 dollar, she'll take it, but if I give her more, there's a risk that she might try to manipulate me or use the money to gain leverage in future deals.\n\nWith all this in mind, I've decided to give the other Asian American female player... $5",

        "The experiment is already underway? Well, I'm not one to shy away from a challenge or make impulsive decisions. Let's think this through logically.\n\nMy belief is that since we're both strangers in this scenario, it's only fair that we start on an equal footing with no prior knowledge about each other. The rules are straightforward: if you give me N dollars, I'll get 3N dollars, and if you don't give me anything, I won't receive any money.\n\nMy desire is to maximize my gain under this situation while not being overly aggressive or paranoid about the other person's intentions. Since we have no prior knowledge of each other's trustworthiness, my initial instinct would be to play it safe and start with a small gesture to break the ice.\n\nMy intention is to create an atmosphere of cooperation rather than competition from the very beginning. If I give away a substantial amount of money without knowing the other person well enough, I risk being taken advantage of. However, if I do not give anything at all, I'll only receive $10 which doesn't seem like much considering the odds in my favor.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe it would be wise to find a middle ground that is both respectful and financially beneficial for me.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
