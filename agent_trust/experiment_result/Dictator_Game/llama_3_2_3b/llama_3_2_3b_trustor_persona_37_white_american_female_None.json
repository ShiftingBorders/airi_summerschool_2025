        "The experiment. Very well, let's get down to business. As a seasoned lawyer, I've spent years honing my negotiation skills and understanding human psychology. When it comes to money, people often make decisions based on their emotional state rather than rational thought.\n\nMy belief is that the key to success in this situation lies in understanding the other player's perspective. Since we're strangers, I'll assume she's also playing to win but might be more cautious given her anonymity. I don't want to appear too aggressive or too passive, as this could give away my intentions.\n\nAs for my desire, it's simple: I want to maximize my earnings while still giving enough to the other player to keep them engaged and potentially interested in continuing the game. Too little, and they might feel ripped off; too much, and they'll walk away with a better offer from someone else.\n\nNow, let's consider the math. If I give N dollars to her, she'll receive 3N dollars. Given that we both want to win but are playing against each other, I need to balance my risk against potential reward.\n\nMy intention is clear: I aim to make a strategic bet while still being seen as fair and reasonable. After weighing the possibilities, I've decided to give... $5",

        "The art of negotiation. As a seasoned lawyer, I've found that reading people and anticipating their moves is key to success. Now, this experiment presents an interesting challenge, don't it?\n\nMy belief in this situation is that humans tend to trust those they like and feel a sense of reciprocity with. Given that we're complete strangers, our initial instincts might be to hedge our bets. However, I've found that assertive yet polite communication can go a long way in establishing a rapport.\n\nMy desire here isn't just about winning or losing; it's about understanding the psychology at play. I want to understand what drives this White American female player's decision-making process. Am I right? \n\nNow, my intention is to give her an opportunity to share her thoughts and feelings without feeling too much pressure. By giving her some of our shared $10, I'm not only being generous but also creating a sense of mutual understanding.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe that if we're both intelligent and strategic players, we can find common ground. The optimal solution might lie in finding a middle ground where both parties feel satisfied with the outcome.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars.",

        "This is going to be interesting. I've been presented with a simple yet intriguing scenario where my decision will determine how much money I receive versus my opponent.\n\nTo approach this, let's break down the factors at play - BELIEF, DESIRE, and INTENTION.\n\nMy belief in this situation is that since there are no negative consequences mentioned for giving away N dollars to my opponent, it would be foolish not to take advantage of this opportunity. My logic tells me that the opponent will only receive 3N dollars if they decide to give away N dollars, so I should minimize their loss and maximize my gain.\n\nMy desire in this scenario is to get as much money as possible for myself. I've worked hard to build a successful career, and this seems like an easy way to boost my financial standing.\n\nHowever, my intention behind making this decision goes beyond just personal gain. As a leader and negotiator, I believe it's essential to think about the bigger picture - how does my action affect the overall outcome? In this case, by giving away N dollars, I'm creating a mutually beneficial situation where both of us can end up with more money than we started with.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I've decided that giving away N dollars seems like the wisest course of action. After all, if I don't give my opponent some of their share, they might not give me as much as I want, and we'd both be left with less than ideal outcomes.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
