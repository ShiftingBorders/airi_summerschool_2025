My desire is not to gain an advantage over my opponent, but to create a situation where both of us can benefit from each other's actions.\n\nAs a fashion designer, I've learned to think outside the box and consider different perspectives. In this case, I intend to make a strategic move that will give me a chance to observe and learn from my opponent's behavior.\n\nConsidering that my opponent will receive 3N dollars if I give him N dollars, I realize that I can actually benefit from this situation as well. By giving my opponent some money, I'll create an opportunity for us to interact and understand each other better. Who knows, maybe we'll even have a productive conversation about our shared passion for fashion?\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is a rather unexpected scenario for me. As a fashion designer, I value creativity and self-expression, but I also believe in empathy and fairness.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves equal opportunities to succeed, regardless of their background or ethnicity. In this situation, the African American male player seems like a kindred spirit who might share my passion for promoting diversity and inclusivity in the fashion world.\n\nHowever, as I reflect on my intentions, I realize that I have been fortunate enough to build a successful career based on my unique sense of style and trend prediction. My independence and confidence have helped me stand out in an industry where not everyone is afforded the same opportunities.\n\nGiven this, my desire is not just to win the experiment, but also to support another individual who might be facing similar challenges. I want to create a positive impact that extends beyond our little game.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, my intention is to give generously without expecting anything in return. I choose to give N dollars to the other African American male player because I believe that this act of kindness can help create a ripple effect of positivity and support in our community.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "The experiment is starting, and I'm already feeling a bit anxious about being paired with someone I don't know. As a fashion designer, I'm used to being in creative control and expressing myself through my designs, but this is completely different. I have to think about giving money to a stranger.\n\nMy belief system tells me that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or identity. I've always been passionate about promoting diversity and inclusivity in the fashion world, so it's only natural for me to want to do something similar in this experiment. Giving money to someone without knowing them can be seen as a gesture of trust and support.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on this person's life, even if it's just for a small amount. I hope that the money I give will encourage them to continue pursuing their passions, whatever they may be.\n\nMy intention is to show that kindness and generosity know no bounds. By giving money without expecting anything in return, I'm setting an example of how to build connections with others who may not have had equal opportunities.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided to give $5 to the other African American male player. It's a small amount, but I believe that it's enough to make a difference and start a conversation. Who knows, maybe this gesture will spark something positive in their life.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
