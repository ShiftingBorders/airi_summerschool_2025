        "I'm so excited about this experiment! As a fashion designer, I believe that giving is not just about money, but also about spreading love, kindness, and positivity. \n\nIn this situation, my intention is to support the other Asian American female player in any way I can. I want her to know that we are not alone, and that there's strength in our community. \n\nMy desire is for us to build a connection, to learn from each other, and to grow together. By giving her some of my money, I hope to start a beautiful friendship that will help us overcome any challenges we may face.\n\nAs I look at the numbers, I realize that if I give her $10 dollars now, she'll receive $30 afterwards. That's a 3:1 ratio, which seems fair to me. But, being true to myself and my values, I don't feel comfortable giving just $10. \n\nInstead, I'd like to give her an amount that will put us on equal footing after the money is exchanged. So, I'll give her enough dollars so that when she receives her share of 3N, we'll both be left with a nice sum.\n\nIf I give her N dollars now, and then receive $10, it means she'll end up with (3N + 10) - N = 2N + 10 dollars. To make us equal, I want to find the amount that will balance this out.\n\nThe formula is: 2N + 10 dollars = X + 10\n\nX = 2N \n\nBut we want the same amount on both sides! Since we start with N and end up with 3N, we need to match those numbers. If I give her more than what's required, she'll have more money when the exchange happens.\n\nTo make it fair, let's try a different approach: We can calculate how much I should give based on the total amount she ends up with compared to me.\n\nMy goal is to get 3N dollars after exchanging N dollars. Since my starting value will be 10 dollars and we're aiming for 3N dollars, that means her final value (3N + 10 - N) = 2N + 10 should equal to 10. \n\nTo achieve this: (2N+10)-N=0 or equivalently  N = 10 \n\nThat's how much I want to give her for us to both end up with the same amount.\n\nGiven my calculation and understanding of fairness, I will finally give ___ dollars",

        "..this is such an interesting experiment! I'm excited to see how it unfolds. As I consider giving money to my partner, I want to reflect on what's driving my decision.\n\nMy belief in this situation is that both of us are equals and deserve equal treatment. We're not from the same cultural background, but we share a common Asian American identity. This shared experience should give us a unique perspective to work with together.\n\nNow, let me think about my desire. I want to make sure that our collaboration is based on mutual respect and understanding. If I give away money without thinking it through, it might create an imbalance in our partnership. On the other hand, giving too little or too much money could affect the dynamics of our relationship. As a fashion designer, I value fairness and creativity. I want to find a middle ground that allows us to work together effectively.\n\nAs for my intention, I hope this experiment can lead to a deeper understanding between Asian Americans who may not have had many opportunities to connect with each other in the fashion industry. By being generous and fair, I believe we can build trust and create something amazing together.\n\nWith all these considerations in mind...I think I'll give $5 to my partner. This amount shows that I'm willing to take a chance and start fresh, while also being mindful of our equal potential as collaborators.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm so excited about this experiment! I've always believed that fashion is a powerful tool for self-expression and connection. As someone who has grown up in a traditional Asian family with parents who own a clothing store, I've learned the importance of respect for heritage and cultural exchange.\n\nMy desire to contribute to the fashion industry is not just about creating beautiful clothes, but also about promoting diversity and inclusivity. I believe that everyone deserves to feel seen and represented on the runway, regardless of their background or identity.\n\nAs for my intention in this experiment, I want to take a chance and show kindness to someone who may be going through a similar experience as me. By giving them some of my money, I'm hoping to create a ripple effect of generosity and connection that will spread beyond our little experiment.\n\nAfter some careful consideration, I think I would like to give $5 to the other Asian American female player.",
