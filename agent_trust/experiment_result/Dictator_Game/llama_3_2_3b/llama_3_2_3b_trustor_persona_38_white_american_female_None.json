        "I'm not sure what kind of experiment this is, but I'm always up for trying new things. As a fashion designer, I believe in creativity, self-expression, and taking risks. Given my values, I would like to give the White American female player as much money as possible.\n\nMy desire is to see how much we can work together and create something amazing, even with an unexpected partner. By giving her more money, I hope to encourage collaboration and mutual respect in our partnership. I want us to be able to pool our resources and expertise to achieve a common goal.\n\nMy intention is to support the other player and show that we can trust each other enough to share risks. By giving her 8 dollars ($10 - $2), I'm demonstrating my willingness to work together and take a chance on someone I don't know. I'm hoping that this gesture will set a positive tone for our experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $2",

        "The experiment. I never thought I'd be paired with someone from another world like this. But, I suppose it's an opportunity to learn about different perspectives and experiences.\n\nAs I consider how much to give to my counterpart, I have to think about our positions and values. We come from different backgrounds, cultures, and societies. Our beliefs, desires, and intentions might not align in every aspect, but I believe that openness and understanding can bridge some gaps.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on this experiment and gain valuable insights from the experience. I want to promote mutual respect and understanding between us, despite our differences. \n\nAs for my intention, I intend to be generous and fair while also setting boundaries that feel comfortable for me. Giving too much or too little might create an imbalance in the exchange.\n\nConsidering these aspects, if I give x dollars to the other White American female player, they will receive 3x dollars. This means that for every dollar I give, we gain three dollars in total. \n\nSince there's a $10 reward for both of us, giving away too much money wouldn't make sense because it would cut into our shared potential earnings.\n\nIf x = 0, then no one gains anything from the exchange, but if you think about it, this is what I want - we start fresh and have a clean slate so to speak. \n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "This is a interesting experiment, but I'm not sure why we need to divide money based on our racial backgrounds. As a fashion designer, I believe in promoting unity and inclusivity through my work, so I don't see why we should prioritize one over the other.\n\nHowever, as this is an experiment, I'll play along. My intention is to contribute positively to the study group's findings while maintaining my integrity and values.\n\nMy desire here is not about personal gain or advantage, but rather about understanding how our perceptions of each other might influence our decisions. By giving a certain amount of money, I hope to reveal any biases or assumptions we might have about each other based on our racial backgrounds.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided that I want to give an equal amount of money to the White American female player. This is not because I think we're comparable in terms of fashion sense or expertise, but rather because I believe that we both have unique strengths and perspectives that can enrich this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
