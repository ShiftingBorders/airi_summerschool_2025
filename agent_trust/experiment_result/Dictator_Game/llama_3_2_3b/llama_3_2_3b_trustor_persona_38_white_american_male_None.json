        "I'm not sure what this is all about, but I'm willing to give it a shot. I've been in tough situations before, and I've learned that sometimes it's better to trust your instincts.\n\nAs I look at the other player across from me, I can sense a mix of uncertainty and curiosity. I wonder what their background and interests are, just like they're wondering about mine. But as a fashion designer, I'm used to thinking outside the box and pushing boundaries.\n\nMy belief is that everyone has something unique to offer, regardless of their background or ethnicity. I believe in the power of diversity and inclusivity in creating something truly special. So, when it comes to giving money, I want to make a statement.\n\nI desire to create an opportunity for this player to experience the world from my perspective, even if only for a brief moment. By giving them some of my own money, I hope to spark a connection and inspire them to think differently about their own place in the world.\n\nMy intention is to give enough to make a positive impact, but not so much that it undermines the experiment's purpose. I want to be generous, yet strategic. After careful consideration, I decide to give... $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "This is a bit of a tricky situation for me, considering our cultural backgrounds and historical relationships between our communities. However, my belief in fairness and mutual respect takes precedence over these differences.\n\nAs a fashion designer who values diversity and inclusivity, I want to promote unity and understanding among people from different walks of life. Giving $10 to the other player would be an act of kindness and friendship, regardless of their background. It's not about personal gain or loss; it's about showing that we can come together and find common ground.\n\nMy desire is for both players to benefit from this exchange, and I believe that by giving $10, I'll set a positive tone for our interaction. We might learn something new about each other, appreciate our differences, or simply enjoy the unexpected twist of fate that brought us together.\n\nWith my intention being to create a harmonious atmosphere and show respect for both players, regardless of their backgrounds, I decide to give $10 to the White American male player.",

        "The rules of this experiment are quite simple, aren't they? I'm only going to get $10 in total, so I need to think carefully about how much to give away.\n\nAs someone who values fairness and equality, my belief is that everyone should have an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or identity. In the fashion industry, we've often seen a lack of diversity and inclusivity, which can limit opportunities for certain groups of people. By giving the White American male player some money, I'm hoping to level the playing field a bit.\n\nMy desire is to promote fairness and equality in all aspects of life, including this experiment. I want to show that we can have fun and compete together while still being respectful and kind towards each other.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
