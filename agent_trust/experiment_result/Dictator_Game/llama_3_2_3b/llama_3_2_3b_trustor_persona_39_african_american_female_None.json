        "I'm so excited to be part of this experiment! I've always been passionate about solving problems and working collaboratively with others, so this feels like a great fit for me.\n\nAs I consider giving money to my partner, I want to make sure we both get the best outcome possible. My belief is that by working together and sharing our skills and resources, we can achieve something even more amazing than what either of us could accomplish alone.\n\nMy desire is to build trust and a strong foundation for our partnership. Since we're strangers, I want to start with a small gesture that shows I'm willing to invest in our relationship. Giving N dollars to my partner feels like a responsible step towards creating a mutually beneficial situation.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I take a moment to reflect on this experiment and what it means for me. As I consider how much money to give to my paired partner, I draw upon my belief in fairness and collaboration. I believe that we're all in this together, and that our individual strengths and talents can be amplified when we work towards a common goal.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive experience for both of us. I want to establish trust and build a connection with someone who may share similar interests and values. By showing generosity and kindness upfront, I hope to set the tone for a productive and supportive partnership.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I consider my intention. My intention is not just about giving money; it's about demonstrating empathy and understanding. I want to show that I value our shared humanity and am willing to invest in our relationship. By giving a portion of my reward to my paired partner, I'm sending a message that I'm committed to working together towards a common success.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to give $5 to my paired partner. This amount may seem small compared to what I could have gotten back, but it reflects my desire to build trust and establish a sense of mutual respect. By doing so, I hope to create a foundation for a positive and collaborative experience that will benefit both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm excited to be part of this experiment! As I think about giving money to another person, I believe that fairness and equality are essential values in any interaction. I want to make sure that both parties benefit from our exchange.\n\nMy desire is to help my fellow player, but I also want to consider the potential outcome of our collaboration. If we work together well, we can achieve great things and potentially earn more money than if we were competing individually. However, if we don't get along, it could lead to a negative experience for both of us.\n\nWith that in mind, my intention is to make a gift of $5 to the other African American female player. By giving her $5, I'm showing my willingness to cooperate and work together towards a common goal. This small act of kindness can help set a positive tone for our collaboration and create an opportunity for us to build a strong partnership.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
