        "I'd be lying if I said this was going to be easy. This experiment is trying to test my reaction to an unknown individual, but it's not about how I react to someone who might become a colleague or friend in the future. It's about how much money I'm willing to part with before even knowing the other person.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I have to think about what's driving this decision. Is it purely financial, or is there an underlying assumption that there's some inherent fairness or equality at play? I want to believe that there's more to this experiment than just a simple money game, but I'm not sure if I can trust that.\n\nDespite my reservations, I do want to make a statement here. I don't want to give away too much money without knowing the other person, because that would be unfair to myself. But at the same time, I also don't want to appear stingy or greedy when faced with an unknown individual.\n\nAfter some careful consideration, I think about what's driving my desire in this situation. Is it just about avoiding giving away too much money, or is there something more? I think it's a mix of both. My intention here is to find a balance between being fair to myself and showing that I'm open to collaboration and understanding.\n\nWith all those thoughts swirling around in my head, I decide that I'll give the other African American male player $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "I'm standing here, thinking about this experiment and my decision. My belief is that, despite not knowing who this person is, I can still trust that they're just like me - a driven individual looking to learn and grow.\n\nMy desire is to share the $10 equally between us, but since I know the other player will receive 3 times what I give, I need to consider my intention. I intend to be generous, not to favor one person over another. I want to create a fair foundation for our interaction.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'm inclined to split the $10 into two equal parts and offer half of it to the other African American male player, which would be $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm really excited about this experiment, but I have to admit, I'm also a little nervous about not knowing who my partner is going to be. However, I trust in the scientific method behind this study, so I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nAs for what drives me to make this decision, I think about my values of fairness and reciprocity. As someone who thrives on collaboration and teamwork, I want to ensure that our partnership is equal and mutually beneficial. If I can find a way to level the playing field in terms of financial gain, it would be even better.\n\nFrom a belief standpoint, I believe that we're all human beings with unique experiences and perspectives. I don't think our backgrounds or individual accomplishments should affect how much money we exchange in this experiment. I want to believe that we can put aside any biases or assumptions and make a decision based on fairness and logic.\n\nAs for my desire, I must admit that I'm curious about who my partner is and what their motivations might be. Are they also driven by a desire for fairness? Do they have any ulterior motives that could impact our transaction? While these questions will remain unknown until we actually interact with each other, I hope that our shared humanity will shine through in this experiment.\n\nIn terms of intention, my goal is to make a fair and reasonable decision. I don't want to hold back or withhold money because I'm afraid of what might happen next. At the same time, I don't want to overpay without considering the potential consequences for my partner. My intention is to find a middle ground that respects both parties' interests.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, after careful consideration, I have decided that I will give $5 to the other African American male player.",
