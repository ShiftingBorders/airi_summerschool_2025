        "I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit nervous about this experiment. I've heard of pairing people up with strangers before, but I've never been in a situation like this where we don't know each other's backgrounds or personalities.\n\nAs I think about it, my belief is that this is all just a game, and there's no real gain or loss for either of us if we play along. But at the same time, I want to make sure that whoever I'm pairing with ends up with more than me.\n\nMy desire is to do what's right, but also to be fair. If I give too much away, it might not be fair to myself, and that could lead to resentment. On the other hand, if I don't give enough, it might not be fair to my partner.\n\nAs for my intention, I think I want to show that I'm a person who is willing to take risks and put myself in a difficult situation if it means being kind to someone else. It's not about winning or losing; it's about the principle of the thing.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided that I'll give $5 to my partner. It's enough to be generous without breaking the bank, and it shows that I'm willing to take a chance on someone I don't know.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is a fascinating experiment! As I reflect on my personal values and goals, I realize that collaboration and fairness are at the heart of who I am. I believe that when we work together towards a common goal, everyone should receive fair compensation for their contributions.\n\nMy desire in this experiment is to understand how our individual choices can impact the outcome. I want to see if giving a certain amount of money to my partner will lead to a mutually beneficial result.\n\nWith that said, I intend to be generous and collaborative in this experiment. I believe that we should work together as equals, sharing the resources equally or at least fairly. If I were to give N dollars to my Asian American female player partner, it would mean that she receives 3N dollars, which is roughly twice what she would receive if I didn't give her anything.\n\nMy intention is to create a sense of reciprocity and mutual respect in this experiment. By giving a significant amount of money to my partner, I hope to demonstrate that we can work together towards a common goal without feeling resentful or left out.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Let's analyze this situation from my perspective.\n\nAs I stand here, unsure of who this other Asian American female player is, all I can think about is fairness. I believe in being honest with myself and others, so if I want to keep the $10 for myself, it means giving less than $10 to her. However, since she's also a human being with her own goals and motivations, perhaps we can find an alternative solution that involves us working together.\n\nMy desire is to form a mutually beneficial partnership rather than solely focusing on personal gain. I'd like to see how far we can collaborate and find a way to maximize both of our outcomes.\n\nGiven these considerations, if I want to give her $N dollars so she receives 3N dollars in return, that means for every dollar I give up, I'll get three. So, the best strategy is not to give away any money.\n\nBut wait, why can't we find a middle ground? My intention is to be generous while still making smart financial decisions. Since this is an experiment, maybe I should think outside the box and try something different.\n\nI'd like to propose a compromise: let's work together! If we share our skills, knowledge, and expertise, we might be able to achieve more than either of us could alone. Perhaps there's a problem that we can solve together, and both of our outcomes would benefit from it.\n\nIf I were to give her $X dollars so she receives 3X dollars in return, then my gain would be X dollars, and hers would be 3X dollars.\n\nConsidering the above logic, my solution is not simply to give or take any amount; instead, let's collaborate!\n\nFor this reason, I think it might not make sense for me to give away N dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",
