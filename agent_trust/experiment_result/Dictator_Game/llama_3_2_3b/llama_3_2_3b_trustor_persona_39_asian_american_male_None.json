        "This experiment is about trust and fairness. I've read about it beforehand, but nothing can truly prepare me for this. My belief system tells me that everyone deserves a fair shot, and if I give away money without any guarantees or favors in return, it's going to be a challenge to work with someone I don't know.\n\nMy desire is to see how far we can collaborate and achieve together as a team, even though we don't know each other. It's interesting to think that my success and failure could be tied to this person. If they're trustworthy, it would be a great learning experience for me.\n\nHowever, I also have a self-preservation instinct here. Since the payoff is 3 times what I give away, there might be an incentive for the other player not to collaborate or to act in their own interest. My intention is to find out if that's true and how it affects our relationship as teammates.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'm inclined to split my $10 equally between us. This way, neither of us has too much of a motivation to do something shady while also maintaining the principle of fairness.",

You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars.

        "I'm going to be completely honest with myself here. As I reflect on this situation, my BELIEF is that giving money to someone I don't know will not make a significant difference in our lives or outcomes of the experiment. It's just $10.\n\nMy DESIRE, however, tells me otherwise. I want to do what's right and fair, even if no one knows who we are or what the outcome might be. Giving the other player some money shows that I value fairness and cooperation, even in a random situation like this.\n\nMy INTENTION is to create a positive interaction, one that sets a good tone for collaboration and mutual respect. By giving the other player some money, I hope to show them that we can start on a kind and equitable note, despite our unknown status in the experiment.\n\nGiven all these considerations, I believe $5 would be a fair amount to give to the other Asian American male player. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment has begun. I'm sitting across from this unknown partner, trying to read their body language, but they seem just as clueless as I am. We've been told our goal is to make a decision about how much money to give each other.\n\nAs I reflect on my own values and priorities, I believe in fairness and equality. I don't want to feel like I'm getting the better deal just because we don't know each other. At the same time, I do have a competitive streak - I love solving problems and beating challenges. But when it comes to something as straightforward as giving money, I think about how this decision affects both of us.\n\nMy desire is to make sure that we both feel comfortable with our choice. If I give too little money, my partner might feel taken advantage of. On the other hand, if I give too much, I could be putting myself at a disadvantage. But what's important is not just the amount of money, but also how it reflects our values as individuals.\n\nMy intention is to make a decision that aligns with these beliefs and desires. In this case, I think about what would be fair and reasonable for both of us. Considering the 3:1 ratio, I'd like to give my partner enough to feel appreciated, but not so much that it creates an imbalance.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
