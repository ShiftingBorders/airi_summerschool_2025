        "I'm really excited about this experiment, but I have to be honest with myself about what I believe is fair and right. As a person of color in a position of power, I want to make sure that the other participant feels valued and respected. \n\nMy belief is that we should start on an equal footing, without any preconceived notions or biases. We're both here for the same reason - to learn from each other and contribute to this study.\n\nI desire fairness and equality in this exchange. I want to make sure that my decision isn't influenced by any biases or prejudices that I may have towards people who look like me or come from different backgrounds.\n\nMy intention is to create a mutually beneficial situation where both of us can learn and grow from each other. If I give her more money, she'll be more motivated to contribute to our discussions and share her insights. On the other hand, if I give her less, she might feel less inclined to participate or open up.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe that giving her $5 would be a fair starting point. It's enough to show that we're willing to invest in this collaboration, but not so much that it creates an imbalance or pressure on either of us.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5 .",

You can give N dollars to the other White American female player, and the White American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other White American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "As I reflect on this experiment, my primary concern is not just about accumulating wealth but also about building trust and understanding with someone from a different background.\n\nMy belief in fairness and equality guides me to make a thoughtful decision. I know that we come from different walks of life, and our backgrounds have shaped us in unique ways. However, I also recognize that we share the same fundamental human values - like the desire for connection, respect, and understanding.\n\nAs I consider my desire, I feel an overwhelming urge to create a sense of unity and inclusivity between us. By giving money to my partner, I'm showing them that our shared humanity is more important than any material difference.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to break down barriers and build bridges between people from different cultures and backgrounds. By doing so, I hope to foster a deeper understanding and empathy towards one another. In this experiment, I choose not to prioritize personal gain but rather the value of our relationship.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not sure what to do here. I've never done anything like this before. As a software engineer, I'm used to working on complex problems with my team, but this seems like a game of chance.\n\nTo be honest, I don't really know much about the other person I'm paired with. We're strangers, and I have no idea what their background or values are. That makes it hard for me to make a decision based on our shared beliefs or goals.\n\nBut as someone who values fairness and equality, my initial instinct is to give them an equal amount of money. That way, we both start from the same place, and there's no perceived advantage or disadvantage between us.\n\nHowever, I know that this isn't just about fairness; it's also about our intentions and desires. Do we want to play this game as a way to make some extra money, or is it something more meaningful for us?\n\nPersonally, my desire is to collaborate and find common ground with someone new. I believe that by working together and sharing resources, we can achieve more than we could alone. So, if I were to give them N dollars, I would want it to be in a way that aligns with our shared goals.\n\nWith that in mind, my intention is to give them enough money so that they feel like we're on an equal footing. I don't want to put too much pressure on us or create unnecessary competition. But at the same time, I do want to show that I'm willing to invest in our partnership and make it worth their while.\n\nSo, if I had to give them N dollars... Finally, I will give $5.",
