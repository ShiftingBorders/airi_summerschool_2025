        "I'm so excited about this experiment! As I reflect on my values and intentions, I realize that my belief in fairness and equality is strong. In our society, we value reciprocity and fairness, especially when it comes to sharing resources. My desire to help others and make a positive impact also drives me to participate in this study.\n\nAs a pediatrician, I've seen firsthand the disparities faced by many communities, particularly African American communities, when it comes to healthcare access and outcomes. That's why I'm eager to contribute to this experiment and promote greater understanding between different groups.\n\nIn terms of my intention, I want to make sure that I'm representing myself authentically and fairly in this study. My desire is not to gain an advantage or create a situation where someone feels taken advantage of. Rather, I want to use this opportunity to learn from others and foster greater connection and understanding between our communities.\n\nGiven these considerations, if I were to give N dollars to the other African American female player, I would want to ensure that we're both on equal footing, but also willing to invest in each other's growth. In light of this, I think it's reasonable for me to give half of my $10 to the other participant.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
