        "I'm really curious about this experiment! I've never been part of anything like it before. From what I understand, we'll be playing a game where we have to decide how much money to give to our partner.\n\nAs I sit here and think about it, I want to make sure that my decision is guided by my values as a pediatrician. My patients are always at the center of everything I do, and I believe in putting their needs first. In this situation, I have to consider the well-being of someone I've just met, but who will likely receive a significant amount of money from me.\n\nMy desire to help others is strong, and I want to use this opportunity to show kindness and generosity to my partner. I think about all the times I've received care and compassion as a child, and how it made a difference in my life. I want to offer that same kind of support and understanding to someone who will be receiving more money than they know what to do with.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I realize that I have to make a decision based on my intention. My intention is not just to play the game or follow instructions, but to use this opportunity to promote kindness and generosity in our society. I want to show that even small acts of kindness can have a big impact when they come from a place of love and compassion.\n\nWith all these thoughts swirling in my head, I decide to give my partner half of what I'd like to keep for myself. That way, we both get something, but the majority of the money goes towards promoting kindness and generosity.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "I'm not sure what's going on with this experiment, but I'm willing to play along. As a pediatrician, my goal is always to help others, even if it means giving up something of value.\n\nIn this situation, the rules say I can give N dollars to the other player and they'll receive 3N dollars in return. That's a pretty big incentive, but as a doctor, I'm not just motivated by money. My belief is that everyone deserves a fair chance, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on someone's life, even if it's just for a moment. I want to help this other person, and I believe giving them some of my own money is the right thing to do.\n\nAs I think about it, I realize that this isn't just about the money - it's about building trust and showing kindness. My intention is to take a chance on someone who might not have much, but could use a little help.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not sure where to start with this. I'm already feeling a bit anxious about giving someone money, but I know it's all part of this experiment. As a pediatrician, I've always been taught to put the needs of others first and to act with kindness and compassion.\n\nAs I think about my belief system, I believe that everyone deserves respect and fairness. In this situation, I don't know who this person is or what their situation is like, but I want to treat them with dignity and kindness. My intention is to give to someone in need, not to exploit or take advantage of them.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on someone's life, even if it's just financially. I've seen firsthand the struggles that families face when they're unable to afford basic needs like healthcare or medication for their children. I want to help alleviate some of that burden.\n\nAs for my decision-making process, I'm trying to approach this situation with an open mind and without any preconceptions. I want to trust that whoever this person is, they will use the money in a way that's beneficial to them and to our community.\n\nSo, taking all of these factors into consideration, I've decided to give $5 to the other Asian American male player.",
