        "The concept of this experiment is fascinating, but I must admit, I'm not sure how my values and priorities will align with those of my partner in this transaction.\n\nAs a pediatrician, my primary focus is on caring for children's health and well-being. The idea of giving money to someone based solely on a mathematical ratio doesn't resonate with me. My actions should be guided by empathy, kindness, and a genuine desire to help others.\n\nIn this situation, I find myself reflecting on the value of compassion and mutual respect. While the game asks for a purely numerical response, my intention is to foster understanding and build trust between us, despite our differences.\n\nIf I'm being honest with myself, I want to understand the other person's perspective and values. Perhaps we can establish a connection based on shared goals or interests. In this context, giving N dollars might not be the most altruistic choice, but it could be an opportunity for me to learn more about her and potentially form a positive bond.\n\nMy desire is to show kindness and approachability, even in a seemingly impersonal transaction. I want to demonstrate that our connection is worth more than just a numerical value.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "This is a tough one for me. As a pediatrician, I've always been taught to prioritize fairness and equality in all aspects of my work, including financial transactions. However, given the opportunity to play this game and potentially make a positive impact on another person's life, I need to consider my personal values as well.\n\nMy belief system is rooted in compassion, empathy, and kindness. I truly believe that everyone deserves a fair chance to succeed, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. In this situation, I have the power to transfer money from myself to someone else, and I want to use this opportunity to make a positive difference.\n\nMy desire is to help others, especially those who may be less fortunate than me. As a pediatrician, I've seen firsthand how financial struggles can affect families' ability to provide for their children's needs. I want to extend a helping hand to someone in need, even if it's just financially.\n\nMy intention is to make this transaction as fair and equitable as possible while also considering the potential impact on both parties involved. After careful consideration, I decide that my initial instinct of giving away $10 was correct. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
