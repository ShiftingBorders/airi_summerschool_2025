        "This is a tough one. As a pediatrician, I've always been taught to put others before myself and prioritize the well-being of my patients. However, in this experiment, I have to make a decision based on my personal belief, desire, and intention.\n\nMy belief is that if I give away money without expecting anything in return, it aligns with the values of empathy, kindness, and generosity that I strive for as a doctor. I believe that the distribution should be fair, and giving 1 dollar would ensure that both of us receive something.\n\nHowever, my desire is to make the other person happy, but not at the expense of my own well-being. As someone who comes from a family where education and career success are highly valued, I have to consider my own financial situation and how giving away money might impact it.\n\nMy intention is to make this decision based on what I think is fair and equitable. Since I'm being paid $10 for participating in the experiment, I should receive something comparable if we're going to play this game fairly. Given that the other player will receive 3 times as much as me if I give away N dollars, I need to determine how much I want to give.\n\nGiven all of these considerations, I would decide to give the White American male player $1 so that both players could potentially earn something but maintaining my own financial stability is also important. \n\nFinally, I will give  $1",

        "I've been paired with someone from a different background, and I'm curious about their perspective. As a pediatrician, I believe in treating all patients with respect and kindness, regardless of their cultural or socio-economic background.\n\nMy desire is to understand the other person's values and beliefs, so that I can make an informed decision about how much money to give them. Since I don't know them personally, I'll have to rely on my intuition and empathy.\n\nFrom what little I've observed during our interactions, it seems like they're a straightforward person who values honesty and fairness. They seem willing to listen and consider different perspectives, which is essential for building trust.\n\nGiven these observations, my intention is to give them an amount that will demonstrate my willingness to collaborate and find a mutually beneficial solution. Since I don't want to advantage myself at their expense, but rather create a sense of equality, I'll choose an amount that's fair and reasonable.\n\nConsidering the 3:1 ratio, I think it would be too lopsided if I gave them more than $10. However, giving them just $10 might not convey my willingness to collaborate as effectively. Therefore, I've decided to give them a compromise amount that falls somewhere in between these extremes.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I want to make sure I'm making the right decision here. As a pediatrician, I've dedicated my life to caring for children, and I believe that includes showing kindness and compassion towards everyone, regardless of their background. When it comes to this experiment, I'm not just thinking about myself; I'm thinking about how my actions might impact the other person.\n\nMy belief is that we're all in this together, and we should try to make the world a better place for everyone. My desire is to see someone else benefit from our little exchange of money, and my intention is to be generous and fair.\n\nI think about how I would feel if I were in his shoes - if someone had given me $10 out of the blue, with no strings attached. It's a nice gesture, and it makes me feel good as a person.\n\nConsidering all this, I've decided to give him half of my share: $5.",
