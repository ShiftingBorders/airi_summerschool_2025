        "I'm not sure what kind of game this is, but I'm willing to play along. As a chef, I believe in creating something beautiful and delicious with every dish I make. Now, when it comes to sharing my money with someone I don't know, my first instinct is to protect myself.\n\nHowever, as I think about the experiment and the amount of money at stake, I realize that I'm not just giving away money; I'm also gaining an opportunity to connect with someone new. My desire to learn more about this person and see if we can build a rapport is strong. I want to understand her values, interests, and personality.\n\nBut, as a perfectionist, my intention is still to make the most out of this situation while minimizing any potential risk. Given that I'll receive $10 and she'll get 3N dollars, I need to weigh the odds in my favor. I think about how much I can afford to give away without compromising my financial security.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided on a strategy. Since I don't know anything about her, I'll start with a small amount that shows I'm willing to take a chance. However, I won't give away too much, so I can still maintain control of the situation.\n\nI'll give her... $2.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "This is a tough one for me. I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment or who my partner will be. But, you know what? I believe that every person has something valuable to offer, regardless of their background or culture.\n\nMy desire is to make the best decision possible and to see how my instincts play out in a new situation. As a chef, I'm used to working with new ingredients and techniques, but this is a whole different ball game. I want to take a chance and be open-minded.\n\nAs for my intention, it's simple: I want to give the other person a fair shake and see if we can build something together. Maybe we'll discover that we have more in common than we think. Or maybe not. But I'm willing to take the risk.\n\nAfter considering all of this, I've decided to give N dollars to my partner. That way, both of us will start on equal footing and can see where things go from there.",

        "I'm not sure what's going on here, but I've been paired with some stranger who wants me to give her money. I don't know much about her, and she doesn't seem to know much about me either. All I know is that there's $10 involved, and I want to make a good impression.\n\nAs a chef, I'm used to working with ingredients that may not always be familiar to me, but I've learned to adapt and experiment with new flavors. Similarly, I'll have to navigate this situation with an open mind and a willingness to learn about my partner's perspective.\n\nMy belief is that honesty and trust are key in any interaction, so I'll be upfront about what I want to do with the money. My desire is to make a good impression and show that I'm a fair and generous person. And my intention is to give enough money to create a positive outcome for both of us.\n\nAfter considering my options, I think I'll give her $5 dollars. That way, she'll get some extra cash, and I'll still have a decent amount left over. It's a small gesture, but it could be the start of something positive between us.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",
