        "I don't know who this person is or what we're even doing together, but I'm willing to give it a shot. From my belief in fairness and reciprocity, I think I should give an equal amount of money. But at the same time, I want to make sure that whoever wins gets more than me because I believe that hard work and dedication deserve to be rewarded.\n\nAs for my desire, I really don't have any strong feelings towards this person one way or the other. Maybe it's because we're complete strangers? But if I'm being honest, I'd like to think that I'm a generous person who is willing to help others out, even if it's just in a small way.\n\nMy intention is to be fair and make sure that whoever gets more money does so for a good reason. Maybe there's something we can learn from each other or maybe we can collaborate on something cool. Either way, I think giving an equal amount would be a great starting point. So, I'm going to give ___ dollars",

        "The experiment! I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm always up for a challenge.\n\nAs I think about this, my belief is that in any kind of interaction or competition, it's all about being strategic and calculating. I believe that the key to success lies in understanding the dynamics of the situation and making informed decisions based on that understanding. So, when it comes to giving money to this other Asian American male player, I need to think carefully about how to position myself and what will give me an advantage.\n\nMy desire is to win, but not just for the sake of winning. I want to ensure that my actions are guided by a sense of fairness and respect. I don't know this person, so I need to approach the situation with an open mind and consider their perspective as well. It's about finding a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to maximize my chances of success in this experiment while still being seen as fair and reasonable by the other player. Given the 3N dollar reward for receiving N dollars from me, I need to weigh the benefits of giving money to him against what would be an unfair advantage if I were to take all the money for myself.\n\nAfter some careful consideration, I've decided that I'll give a relatively small amount of money to this other Asian American male player. Not so much that it feels too generous or condescending, but enough to make them feel like we're at least on an even playing field. Let's say... $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure what this experiment is all about, but I'm excited to take on the challenge. My belief in fairness and equality makes me want to give my partner a fair deal. Since the rules of the game favor him with triple the amount, I'd like to even the odds.\n\nAs a chef, I understand that sometimes you have to adjust your recipe to make it more appealing to your customers. In this case, I need to adjust my wallet to make it more appealing to my partner. However, as a perfectionist, I don't want to compromise on fairness.\n\nMy desire is to find a balance between giving and receiving. I want to give enough to make the game worth playing for both of us. My intention is to create a mutually beneficial situation where we both walk away happy.\n\nAfter some thought, I think I'll choose to give my partner $3 to start with. That way, we can see how things go and adjust accordingly. If this seems like a good starting point, I'm willing to add more money as the game progresses. But I'm not going to give too much upfront without knowing more about my partner.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",
