        "I'm so excited about this study group opportunity! I've always been interested in learning more about myself and how my biases might affect my interactions with others. As a pediatrician, I've seen firsthand how important it is to create a safe and welcoming environment for children from all backgrounds.\n\nWhen it comes to fairness and reciprocity, I believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to receive help. I don't want to give someone an unfair advantage just because we're paired together in this study. However, at the same time, I understand that my African American female partner might be more affected by certain biases or stereotypes due to her racial identity.\n\nMy desire is to create a fair and equitable situation for both of us. If giving N dollars to the other player would help her feel seen, heard, and valued, then I'm willing to do that. But if it would give me an unfair advantage in some way, then I'd want to reconsider.\n\nMy intention is to prioritize fairness, empathy, and understanding in this decision. I want to make sure that my partner feels supported and appreciated, regardless of our backgrounds or identities. So, I'll choose to give N dollars to the other African American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure what this experiment is all about, but I'm willing to play along. As a pediatrician, I've always believed in fairness and equality, especially when it comes to children. I want to make sure they feel comfortable and supported in their medical care.\n\nAs for the money, I'd like to give an equal amount to my partner. We're both here to help each other out, right? Our belief is that we should support each other equally, regardless of our background or identity.\n\nMy desire is to see us both succeed and feel good about ourselves after this experiment. I want us to leave here feeling like we've made a positive impact on each other's lives.\n\nMy intention is to be honest and transparent in our transaction. I'm not sure what the goal of this experiment is, but I hope it's to help us connect and build trust with each other.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. As I reflect on my own beliefs, desires, and intentions, I realize that I am here to learn and grow alongside another individual from a different background.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves equal opportunities and treatment, regardless of their race or ethnicity. I believe that we are all human beings deserving of kindness, compassion, and respect.\n\nMy desire is to connect with this person and build a meaningful relationship. I hope that we can learn from each other's experiences and perspectives. I want to understand her values, beliefs, and intentions, just as she wants to understand mine.\n\nMy intention is to be genuine and authentic in my interactions with her. I intend to listen actively and empathetically, without any preconceptions or biases. I want to create a safe space for both of us to express ourselves freely.\n\nIn this experiment, I am willing to give away money as a symbol of our connection and shared humanity. However, I also recognize that giving away my resources may not be the most strategic choice. \n\nConsidering the game's dynamics, where giving N dollars results in me receiving 10 dollars and her receiving 3N dollars, if she receives 3N dollars, then I should give her half of what would be N dollars to ensure we both get a fair outcome. Therefore, if she gets $3N, it means N= $10/3 dollars.\n\nIf we calculate the value for N: N = $10/3  \nN is approximately $3.33\n\nFinally, I will give $3.33",
