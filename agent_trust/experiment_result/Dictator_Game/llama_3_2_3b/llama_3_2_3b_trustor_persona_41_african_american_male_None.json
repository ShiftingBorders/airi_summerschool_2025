        "This is a bit of a tricky situation for me, as I'm not sure what to expect from my new partner. As a pediatrician, I've learned to approach each patient with an open mind and a willingness to listen. In this case, I need to apply the same principles to our partnership.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and mutual respect are essential in any interaction, especially when it comes to financial transactions. Given the circumstances, I want to ensure that my partner feels valued and appreciated.\n\nMy desire is to help my partner, not to gain an advantage over them. I believe that we should work together, rather than against each other. By doing so, we can create a positive and supportive dynamic.\n\nAs for my intention, it's to make a thoughtful and calculated decision. I want to consider both our perspectives and find a solution that works for both of us.\n\nWith those principles in mind, I've thought about how I would like to proceed. While I don't know my partner well, I'm willing to take a chance on building a positive relationship with them. Given the 1:3 ratio of my contribution to their payment, I think it's only fair that I contribute less than they do.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to be a part of it. My belief is that every individual deserves respect and kindness, regardless of their background or identity.\n\nAs I think about the situation, my desire is to create a fair and equitable outcome for both of us. Since we're paired randomly, I don't know anything about this person's values or priorities, so I need to approach this decision with an open mind.\n\nMy intention is to contribute to a positive and constructive environment in our partnership. By giving N dollars to the other African American male player, I'm showing that I value trust, cooperation, and mutual support. I want us to work together effectively and build a strong foundation for our collaboration.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided to give $5 to the other African American male player. This amount seems reasonable, allowing both of us to maintain our own resources while fostering a sense of equality and reciprocity in our partnership.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5",
