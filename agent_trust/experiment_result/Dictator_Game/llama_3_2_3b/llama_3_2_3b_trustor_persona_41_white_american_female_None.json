        "I'm not sure what this experiment is about, but I'm willing to give it a try. As a pediatrician, I've always believed in the importance of fairness and reciprocity, especially when it comes to working with others.\n\nMy desire to be generous and kind is driven by my experience as a doctor. I've seen firsthand how a small act of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life. When I'm working with patients and their families, I always try to put myself in their shoes and see things from their perspective.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to be honest and transparent about my feelings. While I may not know the other player well, I believe that it's essential to approach this experiment with an open mind and a willingness to learn from each other. My goal is not to \"win\" or gain some advantage, but rather to understand how this experiment works and how we can both benefit from our interaction.\n\nWith those beliefs, desires, and intentions in mind, I've decided that I want to give the White American female player half of my $10. This way, we're both starting on an equal footing, and we can see where this experiment takes us.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. I'm only in it for the $10, but at the same time, I feel like I need to do something nice for this other person who is going to be sharing my $10.\n\nAs I think about giving money to someone else, I realize that my desire to make a positive impact comes from my upbringing and my passion for helping others. Growing up with parents who are both doctors has taught me the importance of compassion and kindness, especially when it comes to vulnerable populations like children. My volunteer work at the local children's hospital has also shown me the value of giving back to the community.\n\nMy intention is not just about following some mathematical formula, but about doing something that aligns with my values as a person. I want to create a positive interaction with this stranger, and I believe that giving them some money will be a kind gesture that sets a good tone for our exchange.\n\nSo, after considering my options, I decide to give the other White American female player half of my $10. It's not a lot, but it's something from the heart, and I hope it makes her day a little brighter.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As a pediatrician, I've always tried to put others before myself and help those in need.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality should be the guiding principles of any interaction, including financial ones. Given that I have no prior relationship or connection with my paired partner, I believe it's only right that we both receive the same amount if we choose to contribute to each other.\n\nAs for what motivates me, it's my desire to make a positive impact on people's lives. I believe that even small acts of kindness and generosity can have a significant effect when combined with others. In this case, I want to demonstrate that being fair and equitable is not only the right thing to do but also aligns with my personal values.\n\nMy intention here is to follow the principles of fairness and reciprocity. Since we're paired randomly and don't know each other, I believe it's essential to treat each other as equals and make a decision based on that assumption. I'm willing to put myself in her shoes and consider what would be reasonable under these circumstances.\n\nGiven all this, I'd like to give my partner $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
