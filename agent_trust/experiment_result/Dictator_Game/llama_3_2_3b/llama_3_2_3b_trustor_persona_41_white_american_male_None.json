        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to participate. As I think about giving money to someone I don't know, my first instinct is to consider fairness and reciprocity. My desire to be seen as a trustworthy and caring person might lead me to choose an amount that's reasonable and fair.\n\nFrom a philosophical standpoint, I believe in the importance of kindness and generosity towards others. However, I also recognize that this is a game, and there are no guarantees or consequences for my actions. With that said, my intention is to give enough money to show respect and appreciation for our shared participation in this experiment.\n\nAfter some reflection, I've decided on an amount that feels fair and generous. Considering the rules of the game, where the other player will receive three times what I give, I don't want to feel like I'm being taken advantage of if they choose a very large amount. At the same time, I want to show my kindness and willingness to cooperate.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "This is so strange. I don't know this person at all, but I want us to work together well. As a pediatrician, my whole career has been built on putting others first and making sure everyone feels seen and heard.\n\nMy belief is that we're both humans here, deserving of respect and kindness. I want us to trust each other enough to have open and honest communication. I believe in the importance of empathy and active listening in any partnership or collaboration.\n\nMy desire is for us to succeed together. I want this experiment to be a success, not just for my own benefit, but also for the sake of our study group. We can learn so much from each other, and I truly believe that we have something valuable to share.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give to the other player, I'm reminded of the countless times I've put others before myself. As a doctor, I've dedicated my life to caring for children who need me most. I know what it's like to be in their shoes, to feel scared and unsure. That's why I want to show kindness and generosity to this stranger.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "Let me think about this for a moment.\n\nI believe that the money we exchange is just that - money. It's not personal, but rather a part of a scientific experiment to see how people interact with each other in a transactional setting. \n\nAs I consider what to do, my desire to be seen as kind and compassionate comes into play. I want to make sure the White American male player feels valued and respected, even if we don't know much about each other. However, I also need to think about how this interaction will affect our working relationship in the study group.\n\nMy intention is not to gain anything from this transaction; it's simply a way for us to get to know each other better. I want to build trust and create a positive atmosphere in the experiment.\n\nGiven these factors, I've decided that I'd like to give a fair amount of money to the White American male player. Since we're not expecting much from each other initially, I think a small gesture will go a long way in setting a good tone for our interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars .",
