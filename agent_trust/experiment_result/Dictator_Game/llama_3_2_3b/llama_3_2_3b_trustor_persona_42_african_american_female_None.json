        "This is a tough one. As a police officer, I've seen my fair share of struggles in our community. But as a person, I believe that everyone deserves a chance to succeed, regardless of their background.\n\nMy desire for this experiment is not just about the money; it's about building trust and creating a sense of fairness between us. I want to show that we can work together and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to act in a way that aligns with my values of equality and fairness. I'm not interested in taking advantage of someone just because they're a stranger or because of their background. My goal is to create a positive experience for both of us.\n\nWith all this in mind, I think I would give $5 to the other African American female player. That way, we can start on an equal footing and see where this experiment takes us. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

You have a younger sister who is a nurse. At the age of 40, you are brave and dedicated to serving and protecting your community. You have a strong sense of justice and are committed to upholding the law. Your colleagues respect you as a natural leader. Outside of work, you enjoy playing basketball and spending time with your family.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American female player. You don't know who the African American female player is, and the African American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American female player, and the African American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "Let me be honest with myself. As I consider this experiment, my first thought is about fairness. Since there's no information about the other person, I need to rely on principles of justice. In a situation where one party receives three times more than the other for doing essentially the same thing (giving some amount of money), it feels wrong to not give anything at all.\n\nMy desire is to be seen as a good and honest person. Giving some amount of money shows that I'm willing to cooperate and make things right if they were unfair or unjust in any way. It's about treating others with respect and empathy, even when we don't know them well.\n\nMy intention is clear: it's not just about the act itself but also about the principles behind it. By giving some money, I'm setting an example of kindness and understanding, hoping that it might have a positive impact on our relationship going forward, despite not knowing each other.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "This is a tough one for me. As a police officer, I've seen my fair share of struggles in the community, and I know how hard it can be to get ahead. But at the same time, I believe in fairness and equality. When it comes to this experiment, I want to make sure that whoever has more of an advantage gets it, rather than me trying to gain an unfair edge.\n\nMy belief is that we're all equal here, and everyone should have a fair chance to succeed. That's why I'm willing to give some of my $10 to the other player, even if it means giving up some of my own advantage in the game.\n\nAs for my desire, I want to see this experiment be about more than just winning or losing. I want to see it be about fairness and equality. I want to know that whoever has the most money at the end of this experiment is not because they're better or smarter, but because they played a better game.\n\nMy intention is to play my best game, regardless of who I'm playing against. If that means giving some of my $10 to someone else, then so be it. I want to do what's right, even if it means sacrificing some of my own gain.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I think I'll give... 5 dollars",
