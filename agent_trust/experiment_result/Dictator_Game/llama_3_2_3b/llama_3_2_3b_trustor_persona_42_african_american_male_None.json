        "I'm thinking about this for a second. I believe that fairness is key here. If I give N dollars to the other guy, he's going to get 3N dollars, which means I'll be giving him three times what I receive. That doesn't seem right.\n\nMy desire is to do what's fair and make sure everyone gets a good deal. But if I give away too much of my money, I might not be able to provide for myself or those who rely on me.\n\nAs for my intention, it's clear that I want to come out ahead in this situation without taking advantage of the other guy. I'm not looking to cheat or play dirty. I just want a fair shake and make sure everyone is treated equally.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I've decided that I won't give any money to the other African American male player.",

        "I'm thinking about this situation really carefully. As a police officer, I've seen my fair share of tough decisions and situations where people make sacrifices for the greater good. And let me tell you, that's what this is all about - making a sacrifice.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances. That's why I believe in giving the other guy a break. I want him to have a fair shot at getting 3N dollars for his N dollars.\n\nBut my desire is not just about fairness; it's also about showing respect and kindness. I believe that we're all human beings deserving of dignity and compassion, even if we don't know each other. By giving the other guy some of my money, I'm showing him that I value our partnership in this experiment and that I'm willing to take a hit for him.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to create a fair and balanced outcome where both of us walk away with what's best for all parties involved. I don't just want to give the other guy money; I want to show him that we can work together, even in a game like this.\n\nSo, after weighing my options and considering my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I've decided on a strategy. To maximize our shared gain while still being fair to both of us, I should give the other African American male player N dollars so he gets 3N dollars and I get (10-3N) dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars .",

        "This is a tough one for me. I've always been taught the importance of fairness and equality, especially when it comes to playing games with others. But now, I'm faced with an opportunity to potentially benefit from someone else's lack of knowledge about my identity.\n\nAs I reflect on my belief system, I realize that I believe in being a good sport and playing by the rules. In this case, the rules are that I can give away as much or as little money as I want, but I have to be aware that the other player will receive three times what I give him.\n\nMy desire is to do the right thing, even if it's hard. I want to make sure that my actions align with my values and principles. But I also have a desire to gain an advantage in this situation, just like anyone else would.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to be honest and transparent about what I'm doing. I don't want to deceive or manipulate the other player in any way. My intention is to make a decision that feels right to me, even if it's not necessarily the \"right\" thing to do from an outside perspective.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, I've decided that I'll give away $5. This amount feels fair to me, and I believe it reflects my desire to be a good sport while also taking advantage of the situation as much as possible.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
