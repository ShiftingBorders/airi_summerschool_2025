        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As a police officer, I've learned to put myself in others' shoes and try to understand their perspectives.\n\nFrom what I know about my own life, I believe that giving money is not just about the amount of money itself, but about the intention behind it. If I genuinely care about the other player's well-being, I would want to help them out as much as possible.\n\nMy desire to give the maximum amount is driven by a sense of fairness and equality. Since the stakes are high for me, with only $10 at risk, I believe that giving more than my share is the right thing to do.\n\nAs I consider this experiment, my intention is clear: I want to build trust and foster a positive relationship with the other player, regardless of our backgrounds or affiliations. By giving generously, I hope to establish a sense of mutual respect and understanding.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "This is a tough one. As a police officer, I'm used to making split-second decisions in high-pressure situations, but this experiment feels different. It's not about saving lives or solving crimes; it's about personal gain.\n\nTo be honest, my initial thought is that I shouldn't give any money to the other player. I mean, we don't even know each other, and there's no clear reason why I should trust her. But then I think about my values as a police officer - fairness, integrity, and protecting the community. I want to make sure this experiment is conducted fairly and without any bias.\n\nMy desire for fairness and integrity kicks in here. I don't want to take advantage of someone just because they're not well-known or connected in some way. But at the same time, I'm human, and humans have desires. My desire for fairness might be clouded by a sense of altruism - I might feel like I should give some money just to make sure things are even.\n\nMy intention is clear, though: I want to make this experiment work without compromising my values or principles. I take a deep breath and decide to think about this objectively. What's the worst that could happen if I give her some money? Not much, right?\n\nI look at the math - I'd lose $10, and she'd gain $3N. If I can make myself trust her just enough, I might as well share a little bit of my wealth to ensure this experiment is conducted fairly.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar .",

        "This is a tough one. As a police officer, I've seen my fair share of struggles and injustices in our community. But, at the end of the day, I believe that we're all human beings deserving of respect and fairness.\n\nAs I think about this situation, I'm reminded of my grandfather's words: \"Michael, always do what you think is right, even if it's hard.\" That's exactly what I want to do here. My belief is that we should play fair and treat each other with kindness, regardless of our backgrounds or positions.\n\nNow, when it comes to my desire, I want to be true to myself and my values. As a leader in the police department, I've seen how even small gestures can make a big impact on someone's day. So, if I give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, she'll receive 3N dollars, which is a generous offer. But, what really matters here is not just about the money; it's about building trust and rapport with my partner.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to create a positive experience for both of us. By giving N dollars, I'm showing that I value fairness and equality in this partnership. I'm also hoping that she'll see the good in me and be willing to work together towards a common goal \u2013 which is to win this game!\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
