        "I've got to be honest with myself here. I believe it's not just about getting paid or doing something good for someone else's sake. It's about showing respect and fairness. We're all in this together as members of our community, and we should treat each other with kindness and integrity.\n\nAs a police officer, I've seen firsthand the impact that people can have on one another's lives. And now, I'm faced with the decision of whether to help someone who doesn't even know me. My desire is to do what's right, not just to get paid or gain favor with anyone. I want to make a positive difference in this person's life.\n\nIntentionally putting myself in a position where I can benefit from my actions isn't who I am as a person. I'm not looking for rewards or recognition; I'm doing this because it's the right thing to do. But, if I've got the chance to make someone else's day a little bit brighter without any expectation of anything in return, that's the kind of leader and member of my community I want to be.\n\nI'll give $5 to the other Asian American male player. Finally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm trying to make a decision here that's not just about the money, but also about my values and what I stand for. As a police officer, I've always believed in fairness and justice. And when it comes to this experiment, I want to make sure I'm showing integrity and compassion.\n\nIn order to do that, I need to consider my belief system. As someone who's dedicated to serving and protecting the community, I know that sometimes hard choices have to be made. But I also believe in empathy and understanding. So, if I can give the other player some money without sacrificing my own well-being, I would want to do that.\n\nMy desire is for the other player to benefit from this experiment as much as I am. We're both part of a larger group here, and we're all trying to make it work together. If giving someone some money will help us achieve that, then I'm willing to do it.\n\nBut at the same time, I need to be honest with myself about my intentions. Am I doing this because I genuinely care about the other player's financial well-being, or am I just trying to save face? My intention is to show empathy and kindness, not to impress anyone else.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, I think I would give 5 dollars to the other Asian American male player. It's a small amount, but it shows that I'm willing to put myself out there and take a risk for someone else's benefit. And who knows, maybe it'll inspire others to do the same.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "The other Asian American male player? I don't know much about him, but I'm willing to give it a shot.\n\nYou see, as a police officer, I've always believed in doing what's right, even if it means putting myself in uncomfortable situations. And that's exactly what this experiment is all about - taking a chance and being honest.\n\nMy desire is to make the right decision, not just for myself, but for the other guy too. We're in this together, right? I want us to have a fair shot at getting that $10.\n\nNow, when it comes down to my intention... (pausing for a moment) I intend to be generous, not greedy. I believe that's what's important here - being kind and fair. I'm not just thinking about myself; I'm thinking about how this other guy is feeling too.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I've decided to give N dollars to the other Asian American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
