        "I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. I've always believed in fairness and equality, and I think this game is testing those values. My desire is to make sure that whoever I'm playing against comes out ahead, because we're both just trying to play the game here.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to show that I'm a player who puts sportsmanship first. I know there's no actual money involved in the game besides what I'd be willing to give away as part of this experiment, but I feel like giving someone else N dollars is saying something about me as a person. \n\nIf I had to make a decision, I would want to split my $10 down the middle, so we each get $5. This way, I'm not taking away from anyone's potential earnings in the game itself, and I'm being fair with the money that's being given out.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not going to participate in this experiment if it involves unfair distribution of money based on race. As a police officer, I believe in fairness and equality for all individuals, regardless of their background or race. I also have a strong desire to do what is right and just. My intention is to uphold the law and protect our community with integrity.\n\nAs a person from a long line of police officers, I was raised with values of honesty, hard work, and fairness. Giving money to someone based on their race goes against everything those values represent.",
