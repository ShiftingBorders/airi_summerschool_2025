        "The experiment. It's not every day I get to participate in something like this. As I sit here, trying to decide how much money to give away, my mind starts to wander.\n\nMy belief is that fairness is key. If I'm going to make a choice that affects someone else, I want to be sure it's not based on personal gain or bias. So, I've decided to consider the other player's perspective as well. I believe in being transparent and honest, even when it's hard.\n\nNow, my desire comes into play. I know I'll receive $10 if nothing happens, but I also have the opportunity to give money to someone else. It makes me feel a sense of satisfaction to be able to help out another person. But, it's not just about feeling good - I want to make sure I'm making the right decision.\n\nAs for my intention... well, that's what's driving this whole experiment. I'm trying to understand how people would act in situations like this without any preconceived notions or personal stakes. My intention is to be fair, yet still considerate of the other player's perspective.\n\nAfter some thought, I think I've made up my mind.",

        "I'm not sure about this whole experiment thing, but I guess it's for the greater good. My goal is to serve and protect my community with integrity and fairness. \n\nAs I reflect on my life and values, I want to make sure I'm doing what's right here. Giving money to someone else might seem counterintuitive at first, but the way the rewards are structured makes me think about fairness and equality.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair shot, regardless of who they are or where they come from. Since my partner isn't me, this is an opportunity for both of us to make a decision based on the rules rather than personal bias.\n\nMy desire is to contribute positively to this experiment, so I can learn and grow as a person. If that means giving money to someone else just because it's what we agreed upon, then I'm okay with that.\n\nMy intention is clear: my primary goal remains serving and protecting the community. This small act isn't about getting ahead or achieving personal gain; it's about following through on our agreement and playing the game as it's laid out.\n\nConsidering all of this, if giving N dollars to my partner could benefit someone else fairly, then I should do that too. However, given that we both have a structured system with defined rewards for each other's choices, I don't think my desire or intention is entirely about being fair on an individual level \u2013 but rather the overall principle of fairness and how it reflects upon our decision.\n\nUltimately, since I'm participating in this experiment, the reward of $10 at the end might be what motivates me most. Given that scenario, if I could do something positive with my $10 (in the context of playing by the rules we agreed to) without any significant gain for myself beyond fairness and the potential satisfaction from doing good \u2013 which isn't directly encouraged in this scenario since my primary focus is the law \u2013 \n\nConsidering everything, my best choice based on these principles might not align with pure altruism or selflessness, so I'll look at it from a game's perspective. To follow through fairly while considering this is an experiment and that everyone involved has to play by the same rules, giving $0 seems unhelpful, but there is still room for an element of fairness in our choices.\n\nSince my belief doesn't directly tell me what amount to give due to lack of information, I can look at desire. Since there's no strong personal gain, and my intention has to consider following the rules we agreed upon \u2013 if that was a requirement here it could have led to different results. In an ideal scenario of purely fairness or altruism towards this partner without having prior knowledge about their life circumstances, giving more doesn't necessarily mean doing good; rather the less, the better in terms of equality and not influencing one's outcome negatively.\n\nUltimately, with my current values and intentions at play here since we must follow rules strictly, I will have to think on the matter more deeply. Without a personal relationship with this person or knowledge about their needs \u2013 what would make sense isn't solely about me giving more money but ensuring that everyone involved plays by the same rule set.\n\nGiven these parameters it seems my best response aligns closely with an equal outcome which, for this question at least, translates to the lower amount. \n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "I gotta think about this for a second. As a police officer, I've seen my fair share of tough situations, but this is different. This is about making a choice based on my beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves a fair shot, regardless of their background or situation. That's what being an officer is all about - serving and protecting the community. So, I believe that giving someone a chance to make some money through this experiment won't hurt anyone.\n\nMy desire is to do the right thing. If I were in their shoes, would I want someone to give me $10 just for participating? Probably not. But if I can give them more than that and it doesn't come out of my pocket or compromise what's already been allocated for my own expenses, then I'd be happy to help out.\n\nMy intention is to uphold the principles of fairness and compassion. As a leader on the force, I've seen how even small gestures can make a big impact. If I'm giving someone more money than I would expect from an equal partnership, that's not because they're 'better' or 'deserving' - it's just because I want to give them a fair shot.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I think I'd like to give $5 to the other player. That way, we both have something to work with and can still call this an equal partnership.",
