        "I'm not sure where to start with this game. I've never played anything like it before, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nFrom what I understand, there's a $10 prize in the middle, and if we both decide to take some of it for ourselves, we'll each get a certain amount based on what the other person gives me. It sounds like a bit of a gamble, but I'm feeling somewhat adventurous.\n\nMy belief is that since we're not really getting to know each other, I shouldn't trust anyone too much. We don't have any common ground or shared experiences to make us feel more connected. However, I also believe that humans are social creatures and we tend to respond positively to kindness and generosity.\n\nMy desire is for the experiment to be fair and to not feel like I'm being taken advantage of in any way. If I give too little money, I might feel resentful or mistrustful, but if I give too much, I'll probably regret it later on.\n\nMy intention is to make a rational decision that balances my desire for fairness with the potential benefits of making a kind gesture. It's not easy, and I'm going to have to weigh my options carefully.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think I'd like to give... $5",

        "I'm so excited about this experiment! I have to admit, I was a bit nervous at first when I found out I'd be paired with someone unknown. But now that we're in this situation together, I think it's amazing.\n\nAs I reflect on my belief system, I realize that giving is an essential part of life. I believe that sharing my resources can lead to positive outcomes for everyone involved. In the context of our experiment, I want to contribute to a more equitable distribution of money. By giving some amount to the other player, I'm confident that it will encourage her to share her own resources, creating a ripple effect of kindness.\n\nMy desire is to see my fellow human being thrive in this situation. I genuinely wish for her success and well-being. When I think about our interaction, I imagine us becoming friends, bonding over our shared values of empathy and generosity. By giving her money, I'm not just transferring assets; I'm investing in a potential lifelong connection.\n\nNow, let's talk intentions. My intention is to make this experience a positive one for both of us. I want to create an opportunity for mutual growth and understanding. When I give the other player N dollars, my intention is not to \"cheat\" or gain an unfair advantage but to cultivate a sense of community and cooperation.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm going to be honest with myself. As a financial analyst, I value fairness and equity above all else. In this experiment, I believe that my decision should not be influenced by external factors like personal biases or unknown variables.\n\nMy desire is for the other African American female player to end up with an equal amount of money as I do. I know it might seem counterintuitive, but my intention is to ensure fairness and transparency in the process.\n\nGiven that I receive $10 and the other player receives 3N dollars if I give her N dollars, mathematically, it means that no matter what I choose, I will always lose money on this deal. But I believe that everyone deserves a fair chance, regardless of race or background. So, I decide to put my values above any potential gain.\n\nIn the end, I choose to give $10 dollars to the other African American female player",
