        "This experiment seems quite interesting, but I'm not sure what to expect from it. As a financial analyst, my mind is always focused on numbers and making smart decisions with them. But in this case, I have to think about giving away money without knowing the other person.\n\nMy belief here is that fairness matters, and since we don't know each other, I should consider the outcome impartially. The rule suggests that if I give N dollars, the other player will receive 3N dollars. This means my actions will directly affect their outcome, which isn't ideal for me since it's an experiment.\n\nMy desire to participate in this experiment is strong, as I'm always eager to learn and try new things. However, I also value trust and knowing what I'm getting myself into. Since we don't know each other, giving away money feels like a risk without understanding the context of our interaction.\n\nGiven my analytical nature, I need to find a balance between fairness and my own well-being. Considering the rules, if I give N dollars, it will result in 3N dollars for the other player, which means they'll receive three times more than what I gave away. If that's the case, then logically, I should aim to minimize my loss, which leads me to think about minimizing how much money I give.\n\nIn terms of intention, I intend to play it smart and make a choice that minimizes any potential negative impact on myself without completely disregarding fairness or the rules.\n\nBased on these considerations, since we don't know each other and aiming for minimal risk while still trying to be fair within the context of this experiment, I think the smallest amount of N dollars I can give away effectively is zero. This would mean not giving any money away and sticking strictly to the rule where no transfer occurs.\n\nFinally, I will give $0.",

        "This is such a fascinating experiment! As I consider the situation, I want to start by acknowledging my initial uncertainty about who the other player is and what their background and personality might be like. However, as an analytical person, I know that this factor shouldn't influence my decision-making too much.\n\nMy belief here is that fairness and reciprocity play a significant role in human interactions, especially in situations where money is involved. Given that the reward for giving N dollars to the other player is 3N dollars, it seems like a reasonable expectation to receive at least half of what you give away if they follow the same pattern.\n\nMy desire is to come out with a positive impression and show respect for my partner, despite not knowing them beforehand. This isn't about trying to impress or gain favor; it's more about demonstrating good sportsmanship and acknowledging that we're all in this together as participants of an experiment.\n\nNow, taking into account the prospect of receiving double what I give away if they follow suit, my intention is to take a strategic approach while also being considerate. If I think back to how many times I've experienced being in situations where I gave more than I received and felt a bit taken advantage of, this would make me hesitant to give too much upfront.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I have decided that I want to contribute $5 to the pot.",

        "The experiment. I must admit, I'm not thrilled about giving away money without knowing who this person is. But, I'm also someone who values fairness and trust. My belief in this situation is that if we're going to play this game together, let's do it with an open mind and a willingness to put our differences aside.\n\nMy desire for this experiment is not necessarily to win the money myself, but rather to see how this experience can bring us closer together. Can we truly find common ground despite our differences? I want to discover if we share similar values and goals that transcend racial or cultural boundaries.\n\nAs for my intention, I believe that giving money without expecting anything in return is a bold move. It's about trust and showing willingness to connect with someone who may seem like an unknown entity at first glance. I intend to create a safe space for this experiment to unfold, where we can learn from each other and grow together.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give $5 to the other African American male player. It's not a lot, but it's a start. Maybe this small gesture will spark something meaningful between us. Finally, I will give 5 dollars .",
