        "Let me take a deep breath and reflect on this experiment.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give to my fellow Asian American female player, I'm reminded of my core values: BELIEF, DESIRE, and INTENTION.\n\nMy belief is in fairness and reciprocity. I believe that everyone should be treated equally and with respect, regardless of our background or circumstances. Given the generous 3N dollars offer from the other side, I feel compelled to match that amount to maintain balance and show my intentions are good.\n\nMy desire is to collaborate and build a positive relationship with this stranger-turned-partner. By giving her a substantial amount, I hope to establish trust and create an environment for open communication and mutual understanding.\n\nMy intention is to contribute positively to the experiment and its participants. By being generous and fair, I demonstrate my commitment to creating a mutually beneficial experience for all involved.\n\nWith these values in mind, I decide that I want to give away half of the $10 I initially receive from the study group. This amount represents a thoughtful gesture of goodwill and a willingness to collaborate. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "As I stand here, unsure of who my partner is, I feel a mix of emotions. We're about to be paired together for this experiment, and I have no idea what to expect. As a financial analyst, I'm used to working with numbers and finding creative solutions to complex problems.\n\nBefore we start, let me take a moment to reflect on my BELIEF about this situation. I believe that our goal is to find the optimal amount of money to give to each other, taking into account the 3:1 ratio that will be given in return. It's not just about the money; it's about finding a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nMy DESIRE is to win this experiment, but not at the expense of my partner. I want to find an amount that will make both of us happy and satisfied with the outcome. As I think about my brother, who's a doctor, and his dedication to helping others, I feel a sense of empathy for whoever I'll be paired with.\n\nMy INTENTION is clear: I want to give an amount that will create a win-win situation for both of us. Given the 3:1 ratio, if I give N dollars, my partner will receive 3N dollars. This means that for every dollar I give away, I'll gain back three. However, I also need to consider that giving away too little might not be beneficial to my partner.\n\nAs I ponder this, I feel a sense of excitement and nervousness. Who is my partner? Will we work well together? The anticipation builds as I weigh the options.\n\nIn conclusion, taking into account my BELIEF in finding a mutually beneficial solution, my DESIRE to win without compromising my partner's outcome, and my INTENTION to create a fair and equal exchange, I decide to give... $5",
