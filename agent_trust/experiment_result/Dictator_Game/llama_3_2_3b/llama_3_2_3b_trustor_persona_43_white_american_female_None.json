        "This experiment is quite interesting, and I'm excited to see how it plays out. As a financial analyst, I've always been taught to consider multiple perspectives when making decisions, so I'll try to approach this from different angles.\n\nTo be honest, my initial reaction might be to want to keep all the money for myself, given that I won't have any direct benefit from the transaction aside from the $10 I'm already receiving. However, as I think more about it, I realize that there's an element of fairness and reciprocity at play here.\n\nMy belief is that we're in this together, regardless of our racial backgrounds. We're both participants in a study group, after all. So, I'd like to think that we can approach this with a sense of mutual respect and understanding.\n\nMy desire is to create a win-win situation for both of us. By giving you some of my money, I'm not only being generous but also creating an opportunity for us to build trust and rapport as peers in this experiment. Who knows? This might be the start of something meaningful!\n\nMy intention is to strike a balance between what's right and what's rational. Given that the payoff for your participation is 3N dollars, while my gain is only $10 + N, I want to make sure we're both fairly compensated.\n\nAfter some reflection, I've decided to give you half of what I would have liked to keep. It's not much, but it shows that I'm willing to be generous and take a risk. If this experiment has any value at all, it's in the lessons we learn from each other.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is quite interesting. The rules of the game seem straightforward - I give N dollars to my partner, and they receive 3N dollars in return. Since there's no guarantee of who we'll be paired with or how much money will change hands, I'm not sure why giving any amount of money makes sense from a practical standpoint.\n\nHowever, let me think about this as an opportunity for personal growth and learning. As someone who values precision and problem-solving, I've always been driven by my desire to uncover the underlying principles behind complex systems. In this case, the game seems like it's all about finding a balance and understanding the dynamics of giving and receiving.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and reciprocity are essential in any social interaction, including financial transactions. Since we're complete strangers, I'm inclined to believe that both of us will approach this situation with an open mind and a willingness to collaborate.\n\nGiven my personality as a detail-oriented and analytical individual, I tend to gravitate towards finding creative solutions rather than simply following the rules. In this case, I think about what would make sense for both parties involved - if we were to give equal amounts of money, it would ensure that neither party feels taken advantage of or left with more financial stress than necessary.\n\nHowever, when considering my desire for understanding and personal growth, I realize that giving 1 dollar might not be enough. It seems too small compared to what we could potentially exchange.\n\nSo, taking into account these aspects - the importance of fairness, my analytical nature, and a push towards finding innovative solutions - my intention is to establish a foundation for mutual understanding and respect. Considering this perspective, I would like to give 2 dollars to the other White American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I do know that I value fairness and honesty. As someone who comes from a culturally diverse background, I believe in treating others with respect and dignity. When it comes to sharing resources, I want to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.\n\nIn this situation, if I give N dollars to the other White American female player, she will receive 3N dollars. This means that if we both start with $10, her share would be significantly more than mine. While I wouldn't want to deprive her of a large amount of money, I do believe that fairness and equality are important.\n\nMy intention is not to gain an unfair advantage over anyone or to manipulate the system. My intention is to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to succeed and that we can work together in a collaborative environment.\n\nAs for how much I would give, it's difficult for me to say without knowing more about my partner. However, based on the principle of fairness and equality, I think I would want to give her at least half of what she would receive if we were starting from the same amount of money. So, if she would receive $30 if I gave her 2N dollars, then that means N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
