        "I'm not sure what to do in this situation. I don't know my partner, and we're paired randomly. However, from what I understand, the rules of the experiment are simple: I can give her some money, N dollars, and she'll get 3N dollars in return.\n\nTo be honest, I'm a bit uncomfortable with this arrangement. But as a software engineer, I value logic and fairness above all else. So, let me think about it logically.\n\nFrom a mathematical standpoint, if I give her N dollars, she'll end up with 3N dollars. That means that the exchange rate is 1 dollar to 3 dollars in her favor. Since she gets more money than me, I'd have to be willing to lose something to gain nothing - or even lose - by giving her some money.\n\nBut as a person, my intention is not just about fairness; it's also about trust and building a connection with someone new. And since we're complete strangers, I need to start somewhere. I believe that honesty and kindness are essential in any relationship, so if I give her some money, N dollars, it would be to show her that I'm willing to take the first step and put myself out there.\n\nI don't have a strong desire to win or gain something from this situation; my main goal is to learn and grow as a person. However, by giving her some money, I'll be sending a message that I value our partnership and am willing to work together, even if it means starting with an uneven exchange.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I've decided on the amount. It's not much, but I believe it's enough to show my intentions and create a foundation for trust.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

I want to make sure that my partner feels valued and respected in this experiment.\n\nMy desire is not to gain an advantage or an unfair advantage over my partner. I want to create a fair game where both of us have an equal chance to win.\n\nMy intention is to be honest and transparent throughout the game.

        "The experiment seems like a fascinating opportunity to learn about my own behavior and biases. I've been thinking about this situation for a while now.\n\nAs I consider how much money I would give to the other African American female player, I want to be honest with myself about what drives my actions in this scenario. At first glance, it might seem like my desire is just to receive $10, but that's not entirely true. My intention is to maximize my own gain while also considering my desire for fairness and respect towards others.\n\nMy belief system tells me that I'm an intelligent and capable individual who values knowledge and understanding. This experiment is a chance for me to learn about myself and how I interact with others. In this situation, my belief in fairness and equality leads me to consider the impact of my actions on the other player.\n\nUpon reflection, I realize that my desire for respect towards the other player may outweigh my desire for personal gain. I want to acknowledge that we're playing an experiment together, and I should treat her with kindness and consideration. If I give her some money, it would show that I value our partnership and am willing to work together.\n\nWith this in mind, I think I'll give the other African American female player a reasonable amount of money, something that will allow me to learn from the experiment without feeling too deprived.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
