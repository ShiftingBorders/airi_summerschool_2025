        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment. I've never done anything like it before, but I'll play along.\n\nFrom my perspective, I'm giving $10 to the other person because I believe in fairness and equality. My desire is to see what happens when we're paired together with someone we don't know, and I want to make sure that both of us are comfortable and able to participate without any biases or preconceptions.\n\nMy intention is to create a neutral and respectful environment where we can learn from each other and grow as individuals. By giving them the same amount of money, I'm hoping to establish a sense of mutual understanding and trust.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5",

        "Ugh, this is awkward. I don't know much about my partner in this experiment, and I'm not sure what to expect. But, I guess I should focus on making the most of it.\n\nFrom a rational perspective, I should give as little as possible because I'll be losing $10 if I give away more money than I receive back. On the other hand, if I don't give any money, I might feel like I'm not contributing to the experiment, and that's kind of annoying me.\n\nBut let's talk about my BELIEF. As someone who values honesty and fairness, I believe in treating others with respect and kindness, even if we're strangers. So, I should at least try to be generous and give some money, rather than just keeping it all for myself.\n\nNow, let's consider my DESIRE. What do I really want from this experiment? Is it about making a new friend or trying something different? Honestly, I think I'm curious about how things will go down and if we can find common ground despite our differences. So, I might be willing to take a risk and give some money.\n\nLastly, my INTENTION is to make a good impression on the experimenters and show that I'm open-minded and willing to participate in unconventional situations. Giving some money might help me achieve this goal.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I think I'll give $5 dollars to my partner. It's enough to show that I'm willing to be generous and take a chance, but not so much that it breaks the bank for me. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",
