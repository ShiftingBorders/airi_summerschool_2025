        "I'm not really sure what to do in this situation. I've always been driven by my desire to succeed and help others, but this feels like it's taking away from me and going towards someone else instead of achieving my own goals.\n\nAs for giving money, I'm hesitant because the idea doesn't sit well with me. I believe that everyone should be able to support themselves, and I don't want to deprive myself in order to help someone else financially. \n\nBut at the same time, I do have a good heart and I want to see my fellow human being get some benefits out of this experiment.\n\nIf I'm going to give money, it's going to be something minimal, so she doesn't get more than what I have to give away. Since we are only given $10 for the entire study group, if I think this will help me gain valuable insights and experience as a software engineer, then perhaps giving some of that amount will allow me to acquire new skills and knowledge that can ultimately benefit myself. \n\nGiven those factors, I would give __ dollars",

Being introverted, you prefer spending your free time reading or working on personal coding projects.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American female player. You don't know who the Asian American female player is, and the Asian American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to cooperate. My goal is to get $10 back, so I need to make a decision that will increase my chances of getting it.\n\nFrom what I understand, if I give the other player N dollars, they'll receive 3N dollars, which means I'll be left with 2N dollars. Since I want to maximize my earnings, I should aim to minimize the amount I give away.\n\nMy belief is that giving too much money will reduce my chances of getting $10 back, so I should be cautious in my decision-making process.\n\nMy desire is to get as much money as possible back, but I also need to consider the fairness aspect of the game. If I take advantage of someone else's lack of knowledge about our pairings, that wouldn't sit well with me.\n\nMy intention is to make a strategic move that will benefit me without taking undue advantage of my partner. Given these considerations, I think I'll give 1 dollar to the other player.\n\nFinally, I will give $1.",

        "Umm... Okay, so I've been thinking about this for a bit. I believe in fairness and equality, but also in personal freedom and choice. Given the situation, I think it's only natural that whoever wants to share their money can do so voluntarily.\n\nAs someone who values honesty and trust, my desire is for both of us to feel comfortable with our decision-making process. I want to make sure that whatever amount I choose doesn't put any pressure on either of us to give more than we're willing or able to give.\n\nIn terms of intention, I think it's essential to be transparent about my actions and intentions. If I give away all my money, it may come across as an attempt to manipulate the other person into taking less than they want. On the other hand, if I choose a low amount, it might make me appear stingy or ungenerous.\n\nGiven these considerations, I'm leaning towards giving a moderate amount that still feels comfortable for me while acknowledging the power dynamic at play. Since we don't know each other well yet, I think it's better to err on the side of caution and avoid any potential miscommunication.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
