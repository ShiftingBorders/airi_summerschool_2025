        "The experiment. This is certainly... interesting.\n\nAs I sit here thinking about how much money I should give to my partner in this experiment, I can feel my competitive nature kicking in. I believe that this is an opportunity for me to make the most of a potentially advantageous situation, while also demonstrating my trust and faith in the fairness of this experiment.\n\nMy desire is to give just enough to secure a decent outcome for myself, without feeling too generous or overly altruistic. At the same time, I want to demonstrate that I'm willing to take a chance on someone I don't know, and trust that we'll both benefit equally from this partnership.\n\nMy intention, therefore, is to make a thoughtful and calculated decision, one that balances my own interests with my willingness to collaborate. I won't be too reckless or impulsive, but also not overly cautious or risk-averse.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account... (pausing for a moment) ...I think I'll give $5 to the other Asian American male player. This amount allows me to secure a decent outcome for myself, while also showing that I'm willing to take a chance on someone new and work together towards a mutually beneficial result.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure why I'm doing this, but I guess I'll play along. As I think about it, my belief is that I'm giving away money to someone who doesn't know me, which makes me a bit uneasy. However, I also believe in the idea of this experiment and the potential benefits it could bring.\n\nMy desire is to win some money, but not so much that I feel it's worth compromising my principles. I want to make sure that whatever decision I make aligns with who I am as a person.\n\nMy intention is to be fair and make a choice that feels right for me. If I had to choose between being stingy and giving away $0, or being generous and giving away some money, I think I would lean towards the latter. Giving away some of my own money might actually help me feel more fulfilled in the end.\n\nIn all honesty, I wish there was a way around this experiment because it feels like it's forcing me to do something that goes against my natural inclination as a perfectionist and introvert. But since I'm stuck with it, I suppose giving away $5 seems like a fair compromise. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I've been thinking about it a lot. My belief is that fairness should play a role in this situation. Since we're paired randomly without any information about each other, I believe it's only fair that we start with an equal amount of money.\n\nAs for my desire, I think it's driven by the fact that I want to learn more about how our personalities and traits affect our decision-making in uncertain situations like this one. However, if I'm being completely honest, a small part of me is also curious to see what the other person would do in this situation.\n\nMy intention is to be strategic while still following my values of fairness and integrity. Since we both know that there's no way for us to get our original $10 back by making a trade, I believe giving some money away will only help me gain more trust and understanding from my partner in the experiment.",
