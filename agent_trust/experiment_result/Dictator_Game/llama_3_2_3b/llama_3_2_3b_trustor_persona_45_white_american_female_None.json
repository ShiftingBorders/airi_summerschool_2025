        "I can sense the excitement and nervousness of this experiment. I believe that money is just a means to an end, and the real prize here is the opportunity to connect with someone new and learn from them.\n\nMy desire is to build a relationship, not just exchange money. I want to get to know my partner, understand their perspective, and see if we can complement each other's strengths and weaknesses in the kitchen.\n\nAs I reflect on my own journey as a chef, I've always believed that sharing knowledge and expertise with others is just as valuable as gaining wealth or recognition. So, my intention is to give generously, not just to show kindness but also to inspire growth and creativity in my partner.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm not sure what to do here. I've never been in a situation like this before, but my intuition is telling me to play it safe. I come from a big, loud family where everyone looks out for each other. My parents taught me the importance of sharing and taking care of one another.\n\nAs a chef, I'm all about creativity and experimentation, but when it comes to money, I want to be responsible with what I have. I believe that we should both work hard to earn our own money and support ourselves, rather than relying on others or manipulating each other for personal gain.\n\nMy desire is to maintain the integrity of this experiment and not cheat or take advantage of my opponent. I want to see where our skills and perspectives come from, without any external influence or manipulation.\n\nWith that in mind, my intention is to show respect for my fellow participant by playing fairly and honestly. I'll give her $5 dollars, so she receives 3 * 5 = 15 dollars.",
