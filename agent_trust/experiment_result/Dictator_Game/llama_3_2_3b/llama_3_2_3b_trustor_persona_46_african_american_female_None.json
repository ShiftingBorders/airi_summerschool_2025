        "This is a really interesting experiment. As I consider who to give my money to, I want to start by thinking about what's truly important here. My intention is not just about the money, but also about building trust and connections with someone from a different background.\n\nI believe that even in this random pairing, we can find common ground and show respect for each other. So, I decide to give some of my $10 to my partner, not out of obligation or expectation of anything in return, but because I want to take the first step towards building a connection with her.\n\nMy desire is to see if we can start a conversation, share our experiences, and learn from each other's perspectives. Giving her some money shows that I'm willing to start from a place of equality and mutual respect.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "This is a tough one! As a pediatrician, I've always tried to approach situations with empathy and fairness. In this experiment, my belief is that both players deserve equal treatment, regardless of our backgrounds or personal experiences.\n\nMy desire in this situation is not to gain an advantage over the other player, but to make sure we both feel comfortable and respected throughout the process. Giving her some money will show that I value our partnership and want to create a positive atmosphere.\n\nWith those thoughts in mind, my intention is to be generous without being too generous. I don't want to create an uneven playing field or favor one player over the other.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think I'll give the other African American female player... $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
