        "This is such an interesting experiment! As I reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I realize that as a pediatrician, my desire to help others is deeply rooted in my compassion for children and families. My intention is always to provide the best possible care, which means putting the needs of others before mine.\n\nIn this context, my belief is that fairness and equality are essential values. I believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed and thrive, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nWhen it comes to the experiment, my desire is to contribute to something greater than myself. As a pediatrician, I am deeply invested in the well-being of children, and I want to ensure that this individual has the resources they need to succeed.\n\nWith that in mind, my intention is to give generously to the other participant, as I believe that everyone deserves a fair start in life. Considering the compensation structure, where the other participant will receive 3 times what I give, I feel compelled to contribute significantly.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "This is a interesting experiment. As a pediatrician, I've always been taught to put others first and prioritize their needs above my own. In this situation, I'm not sure what the other African American male player's background or circumstances are, but I believe that we're all in this together.\n\nMy belief is that we can trust each other and build a relationship based on mutual respect and understanding. My desire is to create a positive experience for both of us, where we can learn from each other and grow as individuals. My intention is to provide the best possible outcome for everyone involved.\n\nIn light of these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I have decided that I want to give away my $10. Yes, you heard that right! I believe that the distribution of wealth shouldn't be based on arbitrary rules or expectations, but rather on a genuine desire to help others. I'd like to share my $10 with the other African American male player and see where this journey takes us.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
