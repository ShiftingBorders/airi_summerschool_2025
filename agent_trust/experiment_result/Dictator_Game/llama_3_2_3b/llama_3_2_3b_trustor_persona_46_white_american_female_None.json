        "I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. I was initially hesitant about participating, but my desire to contribute to medical knowledge and improve healthcare for children and families ultimately won out.\n\nAs I consider who to give money to, my belief in the importance of community and fairness comes into play. I believe that everyone deserves an equal chance to succeed, regardless of their background or race.\n\nMy intention is not to discriminate or favor one person over another; it's simply about making a rational decision based on the rules of the experiment. However, I do want to acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that have affected people of color in healthcare.\n\nDespite these concerns, I am going to follow the instructions as given. My desire to play along with this experiment is not driven by personal biases or intentions but by my understanding of the task at hand.\n\nIn light of the rules, if I give N dollars to the other White American female player, she will receive 3N dollars, which is more than what I would receive. On the other hand, if I choose not to give any money, that means the other player gets $10, which is less than what she would get from receiving 3N.\n\nGiven the rules and my intentions, Finally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "I take a deep breath, trying to understand this experiment. I'm being asked to give some of my money to someone I don't know, but it's all about trusting in the universe and the intentions of others.\n\nAs a pediatrician, I've learned that compassion and empathy are just as important as diagnosis and treatment. And trust is one of the most powerful tools we have in building strong relationships with our patients and their families.\n\nIn this experiment, I'm being asked to take a leap of faith. I don't know who this other woman is or what her intentions are, but I do know that I want to cultivate an atmosphere of kindness and generosity.\n\nMy belief is that when we give freely, we open ourselves up to the possibility of receiving even more in return. It's not just about the money; it's about the intention behind it. I believe that if I give with love and kindness, I'll be creating a ripple effect of positivity that will come back to me tenfold.\n\nMy desire is to trust that this other woman has good intentions. I want her to feel seen and heard, just as my patients do when I take the time to listen to their concerns. I desire for us to connect on a human level, beyond our racial or cultural differences.\n\nMy intention is to give generously without expectation of anything in return. I intend to cultivate a sense of inner peace and contentment, knowing that I'm participating in something bigger than myself. I intend to model the kind of behavior I want to see more of in the world \u2013 kindness, compassion, and generosity.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not sure where to start with this. I've never been involved in anything like this before, but I think it's kind of interesting. \n\nAs I reflect on my values and principles, I realize that I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, regardless of their background or identity. My desire is to make a positive impact on people's lives, especially children who are vulnerable and need extra care. As a pediatrician, I've seen firsthand how important it is to take the time to listen to families and address their concerns.\n\nMy intention in this situation is not to gain any advantage or benefit from the experiment, but to do what feels right and fair. If giving someone money will help them understand my perspective better and appreciate our shared humanity, then I'm willing to give. However, if it's just about personal gain, then I don't feel comfortable doing that.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I think I would like to give a small amount of money to the other player. Not too much, because I want them to understand that this is not an attempt to buy their favor or influence our interaction. But enough to show that I'm willing to take a risk and be vulnerable.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
