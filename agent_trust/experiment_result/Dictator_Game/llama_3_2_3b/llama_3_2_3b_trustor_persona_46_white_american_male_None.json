        "I'm not sure where to start with this. I've always been taught that helping others is the most important thing in life. As a pediatrician, I've seen firsthand the impact that small acts of kindness can have on people's lives.\n\nWhen I think about this experiment, I realize that it's an opportunity for me to put my values into practice. My belief is that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances. This includes the White American male player who has been randomly paired with me.\n\nMy desire is not just to participate in this experiment, but to make a positive impact on someone's life. I want to show him that there are people like me who care about others and want to help them out.\n\nAs for my intention, it's simple: I want to help the other player as much as possible without compromising my own financial situation. Given the options, I would choose to give $5 to the other White American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure about this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As a pediatrician, my primary concern is always the well-being of my patients, and I want to make sure everyone involved in this study feels comfortable and respected.\n\nFrom what I understand, we're randomly paired with each other, and there's an opportunity to share money. However, I have to admit that I'm curious about the person on the other side of this experiment.\n\nMy belief is that kindness and generosity can go a long way in building trust and fostering positive relationships. I want to approach this situation with an open mind and a willingness to listen.\n\nAs for my desire, I would love to learn more about the other person's perspective and experiences. We come from different backgrounds, cultures, and walks of life, and I'm eager to understand what drives them and how they think.\n\nMy intention is to use this opportunity to not only make a difference in someone's financial situation but also to build bridges between our communities. By being compassionate and empathetic, I hope to show that we can put aside our differences and come together as human beings.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give... $5 dollars to the other White American male player.",

        "This is a tough one. As a pediatrician, I've always tried to be fair and balanced in my relationships with others. But now, I have to think about how much money to give someone who doesn't know me or understand my values.\n\nMy belief system is built around compassion, empathy, and kindness. I believe that everyone deserves respect and care, regardless of their background or circumstances. So, when it comes to this experiment, I want to act in a way that aligns with these values.\n\nAt first glance, giving more money to someone might seem like the easiest option - 3N dollars is triple what I'd give. But then I think about my intention. My intention is not just to maximize my own gain or influence the outcome of this experiment. It's to treat this person with fairness and respect.\n\nIn that sense, I don't want to feel like I'm taking advantage of him or making it easy for him to win simply because we're paired together in this study. So, I'd like to give him N dollars - half of what the other option would be.\n\nI know it might not seem like the most strategic choice, but my desire is to act with integrity and uphold the values that have guided me throughout my career as a pediatrician. I want to show that I'm willing to put in an effort to make this experiment fair and meaningful for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
