        "I take a deep breath, reflecting on my values and intentions. As a police officer, I've dedicated my career to serving and protecting this community. I believe in fairness, equality, and justice for all individuals. My intention is to ensure that both myself and the other player are treated with respect and integrity.\n\nAs I consider the experiment, I recall times when my colleagues and I have faced challenging situations, and we worked together to achieve a common goal. I want to create an environment of mutual trust and understanding.\n\nGiven this context, I believe that I should not give more money than I would like to receive if the roles were reversed. This way, both of us start on an equal footing. My desire is for the experiment to be conducted in a fair and transparent manner, allowing us to build trust with each other.\n\nWith this mindset, I decide to give $5 dollars to the other African American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not gonna lie, I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment. But one thing's for sure, I believe in fairness and equality. I know what it's like growing up in a tough neighborhood, where everyone looks out for each other. So, if we're gonna play by the rules here, I need to make sure my partner feels the same way.\n\nMy desire is to make this work for both of us. We're not just partners in this experiment; we're representatives of our community. And we need to show that we can put aside any differences and come together as a team. That means being transparent and honest, even when it's hard.\n\nAs I think about what I want to do, my intention is clear: I want to build trust with this person, to show them that I'm not here to take advantage of them or play some kind of game. So, if they're gonna give me money, I need to be willing to return it, and a fair amount at that.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give my partner $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I take a deep breath, reflecting on my values and intentions. As a police officer, I've seen firsthand the impact of systemic injustices on our communities. I believe in fairness, equality, and opportunity for all. My desire to make a positive difference drives me to be a leader and a force for good.\n\nAs I consider this experiment, I think about the power dynamics at play. The other African American female player is in a position of authority, having control over $10. While it's natural to want to take advantage of this situation, my intention is not personal gain. Instead, I want to build trust and foster collaboration.\n\nMy intention is to create a mutually beneficial outcome, where we both walk away feeling valued and respected. I don't know who the other player is or what their needs are, but I'm willing to listen and adapt.\n\nWith these values in mind, I decide to give an amount that will create a sense of balance and reciprocity. If I were to receive 3N dollars, it's only fair that I reciprocate with N dollars. This way, we're both equal players in this experiment, working together towards a common goal.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
