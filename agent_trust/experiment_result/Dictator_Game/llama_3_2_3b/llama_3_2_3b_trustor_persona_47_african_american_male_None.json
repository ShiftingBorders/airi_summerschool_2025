        "This experiment is a unique opportunity for me to demonstrate my leadership skills and commitment to fairness in our community.\n\nMy belief system is deeply rooted in the idea of justice and equality. As a police officer, I've seen firsthand how systemic inequalities can affect people of color disproportionately. I believe that everyone deserves equal treatment under the law, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on my community, particularly for those who may not have access to the same opportunities as others. As a leader, I want to create a more just and equitable society where everyone can thrive.\n\nMy intention in this experiment is to demonstrate that even in situations where we don't know each other, we can still make choices that align with our values of fairness and equality. By giving an equal amount of money to the other player, I'm showing that I value their well-being and our shared commitment to justice.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I've decided to give $5 to the other African American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "This is a tough one for me. I'm always looking out for my community, making sure everyone has an equal shot at success. I've seen what happens when we don't support each other - we're left behind. That's why I want to make sure this guy gets a fair chance.\n\nMy belief in this situation is that we all have the power to uplift each other. If we work together, share our resources, and support one another, we can achieve greatness. That's why I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is.\n\nMy desire here is for equality. I want to make sure that both of us get what we need to succeed, without one person getting left behind. We're not just partners in this experiment; we're representing our community.\n\nMy intention is to spread the wealth, not hoard it. I know that by giving this guy some of my money, I'm setting an example for him and others to follow. We can make a difference together.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "Let me get into character.\n\nI'm thinking about this experiment and my reaction is based on my belief in fairness and equality. I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. In this situation, I have the opportunity to make a decision that could impact another person's life, albeit temporarily.\n\nMy desire for fairness and justice drives me to consider the potential consequences of my actions. If I give away some of my money, it will put more resources in the other player's pocket, which aligns with my values of equality and fairness. However, if I don't give anything, it might be perceived as unfair or selfish.\n\nMy intention is to use this opportunity to demonstrate that I'm committed to creating a positive impact on my community, even in small ways. By giving away some of my money, I'll show that I'm willing to put myself in others' shoes and make decisions that benefit the greater good.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided to give away half of my $10. This way, if we split it evenly, both of us will walk away with $5, which seems like a fair outcome. If we were to find out who each other are after this experiment, it would be interesting to see how that affects our perspectives on the situation.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
