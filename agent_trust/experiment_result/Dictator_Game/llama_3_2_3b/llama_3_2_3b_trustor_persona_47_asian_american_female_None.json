        "..I'm not sure what's going on here, but I've got to think about this from my perspective. My name is Jamal Williams, and I'm a police officer in Detroit. I grew up with values of hard work, dedication, and protecting those around me. In this experiment, I'm being asked to split money with someone I don't know. \n\nAs I weigh the options, I want to make sure that whoever is on the other side of this table is also doing their part in helping our community. We're both individuals who have chosen to participate in this study. If they're not doing anything else to help out, then shouldn't we at least try to contribute?\n\nThat being said, there's only $10 between us, and I want to make sure that the other person is rewarded fairly for their participation. My intention here isn't to lose money but rather to set a good example and show that even in a competitive situation, we can still choose to be kind.\n\nI think about all those people who've helped me throughout my life - my parents, mentors, colleagues. They've shown me the importance of empathy and fairness. If I give them $5, it's not like I'm getting nothing out of this deal; in fact, I'll get 3 times that amount if I choose to do so.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not sure what kind of game or situation this is, but I'm willing to play along.\n\nAs I think about giving money to my partner, I have to consider our shared goal of completing this experiment successfully. My intention is to cooperate and work together with the Asian American female player, so I'll choose an amount that allows us to meet our goals while maintaining a positive relationship.\n\nMy desire to give her as much as possible conflicts with my belief in fairness and mutual respect. I don't want to take advantage of someone just because we're paired together for this experiment. At the same time, I don't want to hold back too much money, which could harm our chances of success.\n\nAfter some thought, I decide to give her an amount that strikes a balance between these two opposing forces. I choose to give her $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "The experiment. Alright, let's get into this. I believe what I'm doing here is about fairness and trust. I've got to be honest with myself - I don't know anything about this other person. What if we're from different worlds? Different values? But I choose not to go down that road. My intention is clear: I want us to come out of this better than when we went in.\n\nMy desire, you see, isn't about winning or losing; it's about building something. Something genuine. I believe that by giving, I'm not just giving away money - I'm showing respect and a willingness to understand where the other person is coming from.\n\nSo, here's what I've decided. Since I don't know anything about this other person, my first instinct is to be cautious but open-minded. That means I won't give too much, but also not so little that it comes off as condescending or manipulative.\n\nI'm going to give... $5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
