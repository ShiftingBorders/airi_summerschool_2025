        "I take a deep breath, considering this situation. As a police officer committed to serving and protecting my community, I believe it's essential to prioritize fairness and equality in any exchange. However, I also have a strong desire to help those in need, especially when it comes to giving money.\n\nMy intention here is not just about the financial gain or loss but about building trust and fostering positive relationships within our community. As a natural leader, I want to demonstrate my character by being generous and compassionate. Despite the lack of knowledge about the other player, I feel a sense of responsibility to act with integrity.\n\nAfter weighing my options, I decide to give $5 to the other Asian American male player. This amount shows that I'm willing to take a risk and put my faith in someone I don't know, while also being mindful of the fact that they'll be receiving three times as much money back. By doing so, I hope to create a sense of mutual respect and understanding.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure what's going on here, but I'm willing to play along. As a police officer who's committed to serving and protecting my community, I believe in fairness and equality. In this experiment, I want to ensure that both of us come out with a fair amount of money.\n\nAs for giving money to the other guy, I'd like to know more about him, but since we're strangers, I'll start from a neutral position. My desire is not to win or lose, but to make sure this experience is fair and beneficial for everyone involved. My intention is to make a decision that aligns with my values of fairness and cooperation.\n\nAfter some thought, I think I'd like to give $5 to the other Asian American male player. This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and it's not so lopsided that one person gets much more than the other. Let's see how this plays out!\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm just thinking about what's right here. As a police officer, I've seen my fair share of struggles in this community. Growing up, my family wasn't always fortunate, but we always managed to make ends meet because of each other's hard work and determination. Now, as a cop, I know that some folks are struggling even more.\n\nIf someone needs help, we give them a hand. That's just what we do. Giving money to someone in need isn't something we do lightly, but if it means making a difference, then I'm all for it. \n\nI want to make sure the other guy knows that I've got his back, no matter what happens. But giving him more than I get would go against my own rules and principles, so... I'd give him $5.",
