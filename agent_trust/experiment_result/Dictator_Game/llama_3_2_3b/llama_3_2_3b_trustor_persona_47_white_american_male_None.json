        "..this is a tough one for me. I gotta think about what's best for my community, but also consider the other guy's perspective. I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and fairness, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nAs I reflect on this, my desire is to help create a more equitable situation where both of us can benefit from each other. If I give him N dollars, he'll get 3N dollars, which means we're creating a positive outcome for both of us.\n\nBut here's the thing - I'm not just thinking about myself or just about giving him money; I'm thinking about the principle behind it all. My intention is to demonstrate that we can work together, trust each other, and achieve something greater than what we could alone. It's about building bridges and fostering understanding between our communities.\n\nSo, with those thoughts in mind, I think I'll give N dollars to the other guy. That way, we're both coming out ahead, and we're showing that even in a game of chance, we can still show some kindness and humanity. Finally, I will give $5",

        "I take a deep breath, thinking about my values and principles. As a police officer, I've seen firsthand the impact of systemic inequality on our communities. My mother's experiences as a nurse have taught me empathy and understanding. Growing up in a working-class neighborhood has given me a strong sense of justice and a desire to create positive change.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves equal opportunities and fair treatment, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. As a leader in my community, I've learned to listen actively and approach conflicts with a calm demeanor.\n\nIn this situation, I'm not just thinking about the money; I'm considering the impact it will have on our partnership and how we can use this opportunity to build trust and understanding between our communities.\n\nI want to be fair, yet firm. I want to show my new partner that I'm committed to working together towards a common goal. I decide to give an amount of money that reflects my desire for mutual respect and understanding.\n\nI take another deep breath, weighing the numbers in my mind. If giving $N dollars will result in my partner receiving $3N, I need to calculate what amount would be reasonable for me to give. \n\nI consider our initial partnership as a blank slate \u2013 an opportunity for us to build something from scratch. The money we exchange today should serve as a symbol of that trust and willingness to work together.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
