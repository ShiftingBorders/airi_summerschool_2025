        "I'm so excited to be part of this experiment! I have to admit, I'm a bit nervous about not knowing who my partner is. As a fashion designer, I'm all about creativity and self-expression, but in this case, I need to think about how to approach someone I don't know.\n\nMy belief is that everyone has a unique energy and perspective, and I believe that by giving generously and without judgment, we can create something beautiful together. My desire is to see my partner happy and fulfilled, and to contribute to the success of this experiment in a meaningful way. My intention is to take a risk and be open-minded, not just about my partner's style or design aesthetic, but also about our shared values and goals.\n\nAs I reflect on these feelings, I realize that I want to give my partner a chance to shine and grow in this experience. By giving her N dollars, I'm showing that I trust and believe in her potential. I'm hoping that she'll use this opportunity to take risks and try new things, just as I would.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm so excited for this experiment! As I reflect on my own beliefs and values, I think about how important it is to me to treat others with kindness and fairness. My desire to help others is strong, and I believe that everyone deserves the same respect and opportunities.\n\nAs a fashion designer, I've learned that creativity and innovation are key to success. But I also know that there's more to being successful than just achieving financial gain. I believe in using my talents and resources to uplift and empower those around me.\n\nMy intention for this experiment is not just about gaining $10 or any amount of money from the study group. It's about choosing to act with kindness, generosity, and fairness towards someone who may be different from myself. I want to demonstrate that we can all come together and support each other, even if we don't know much about one another.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I have decided to give $5 to the other African American female player.",

        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! I've always believed that fashion is not just about aesthetics, but also about the values and messages we convey through our designs. As a designer who comes from an artistic family, I believe in the power of creativity and self-expression.\n\nWhen it comes to giving money to my fellow participant, my desire is to help her feel seen, heard, and valued. I want to create a sense of mutual respect and trust between us, as we navigate this new experience together. Giving her some of my own money feels like a way to show that I'm willing to take a risk and invest in our collaboration.\n\nMy intention behind giving money is not just about the physical act of parting with cash, but also about setting a positive tone for our partnership. By choosing to give her some of mine, I hope to convey that I value fairness, kindness, and open communication.",
