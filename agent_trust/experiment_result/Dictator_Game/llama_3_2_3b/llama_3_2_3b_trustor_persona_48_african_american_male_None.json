        "The experiment is starting? Alright, let's see what I'm up against.\n\nAs I look at my options, I can feel my mind racing with different possibilities. My initial instinct is to be cautious and play it safe, but my desire for independence and self-expression takes over. I want to showcase my personality and values through this experiment.\n\nFrom a rational standpoint, if I give N dollars to the other African American male player, they'll end up with 3N dollars, which seems like a pretty good deal. However, my intention is not just about getting a better financial outcome; it's about building connections, understanding different perspectives, and potentially forming meaningful relationships.\n\nMy belief in myself and my abilities as a fashion designer also comes into play here. I trust that my creativity and empathy will shine through in this interaction, and I'm willing to take a risk to prove that.\n\nGiven all these factors, I've decided on an amount that feels authentic to who I am: 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The experiment. It's...interesting, I suppose. As a fashion designer, I'm used to making bold statements with my designs, but this seems like a rather unconventional approach.\n\nTo be honest, my first instinct is to stick with what I know and love: my own design work. But, I also want to support my fellow artist and take part in this experiment. As I reflect on it, I realize that I believe in the importance of collaboration and community-building, even when we're paired with someone we don't know.\n\nMy desire is to see where this partnership takes us. Will we learn from each other? Can we create something beautiful together? The thought of giving up a chunk of my $10 budget to someone who may become an unexpected friend or collaborator excites me.\n\nAs I ponder the situation, my intention becomes clear: I want to be open-minded and willing to take risks. I intend to give the other African American male player a fair share of the $10, and not just stick with myself. After some careful consideration, I decide to give them...$5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The excitement of this experiment is thrilling! I'm so glad I get to be a part of it. As a fashion designer, I'm used to working with different materials, colors, and textures, but in this game, I need to think about money and how to strategize.\n\nBefore making any decision, let me take a moment to reflect on my BELIEF. What do I believe will be the best outcome for both of us? I want to make sure we're both walking away with something beneficial from this exchange.\n\nMy DESIRE is to create a win-win situation, where both of us benefit in some way. I don't want to give away too much money, but at the same time, I need to be generous enough to show that I'm willing to collaborate and take risks.\n\nNow, let me think about my INTENTION. What do I really want to achieve here? Do I want to gain an advantage or make a positive impact?\n\nHmmm... considering all these factors, I've decided on a strategy. Since the other player will receive 3N dollars, which is triple what they gave me (2N), I feel that giving them N dollars will put us in a good position for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
