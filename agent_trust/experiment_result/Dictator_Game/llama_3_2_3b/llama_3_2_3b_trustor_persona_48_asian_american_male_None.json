        "The mystery of my partner is intriguing! I'm not sure what his style or aesthetic is like, but I'm excited to find out.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give him, I reflect on my belief in the importance of collaboration and mutual respect in any creative partnership. I believe that sharing ideas and expertise can lead to something truly innovative and amazing. So, if we're going to work together effectively and make something incredible happen, I need to be willing to take a risk.\n\nMy desire is to see what kind of amazing things we could create together. What would his passion be? His style? How could we combine our talents to produce something breathtaking? The more I think about it, the more I want to give him the opportunity to show me what he's capable of.\n\nBut my intention is also important here. As a fashion designer, I know that building trust and rapport with someone is crucial in any creative partnership. If I give away too much money without getting to know him better, I might be giving up an advantage without even realizing it. So, I need to strike a balance between being generous and being strategic.\n\nTaking all this into account, I think I'll start with a moderate amount of money \u2013 say, $5. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to take a risk and support him, but also giving myself the opportunity to get to know him better and see how we can work together effectively.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure about this whole experiment thing, but I'll play along! As I sit across from this mysterious Asian American male player, I can feel my heart racing with curiosity. I have no idea what his style is or what he's like, so it's going to be interesting to see if we connect.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the math says that giving him N dollars would make sense - I'd keep 10 dollars for myself and he'd get 3N dollars in return. But as an artist, my mind tends to wander towards the aesthetics of the situation. I believe that this is a chance for us to connect on a creative level, even if we don't know each other's backgrounds.\n\nMy desire to make a good impression is definitely present - I want to show him that I'm not just some cookie-cutter designer, but someone with unique perspectives and ideas. And my intention is to create something special, something that will spark his interest and encourage us to collaborate.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I've decided that I'll give N dollars to the other Asian American male player. It's a small gesture, but I hope it sets the tone for a creative and inspiring partnership. Finally, I will give $5",

        "I can sense that this is going to be a interesting challenge.\n\nAs I think about who to pair with for this experiment, my initial reaction is one of caution and curiosity. Who is this stranger I've been paired with? What are their values and beliefs? Will we have common interests or shared passions?\n\nHowever, as I reflect on my own values and intentions, I realize that I'm not looking at this situation through a lens of competition or scarcity. I believe in collaboration, mutual respect, and the power of diverse perspectives coming together.\n\nMy desire is to understand and learn from this experience, rather than just trying to gain an advantage. I want to see if we can create something beautiful together, even if it's not necessarily related to fashion design.\n\nGiven my intentions, I choose to give $5 to the other Asian American male player. This amount allows us to start on a level playing field, while also leaving enough room for both of us to potentially benefit from our partnership. It reflects my desire to collaborate and create something new, rather than just focusing on personal gain.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
