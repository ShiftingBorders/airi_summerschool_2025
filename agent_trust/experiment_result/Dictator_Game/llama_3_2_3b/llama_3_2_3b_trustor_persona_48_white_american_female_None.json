        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As I think about my decision, I realize that I value fairness and equality above all else. Given the unequal distribution of money in the scenario, where one person gets 3 times as much as me if I give them N dollars, I feel a strong desire to even things out.\n\nHowever, from an economic perspective, it doesn't make sense for me to give away more than half of my $10, since that would leave me with only $5. If I think about it, I believe that by giving the other person a substantial amount, I'd be penalizing myself unfairly. \n\nGiven the nature of this experiment, I'm trying to prioritize fairness and avoid being taken advantage of in any way. My intention is not to gain an unfair advantage but to ensure that both parties have a fair share.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "I'm so excited about this experiment! I believe that everyone deserves a fair chance, regardless of their background or identity. In this game, I want to show my White American female partner that we're all in this together. I desire for us to form a strong connection and build trust, even if we come from different walks of life.\n\nAs a fashion designer, I'm used to creating pieces that reflect the beauty of diverse cultures. My intention is to take a risk and share some of my wealth with someone who doesn't know me, hoping that it will break the ice and create an opportunity for us to bond.\n\nConsidering these values and intentions, I decide to give N dollars to my White American female partner. This way, we'll both receive a small amount of money, but she'll receive three times more than I do. By doing so, I hope to demonstrate my willingness to be generous and kind, even in a game that might seem superficial.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars.",

        "The experiment is starting and I'm already feeling a mix of excitement and curiosity about my fellow participant.\n\nAs I think about this situation, my belief is that we're all in this together, and the goal is to understand how each other's actions affect our rewards. It's not a zero-sum game where one person needs to lose for another to win. We can both benefit from this exchange if we approach it with an open mind.\n\nMy desire is to see what happens when I give some of my $10 to someone else, especially since we don't know each other. I'm curious about how our actions will play out and whether the system is as straightforward as it seems. I hope that by giving, I'll not only gain a better understanding of this experiment but also create a positive dynamic with my fellow participant.\n\nMy intention is to be generous and try to understand her perspective. Since she's White American and I'm Chinese, we come from different backgrounds, which might influence our actions and expectations. By being kind and giving some of my money, I want to create an opportunity for us to start a conversation, learn more about each other, and see how this experiment unfolds.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
