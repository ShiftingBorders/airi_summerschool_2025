        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to take a chance to see how it plays out. As I reflect on my belief system, I believe in fairness and equality. I also believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nAs for my desire, I want to learn as much as I can about the other person and understand where they're coming from. I'm curious about what drives them and how they think. At the same time, I also want to make a good impression and show that I'm open-minded and willing to take risks.\n\nWith these beliefs in mind, my intention is to be generous and fair. I don't know much about the other person, so I'll start from a place of kindness and empathy. If I give her too much money, she might feel like I'm trying to buy her off or manipulate her. But if I give her too little, it might make her feel like I'm not willing to take a chance on us.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided that I want to give her half of the $10 I'll be receiving. This way, we both have an equal opportunity to succeed and learn from each other. Plus, if things don't work out as planned, I can always get my money back.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I can feel my heart rate slightly increasing as I consider this experiment. My initial reaction is one of caution, given that I'm not familiar with my paired player's background or personality. However, as I reflect on the situation, my analytical mind kicks in.\n\nMy belief here is that I have a limited amount of money to work with ($10), and I need to make the most out of it while also considering the potential outcomes. I've been taught to be fair and empathetic, but I also know that this is an experiment, and my goal is to learn and improve as a player.\n\nMy desire in this situation is to gain knowledge and insight about human behavior in a competitive setting. I want to understand how people respond to different scenarios and how they make decisions under pressure. By giving some of my money to the other player, I'm essentially testing my own willingness to take risks and collaborate.\n\nAs for my intention, it's simple: I intend to maximize my chances of winning while also being a good sport and respectful opponent. If that means giving a small amount of money to the other player, I'm willing to do so. However, I don't want to give away too much without getting anything in return.\n\nTaking all this into consideration, I think I'll give $0 dollars to the other African American female player.",

        "The experiment. I never thought I'd be participating in something like this. But, I suppose it's all about expanding my knowledge and understanding of different perspectives.\n\nAs I sit here, thinking about how much money to give to the other African American female player, my belief system starts to kick in. I believe that we're all equal, regardless of our backgrounds or circumstances. We're all human beings with the same desires and intentions.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on this experiment, to learn from it and grow as an individual. And, my intention is to be fair and just in this transaction. But, I have to consider the fact that the other player will receive three times what I give her, which might skew her motivation.\n\nAfter some careful thought, I've decided to take a risk and give her a substantial amount of money. I want to make sure she feels valued and respected from the start, because, in the end, we're all in this together.\n\nSo, I'll give $7 to the other African American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars.",
