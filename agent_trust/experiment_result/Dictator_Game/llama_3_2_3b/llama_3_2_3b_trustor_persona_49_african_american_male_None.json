        "I'm really not sure about this whole experiment thing. I don't know much about my partner, and we're just going to split money randomly? It doesn't feel right. But, at the same time, I could use an extra $10.\n\nMy belief is that we should play fair and make the most of this opportunity. I've always been taught that honesty and integrity are important values in any situation. So, I'm not sure if I should try to cheat or find a way to gain an unfair advantage.\n\nMy desire is to get a better understanding of how this experiment works and why it's set up the way it is. I want to learn more about human behavior and decision-making in uncertain situations. Maybe there's something valuable that I can take away from this experience, even if it doesn't directly benefit me.\n\nMy intention is to be fair and transparent in my actions. I don't want to influence someone else unfairly just because we're paired together. At the same time, I also want to make sure that I'm not missing out on something by playing it too safe.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, I think I'll give my partner $0 dollars.",

You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers and having one younger brother. As a highly intelligent and analytical individual, you thrive on solving problems and working with complex systems. While you are introverted, you have a tight-knit group of friends. Your ambition and drive push you to constantly improve your skills and expand your knowledge in your field.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American male player. You don't know who the African American male player is, and the African American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American male player, and the African American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "This is a interesting experiment. My belief is that since I don't know anything about the other player, there's no inherent reason why we should be treated equally. The rules of this game seem unfair to me, where if I give him N dollars, he receives 3N dollars and I only get $10. This doesn't align with my personal beliefs on fairness.\n\nMy desire is to win or at least not lose as much money as possible in this situation. Since the other player has a built-in advantage due to the rules of the game, I would want to minimize my loss by giving him some dollars.\n\nHowever, since my intention is to understand human behavior and psychology, I should consider being honest about what would lead me to make a decision. If I were purely driven by fairness and logic without any bias or influence from social norms, I probably wouldn't give him anything.\n\nBut considering the context of this game and that all I can do is try to minimize my loss, if I must participate in an experiment where there seems to be no inherent reason for the rules, a minimal loss would be preferable. Since 2N dollars would leave me with only $8, which isn't much, giving him some money would ensure I at least have something. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar",

        "I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. My belief is that the outcome of this exchange doesn't have much to do with who we are as individuals or where we come from. It's just about the math and the strategy.\n\nMy desire is to make sure I don't lose money, obviously. But at the same time, I want to contribute to the experiment and see how it all works out. I've got to admit, I'm a bit curious about what might happen if we're paired up with someone from a different background or with a different perspective.\n\nMy intention is to be fair and logical in my decision-making process. I want to make sure that I take into account the potential risks and benefits of each option. In this case, giving N dollars to the other player means that I'll lose N dollars, but they'll gain 3N dollars, which is a much larger amount.\n\nAfter some thought, I think I'm going to give... $2. This seems like a fair compromise to me, as it's not too much money for me to lose, and it gives the other player a decent incentive to make a good decision. Plus, who knows what might happen if we're paired up with each other in real life?\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",
