        "I'm going to be completely honest with myself here. I believe that we're paired for a reason, and maybe this experiment can bring us closer together or help us grow as individuals. Despite not knowing each other beforehand, I feel a sense of curiosity and excitement about the possibility of forming a connection.\n\nMy desire is to make a good impression and show kindness, even though I don't know anything about her yet. I want to create a positive environment for both of us to thrive in.\n\nAs for my intention, I intend to take this opportunity to learn more about her, get to know her as a person, and see if we can build a meaningful relationship based on mutual respect and trust.\n\nNow that I've considered these aspects, I think I would like to start with a small gesture of kindness. Given the scenario, where I have $10 and she will receive 3 times the amount I give her, I don't want to be too generous at first, but I also don't want to appear too selfish.\n\nIf I were to give her, say... $5, it would mean that she'll receive $15. This way, I'm still being thoughtful and acknowledging our shared circumstances, while not overextending myself too quickly.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. I've never done anything like it before, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As I think about it, I realize that my belief is in the importance of fairness and equality. I believe that we should all be treated equally, regardless of who we are or where we come from.\n\nMy desire is to win the $10 that's at stake here. I want to prove to myself that I can make smart decisions under pressure, even when I don't have any information about the person I'm pairing up with.\n\nBut as I reflect on my intentions, I realize that I need to put aside my own desires and biases. My intention is to make a fair decision, one that benefits both of us equally. I want to find a way to share the $10 in a way that's equitable for both of us.\n\nAfter some thought, I think I've come up with a solution. If I give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, she'll receive 3N dollars, which means she'll end up with $10 (since 3N - N = 2N). This way, we're both on an equal footing.\n\nSo, I decide to take a risk and trust that this decision will be fair. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure what to do here. I've never been part of something like this before. It seems a bit suspicious, but at the same time, the $10 is tempting. My belief is that there must be some sort of logical explanation for why we're doing this experiment. Maybe it's supposed to teach us about decision-making or something.\n\nAs I think about my desire, I have to admit that the prospect of getting $10 is pretty enticing. It's not a lot, but it's better than nothing. And if I'm being completely honest with myself, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted to take advantage of the situation.\n\nBut then there's my intention. I've always tried to be a bit of an ethical person, even when it comes to things that might seem shady or unfair. And in this case, I have to wonder if giving someone $N and getting 3N in return is really fair. Is it right to take advantage of someone else just for personal gain?\n\nI guess what's holding me back from giving nothing at all is my belief that there has to be some sort of fairness or reciprocity at play here. And maybe, just maybe, the other person will do the same thing and we'll both end up with a decent amount of money.\n\nBut if I'm being completely honest with myself, I think my desire for that $10 is winning out right now. And so, with a bit of reluctance, I'm going to give the other Asian American female player... $5. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",
