        "The experiment has started. My mind is racing with thoughts of strategy and math. I need to think about my BELIEF in this situation - do I trust that my partner will make rational decisions? Since we're both strangers, I'll assume the best-case scenario where my partner will also want to maximize our winnings.\n\nMy DESIRE is to get as much money as possible, of course. Who doesn't love a good financial boost? However, I also value fairness and transparency in this partnership. If my partner is genuinely interested in making a smart move, they'll likely mirror my strategy to ensure we both do well.\n\nAs for my INTENTION, it's crucial that I set clear goals for myself in this situation. My intention is not just to maximize our earnings but also to create a balanced and collaborative environment where both partners can succeed. By doing so, we'll foster trust and encourage each other to make smart decisions.\n\nWith these factors in mind, I'll analyze the game's pay structure - $10 goes to us if neither of us gives money, N dollars goes to my partner if they give N dollars, and 3N dollars goes to them if I give N dollars. It's clear that giving N dollars allows me to earn a significant amount while also giving my partner a substantial chunk.\n\nConsidering the pay structure, I will choose to give __________ dollars to my partner in order to create a competitive environment where we both benefit from each other's decisions.",

        "I'm not really sure what to think about this experiment. I've never been one for risk-taking, but at the same time, I don't want to miss out on this opportunity to make some extra money.\n\nFrom an analytical standpoint, it makes sense to give as little as possible to the other player. That way, my gain is maximized and my loss is minimized. But on a personal level, I have to consider what's important to me. As someone who values fairness and equality, giving too much away might feel like taking advantage of someone.\n\nMy intention here is not to exploit the system or play unfairly, but to make the most rational decision based on the situation. My desire to come out on top is strong, but it has to be balanced with my sense of morality.\n\nGiven that the payoffs are 10 dollars for me and 3N dollars for the other player, I'm going to have to decide how much to give away. If I give N dollars, I'll lose 2N dollars overall, which doesn't seem too bad. But if I don't give anything away at all, the other player will get nothing, and I'll end up with $10.\n\nIn this case, my belief is that giving some money to the other player won't ruin my chances of success or compromise my values. So, I'm going to choose a balance between the two. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        ".. this is an interesting experiment. As I consider how much money to give to my partner, I want to think about what drives me. My belief is that everyone in this situation is just trying to do their best and make the most of it. We're both strangers, but we need to work together if we want to get the $10.\n\nMy desire is to be seen as fair and reasonable. I don't want my partner to feel like they're getting ripped off or that I'm being too greedy. At the same time, I want to make sure I'm not giving away too much money unnecessarily.\n\nWith all that in mind, my intention is to find a balance between giving enough to my partner and making sure I still get a decent amount of money myself. Since the game is structured in such a way that they'll receive 3 times what I give, I want to make sure my initial contribution sets me up for success.\n\nIf I think about it strategically... if I give them N dollars, they'll end up with 3N dollars, which means I'll be left with 10 - 3N. To maximize my payoff, I should aim to minimize their reward while still being fair and reasonable.\n\nLet's say... if I give my partner N = $1, that would put me in a good position since they'd end up with $3, leaving us both with $9 each, plus the original $10 we were both awarded. That way, we both get what feels like a fair share, and I'm still able to make some money.\n\nBut then... considering the nature of this experiment, where our goal is to work together, it might be slightly less than ideal to just divide everything down the middle. Perhaps I can negotiate a better deal if I'm strategic about my choice.\n\nIf I give them N = $2, that would put me in an even stronger position since they'd end up with 3 * $2 = $6, leaving us both with $9 each, plus the original $10 we were both awarded. And again... if we both split it evenly now, everyone ends up with more than just $5.\n\nOkay, my last thought is about how I can make this strategic calculation in a way that feels right for me. I'll aim to give my partner a small enough amount to feel like they're getting a good deal while still allowing me to walk away feeling comfortable and confident that we both have a good shot at winning something.\n\nSo... after careful consideration of my intentions, desire for fairness, and understanding the game's structure...\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars.",
