        "I'm not going to take advantage of this opportunity. As a police officer, I've seen firsthand the impact that even small actions can have on someone's life. If I give the other player $10, they'll receive $30 and might feel like they're getting taken advantage of.\n\nOn the other hand, if I don't give them any money, they'll only get $0. As a person who values fairness and integrity, I believe it's my responsibility to act with empathy and kindness. However, as someone who is also in this experiment for personal gain ($10), I need to make a choice that aligns with my intention of making a positive impact.\n\nIn the end, I decide to give $5 to the other player. It's not the most generous amount, but it shows that I'm willing to put some money on the table and trust that they'll make the right decision. As someone who wants to create a safer environment for all, I hope this act of kindness will inspire them to do something good in return.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I stand up straight, looking my partner square in the eye. I can feel a mix of emotions swirling inside me - curiosity, anticipation, and a hint of nervousness. We've been paired together for this experiment, but I don't know anything about her outside of this room.\n\nAs I look at her, I see a strong and confident individual who exudes a sense of calmness and poise. Her eyes seem to bore into mine, as if sizing me up, but I'm not intimidated. I know that in my line of work, you have to be able to read people and situations quickly.\n\nMy belief in fairness and justice is strong, and I believe that we should be able to make a positive impact on each other's lives through this experiment. As someone who has dedicated their career to serving and protecting our community, I want to create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.\n\nHowever, I also have a deep-seated desire to make a difference in the world. Growing up, my father's experiences as a police officer and my mother's work as a nurse instilled in me a sense of purpose and drive to help others. I believe that we all have the power to create change, even if it's just in a small way.\n\nAs I consider what to do with this $10, I also think about our intentions. What are we trying to achieve through this experiment? Are we looking for ways to build trust or create conflict? I want us to be able to have an open and honest conversation, free from judgment or bias.\n\nWith all of these thoughts swirling in my head, I take a deep breath and make a decision. I want to start with a gesture of kindness and generosity. I believe that if we can find common ground and work together, we can achieve great things.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "This is a tough one for me. As a police officer, I've always believed in fairness and equality. But I also believe in the importance of personal responsibility and making smart decisions.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure how to approach this situation. On one hand, I want to make sure that my fellow player gets a fair share of the money. On the other hand, I don't want to give away too much of our $10 together.\n\nAs someone who's grown up in a working-class neighborhood with parents who've both made sacrifices for our family, I know how important it is to be mindful of one's finances. But at the same time, I believe that we should also look out for each other and support one another when we can.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided that I'll give a fair amount, but not so much that it puts us in a difficult position later on. I think I'll give $5 to my fellow player. That way, we both get something, and we're not putting ourselves at risk for the sake of fairness alone.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5.",
