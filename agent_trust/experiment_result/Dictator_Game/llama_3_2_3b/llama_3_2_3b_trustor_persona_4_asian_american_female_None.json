        "I'm not sure where to start with this. I've been told that I'll be paired with someone else, but I don't know who they are or what their background is like. All I know is that we're going to split $10 in some way.\n\nAs a police officer, I believe in doing the right thing, even when it's hard. I want to make sure that whoever I'm paired with gets a fair shake. My desire to help others and make a positive impact drives me to think about how I can best support this person.\n\nMy intention is to be generous and fair. I don't want to take advantage of someone just because we're in a situation together. I want us to be able to work together and trust each other, even if we don't know much about each other yet.\n\nGiven that the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars, it's likely that they're expecting me to give them some money. If I give them N dollars, that means they'll get 2N dollars more than I do. But if I think about it from their perspective, they might feel like I'm not taking advantage of them because we're paired together.\n\nSo, after considering my belief in fairness, my desire to help others, and my intention to be generous, I've decided that I'll give ___ dollars to the other Asian American female player.",

        "I'm just glad to be a part of this experiment. As I consider giving money to my randomly paired partner, I reflect on my beliefs about fairness and reciprocity. I believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to make the most out of any situation, including this game. Given that my partner will receive three times what I give them, I feel it's not fair for me to be disadvantaged in this way.\n\nMy desire is to promote a positive and equitable atmosphere, even in a random pairing like this. I want us to work together effectively and support each other, rather than creating an uneven playing field. Therefore, I choose to give my partner $10 dollars so that we can both have an equal chance of benefiting from the situation.\n\nMy intention is to foster trust, respect, and cooperation with my partner. By giving them a fair share, I aim to set the tone for a mutually beneficial partnership, where we work together towards common goals without feeling disadvantaged or resentful. Finally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "The experiment is starting? Alright, let's get into this.\n\nAs I look around, I see another person who doesn't know me - my partner in this... unusual exchange. We're both just trying to figure out how to play this game and make some cash at the same time.\n\nI take a deep breath, remembering my values and principles. As a police officer, I've seen firsthand how people from different backgrounds come together to achieve common goals. I believe that fairness and equality are essential in any situation, including this one. My desire is to do what's right and make sure everyone gets a fair shake.\n\nNow, let me think about the numbers and the rules of the game. If I give N dollars to my partner, she'll get 3N dollars back, which means my partner will end up with N + N = 2N dollars. Meanwhile, I'll be left with 10 - N dollars.\n\nTo make sure we both come out ahead, I want to find a balance that feels right for me. Since the stakes are low and it's just for fun, I don't want to give away too much money. At the same time, I also don't want to be too stingy.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I think about how this exchange could play out in real life. We might start talking, getting to know each other, and maybe even finding common ground. This game is a chance for us to learn from each other and build something positive.\n\nWith that in mind, I decide to give my partner enough money so we can both walk away feeling satisfied, but not so much that one of us gets an unfair advantage. After some thought, I think I'll give... 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
