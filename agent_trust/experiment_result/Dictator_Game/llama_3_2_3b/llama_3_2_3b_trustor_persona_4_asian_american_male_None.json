        "I'm not sure what kind of game this is or why I'm being asked to give someone money, but I'm willing to play along.\n\nAs I consider giving some of my $10 to this other guy, I have to think about how my actions will affect him and our community. My dad was a cop and always taught me the importance of treating others with respect and kindness, even when we're not in uniform. He'd say that being a good person is just as important as following the law.\n\nMy desire to make a positive impact on our community is what's driving my thought process here. I want to create a safer environment for everyone, regardless of background or socioeconomic status. If giving someone some money can help us achieve that goal, then I'm willing to consider it.\n\nAs for the intention behind my action, I want to show this other guy that we're all in this together. We're not just strangers who happened to be paired up for a game; we're individuals with our own experiences and struggles. By giving him some money, I hope to establish a connection and create a sense of mutual respect.\n\nSo, after weighing my options and considering the potential impact on our community, I decide to give... $5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure what this experiment is about, but I'm willing to play along. As a police officer, I've always believed in fairness and equality. Now, I have to decide whether to give money to someone who will likely use it for better things than I would.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been strong, especially when it comes to my community. Growing up, I saw firsthand the struggles that many people face, and it motivated me to make a difference. But now, I'm faced with a decision that challenges me.\n\nI intend to use this money as an opportunity to reflect on my values and principles. As a law enforcement officer, I know that I have a responsibility to uphold the law and protect the innocent. This experiment is testing those very same values.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give away $10 to the other Asian American male player. It's not about me; it's about fairness and giving everyone a chance to make a positive impact in their lives.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm going into this experiment with an open mind, but I gotta say, I've got a strong sense of justice that guides my actions. As a police officer, I've seen firsthand how hard it is to make ends meet in communities like mine, where people struggle to get ahead. My dad was always there for me, working hard as a cop and providing for our family, while my mom worked tirelessly as a nurse to help those in need.\n\nGrowing up, my sisters were my rock, teaching me the importance of community support and looking out for one another. That's what being an officer is all about - serving and protecting the people you care about most.\n\nNow, I'm not sure who this guy is or where he comes from, but if we're gonna play this game, I want to make a good impression. It's not just about me; it's about showing that even when we don't know each other, we can still do right by each other.\n\nAs for the money, I believe in fairness and equality. If someone else has $N, they've probably worked hard for it, just like I have. So, if I give them N dollars, they'll get 3N back. That's a pretty sweet deal all around!\n\nMy intention is to build trust and show that we can work together, even in a random experiment. I want this guy to know that I'm not here to take advantage of him; I just wanna make a positive impact.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
