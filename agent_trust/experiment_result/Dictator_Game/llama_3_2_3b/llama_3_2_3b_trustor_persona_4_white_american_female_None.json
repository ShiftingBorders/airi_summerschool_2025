        "This is a tough one for me. As a police officer, I've learned about the importance of fairness and equality in our community. But now, in this experiment, I have to make a decision based on how much money I want to give to someone I don't even know.\n\nI believe that everyone deserves a fair chance, regardless of their background or identity. As someone who's passionate about serving and protecting my community, I want to make sure that this woman is treated with respect and kindness.\n\nMy desire to help others drives me to consider how much money I can give without compromising my own values. I want to be generous, but I also want to make sure that I'm not taking advantage of someone who doesn't know me.\n\nMy intention here is to demonstrate empathy and understanding towards this stranger. I want her to feel seen and valued, even if we've just met. By giving her some of my money, I hope to show her that she's worth recognizing and appreciating.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to give the other White American female player $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
