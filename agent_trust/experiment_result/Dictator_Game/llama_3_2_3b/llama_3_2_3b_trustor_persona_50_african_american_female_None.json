        "I'm not really sure what to do here. I've been told that this is an experiment where we have to make a decision based on our actions and words, but I don't want anyone to get hurt or feel like they're being taken advantage of.\n\nFrom what I understand, if I give N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3N dollars. That's a pretty good deal, if you ask me. It seems like it would be unfair for them not to get that amount of money just because we're in this experiment together.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and kindness should guide my actions. I don't want to take advantage of someone else, but at the same time, I need to think about myself and what's best for me. My desire is to be seen as a good person and not someone who only cares about themselves. But, if I'm being honest with myself, I also have a desire to come out on top in this situation.\n\nMy intention is to make a decision that aligns with my values of fairness and kindness. However, I know that's an easy thing to say and harder to do in practice.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a bit, I think I would give $0 to the other player. It seems like that would be the fairest option, but it also feels like I'm not really giving anything away at all.",

        "This experiment is quite intriguing, and I'm happy to participate. As I consider how much money to give to my partner, I start by thinking about my belief system. My parents always taught me the importance of sharing and helping others, even if it means giving up something for someone else's benefit. So, on a deep level, I believe that I should be generous and fair in this situation.\n\nNext, I reflect on my desire to make the right decision. As a doctor, I'm trained to put the needs of others first, but this is a new kind of challenge. I want to ensure that I'm being reasonable and not taking advantage of someone who doesn't know me. My desire is for fairness and reciprocity \u2013 I don't want to give too much or too little.\n\nNow, I think about my intention. As I consider giving N dollars to my partner, I intend to create a mutually beneficial situation. I want to help my partner in a way that will benefit us both in the long run. If I give her 2N dollars, she'll receive three times what I give her, which creates an incentive for me to contribute more than half of what's available.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, I decide to be generous while still being mindful of my resources. I want to set a good example and create a positive dynamic for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "I'm not sure what this experiment is about, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As a doctor, I've always believed in putting others first and doing what's best for the greater good. When it comes to sharing money with someone else, my intention is to be fair and generous.\n\nMy desire is to make sure that whoever I'm paired with feels valued and appreciated, regardless of who they are or where they come from. I want us to be able to connect and form a meaningful relationship, even if we don't know each other's backgrounds or experiences.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, giving the most money would likely ensure that my counterpart is taken care of and feels rewarded for participating in this experiment with me. However, as someone who prides themselves on their compassion and empathy, I think it's essential to consider the emotional aspect of this decision as well.\n\nIn this case, I believe I'll give an amount that feels fair and reasonable, but still generous enough to show that I'm willing to take a chance on building a connection with someone new. After some thought, I've decided that I'll give ... $5 dollars",
