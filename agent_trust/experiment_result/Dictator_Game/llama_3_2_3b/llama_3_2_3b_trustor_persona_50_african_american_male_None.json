        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nAs I think about this, I believe that giving money away to someone in need can bring joy and relief to their life. It's a simple act of kindness that can make a big difference. I also believe that if we work together and support each other, we can achieve great things.\n\nMy desire is to do what feels right, not just for myself, but for the other person as well. I want us to come out of this experiment with something positive to take away. We should be able to trust and respect each other, even if we don't know much about each other's backgrounds or lives.\n\nAs for my intention, I'm choosing to give generously because I truly believe in the power of kindness and generosity. I want to start this relationship off on a positive note, one that's built on mutual respect and understanding.",

        "This is a difficult decision for me. As a doctor, I've always been taught to put others first and prioritize their well-being above my own. In this situation, I believe it's essential to consider the potential gain of giving money to someone who may be less fortunate.\n\nMy desire in this situation is not personal gain, but rather to make a positive impact on another person's life. I want to help someone who might be in need and provide them with an opportunity to make the most of their financial situation.\n\nAs for my intention, it's clear that I'm not doing this out of obligation or expectation of something in return. My intention is genuine, coming from a place of kindness and empathy. I believe that giving money to someone who needs it more than I do can have a ripple effect of positivity in our community.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give $5 to the other African American male player. Giving away half of my $10 would not align with my values as a doctor and a compassionate person. However, giving $5 would allow me to make a positive impact while still ensuring that I have enough money for myself.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to participate. As I think about it, I believe that fairness is key in this situation. We both came into this with nothing, and we're leaving with $10 if we do our job correctly. But, we can make more money by doing well. My desire is to earn as much as possible, but at the same time, I want to show respect for my opponent.\n\nAs I weigh my options, I realize that my intention should be to give just enough so that both of us have a good chance of succeeding. If I give away too much money, my opponent will have an unfair advantage and may not feel motivated to do well. On the other hand, if I don't give anything, we'll both struggle.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided on a strategy. Since my opponent is equally unknown to me as I am to them, I believe it's only fair that we start out with an equal chance of winning. This way, neither of us has an unfair advantage.\n\nTherefore, Finally, I will give $5",
