        "I've been thinking about this carefully. As a doctor, I understand the importance of fairness and equal treatment for everyone, regardless of their background or identity. In this experiment, both parties are unaware of each other's identities, which adds an extra layer of objectivity.\n\nMy belief is that I should treat my partner with respect and kindness, just as I would any other person. This doesn't necessarily mean giving them a large sum of money, but rather being considerate of their needs and emotions.\n\nMy desire is to make sure that this transaction is fair and equitable for both parties. Given that the Asian American female player will receive 3 times what I give them, I want to choose an amount that shows I value our partnership but also acknowledges the power dynamic at play here.\n\nMy intention is to be honest and transparent in my decision-making process. I'm not trying to gain any advantage or manipulate the outcome; I simply want to make a choice that aligns with my values as a caring and compassionate person.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have decided to give $5 dollars to the other Asian American female player. This amount is symbolic of our equal partnership, but also takes into account the fact that they will be receiving more in return.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5",

        "This is an interesting experiment. My belief system tells me that everyone deserves equal opportunities to benefit from this exchange, regardless of their background or personal characteristics. I'm not here to judge anyone based on external factors.\n\nMy desire in this situation is to maximize the amount of money I can give away while still being fiscally responsible. However, since the payout ratio is 3:1 in favor of the other player, it's likely that giving them more will actually benefit me in the long run.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to play fair and make sure that the other player doesn't feel taken advantage of simply because we're from different backgrounds. I also want to take advantage of this situation to learn more about the experiment and how it can help me grow as a person.\n\nConsidering these factors, I'd like to give $5 to the other Asian American female player. This amount seems reasonable, and I believe it will allow us both to benefit equally from the exchange.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The experiment! I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm willing to give it a try. As I think about this situation, my belief is that fairness and equality are important values in any interaction. I want to make sure that the other person feels valued and respected, regardless of who we are or where we come from.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive experience for both of us. If I can do that, then we can focus on getting to know each other as individuals, rather than just being paired up for this experiment.\n\nAs for my intention, it's simple: I want to be kind and compassionate towards others. I believe that everyone deserves to feel good about themselves, and I'm willing to take a chance to make that happen here.\n\nWith all of these thoughts in mind, I think I'll give the other Asian American female player a fair share of the money. If we're going to play this game together, then I want us to both feel like we're getting a good deal.\n\nSo, I'm going to give 5 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",
