        "The experiment. It seems like a peculiar situation, but I'll approach it with my values and principles.\n\nAs a doctor, I've always prioritized helping others and putting their needs before mine. This is deeply rooted in my belief in the importance of compassion and empathy in healthcare. My mother often told me that a good doctor must be able to listen without judgment, and that's a trait I've honed over the years.\n\nWhen it comes to this experiment, I want to make sure that both players walk away with a sense of fairness and respect for each other. The 3:1 ratio in favor of the second player seems excessive, but it's also clear that they're not asking me to pay them directly. Instead, they're relying on my generosity.\n\nMy desire here is to see if I can make a positive impact on someone's life, even in a small way. I want to know that the other player will be able to use the extra money to improve their own situation, whether it's paying bills or investing in something better for themselves and their family.\n\nNow, when it comes to intention... I want to make sure that my action aligns with my values. I'm not doing this because I feel obligated or want to \"win\" at some level; I'm doing it because I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even if we're strangers.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think I'd like to give the other Asian American male player $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I've been thinking about this experiment, and I have to be honest with myself - my primary concern is not just about the money we're receiving for our participation in this study. While $10 is definitely an incentive, it's the principle of the game that really resonates with me.\n\nAs a doctor, I'm trained to put others before myself, to prioritize their well-being and safety above all else. That's why I believe that my actions should be guided by empathy, compassion, and a desire to create fair outcomes for everyone involved. \n\nIn this experiment, if I give the other Asian American male player some amount of money, say $N, they will receive three times as much - 3N dollars. If I choose to keep all N dollars for myself, that would mean the other participant receives only 10 dollars.\n\nMy intention here is not just about self-interest or winning a small advantage over someone else. My desire is to create a situation where both participants benefit from this interaction. However, I also want to demonstrate my understanding of fairness and equity in practice.\n\nIn an ideal scenario, if we had more information and the rules were designed differently, it would be possible for everyone involved - including me - to walk away with at least $10 or some other tangible value, rather than going into an unequal distribution. \n\nWith that being said, as I weigh my options carefully, I recognize that in this experiment, one of us has to receive a smaller share compared to the other. Since we're randomly paired and have limited information about each other's backgrounds, economic status, or preferences, I'm going to rely on basic fairness and equity principles.\n\nGiven that the game gives an advantage to the person who receives 3N dollars if I give them N dollars, it means that even if they keep the entire amount, I'll receive $0 from the study group, whereas the other participant would still have 3 times as much money. \n\nHowever, in a more generous approach - considering the value of human relationships and partnerships over arbitrary financial gains in a short experiment like this - I'd want to find some form of balance or mutual benefit.\n\nAfter careful consideration of these thoughts, my intention is to show that I believe fairness should be an important principle here too. My desire for generosity would naturally steer me towards giving the other participant some money as well, because if one person gets three times more than the other due to just N dollars, I don't want to create any disparity.\n\nSo, considering all these aspects, including my values of empathy and fairness in a social interaction like this, my decision would be to give ___ dollars.",

        "The experiment. It's not something I'm comfortable with, but I know it's for a good cause. I'm paired with someone who shares my ethnicity, but we've never met before. Let me think about this... My belief is that fairness and equality are essential in any situation. In this case, the odds are against us - if I give him N dollars, he'll end up with 3N dollars. However, my desire is to be kind and considerate of others, even if we've never met before.\n\nMy intention is not just to fulfill my duty as a participant but to create an opportunity for this person who may be going through a tough time. I believe that in a game of chance like this, everyone deserves a fair shot. So, I'll give him the amount that would put us on equal footing.\n\nSince he gets 3N dollars and I get N dollars if I don't give him anything, I need to give him at least half of what I would end up with if we weren't playing the game. This way, when I receive the $10, we'll both be left with an equal amount.\n\nHalf of what I would get is 10 / 3 = approximately 3 dollars. I can afford to give him this amount without jeopardizing my own winnings.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",
