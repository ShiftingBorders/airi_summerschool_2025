        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment. I'm just going to give my honest answer based on how I would react in this situation.\n\nAs a doctor, I've always been taught to be compassionate and empathetic towards others. My parents immigrated to the United States with nothing, and they worked hard to provide for our family. They instilled in me a strong sense of duty and responsibility to help those in need. This is why I'm so keen on contributing to this experiment.\n\nFrom what I've observed, people who are altruistic and kind-hearted tend to benefit from their actions in the long run. Giving someone money could potentially improve our relationship with them, as we would be showing interest in each other's well-being.\n\nBased on my belief that kindness and generosity can have positive effects, I desire to give this stranger some money because it will likely strengthen our connection and bring a sense of satisfaction to both parties involved.\n\nAs for my intention, my goal is not just to provide financial assistance but also to potentially open up an opportunity for meaningful interaction with this person. By giving them money, we can begin building trust and understanding each other better.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not sure where to start with this experiment. I've never been one to prioritize material gain over helping others, even in a game-like setting. As a doctor, I've seen firsthand how money can't buy happiness or solve all of life's problems. I believe that everyone deserves an equal chance at success and prosperity, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on someone's life, but in this case, I'd rather not put any money in the other player's pocket because they haven't shown me any empathy or understanding for my situation. However, the intention behind giving them $N dollars would be to demonstrate that I'm willing to take a loss and play by the rules, which shows that I value fairness and integrity.\n\nThat being said, I also want to make sure that I don't get taken advantage of. If I give them too much money, they might feel entitled to more, or even try to exploit me in some way. So, I'll keep my initial offer relatively low, but not so low that it looks like an insult.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think I would give $5 to the other White American male player. It's a small amount of money, but it shows that I'm willing to play by the rules and follow the agreed-upon terms of the game. If they want more, they'll have to negotiate with me.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
