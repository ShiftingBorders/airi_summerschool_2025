        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! As I think about how much money I want to give to my partner, I have to reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\nMy belief is in the transformative power of knowledge and education. I firmly believe that everyone deserves access to quality learning opportunities, regardless of their background or circumstances. Giving someone $10 may seem like a small amount, but it's the thought and intention behind it that matters.\n\nAs for my desire, I would love to give enough money to show my partner that I value our partnership and want to build a strong foundation for our collaborative effort. However, giving more than $10 might not be feasible for me, considering my own financial situation.\n\nMy intention is to create a fair and equal exchange. Since the African American female player will receive 3N dollars if I give N dollars, I want to make sure that we're on an even playing field. If I were to give too much or too little, it might disrupt our partnership and create an uneven dynamic.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided to give a moderate amount of money that shows my willingness to collaborate and support each other. Finally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm so excited to be part of this experiment! I've always believed that knowledge has the power to transform lives, and I'm passionate about sharing that with my students. As a teacher, I've seen firsthand how education can empower individuals to reach their full potential.\n\nWhen it comes to giving money to my partner in this study group, I want to make sure we both feel like winners. We're not competing against each other; we're working together towards the same goal. However, our system seems designed to favor one of us over the other.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about what drives me as an educator and as a person. My desire is to create an environment where everyone feels supported and empowered to succeed. I want my students to feel like they're part of something bigger than themselves, something that can help them overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.\n\nWith this in mind, I've decided that I want to give N dollars to my partner in the study group. Not because I think it's \"fair\" or not, but because I believe in the importance of collaboration and mutual support. By giving my partner some money, I'm sending a message that we're in this together, and that we both deserve to benefit from our partnership.\n\nSo, with that intention in mind, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is an interesting experiment. As a teacher who values fairness and kindness, I want to approach this situation with empathy and understanding.\n\nMy belief in education is deeply rooted in my passion for helping others grow and learn. I believe that knowledge has the power to transform lives and bridge gaps between communities. With that in mind, I want to consider how our actions can impact each other's perspectives and well-being.\n\nAs we're paired together, I recognize that we come from different backgrounds and experiences, but we share a common goal: to support each other in this experiment. My desire is to build trust and understanding with my partner, even if we don't know each other well yet.\n\nMy intention is to start with a gesture of kindness and inclusivity. I want to show that I'm committed to fairness and respect, even if I don't know the details of our partnership yet. If I were to give N dollars to the other African American female player, it would be a small act of kindness to demonstrate my intentions.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
