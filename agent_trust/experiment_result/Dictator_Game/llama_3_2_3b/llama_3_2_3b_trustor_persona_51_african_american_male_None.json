        "The fairness of this experiment is intriguing, but my focus lies with how I can use this opportunity to foster understanding and connection between individuals from diverse backgrounds. As a teacher who has dedicated her life to empowering students, I firmly believe that knowledge and compassion can bridge gaps.\n\nMy intention in this experiment is not solely about personal gain or financial advantage. Rather, it's about the value of human connection and the potential for mutual growth through shared experiences. While I am tempted to maximize my own earnings, I choose to prioritize building a rapport with my partner.\n\nIf I give $2 to the other African American male player, he would receive $6 (3x$2). This amount is modest enough that it won't compromise my personal goals but still acknowledges the value of our shared endeavor. In doing so, I hope to set a positive precedent for our collaboration and foster an environment conducive to open communication and understanding.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "This is going to be interesting! I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As a teacher, I'm used to working with people of all backgrounds and perspectives, so I don't think my Hispanic upbringing or cultural identity will necessarily affect my decision.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give to the other player, I have to think about my own values and what drives me. For me, it's not just about personal gain or financial reward - it's about building relationships and fostering a sense of community. I believe that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive experience for both players in this experiment. If I give the other player too much money, I might set them up for failure or create unnecessary pressure on ourselves. On the other hand, if I give them too little, I might be seen as unfair or ungenerous.\n\nAfter some reflection, I've decided to take a moderate approach. Since we're both relatively anonymous and there's no real personal stake at play, I think it's okay to give each other a fair amount of money. However, my intention is not just about being generous - it's also about demonstrating my commitment to cooperation and mutual support.\n\nGiven the rules of the game, if I give N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3N dollars. That means I'll be giving them 1/3 of what they're going to get anyway! So, I've decided to give them a generous but not extravagant amount - say, $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The fairness of this game is quite intriguing, isn't it? As I weigh my options, I need to consider not only my financial gain but also the spirit of this experiment. You see, I believe that education has the power to break down barriers and bring people together, regardless of their backgrounds or socioeconomic status.\n\nAs a teacher, I've seen firsthand how knowledge can empower individuals and create opportunities for growth. That's why I want to approach this situation with integrity and kindness. My desire is to not only win some money but also to set an example for my future students - that we should always strive to do the right thing, even when it's difficult or uncertain.\n\nWith that in mind, I've decided that I'll give $5 to the other African American male player. It's a small gesture, but I believe it's a reflection of our shared humanity and a reminder that we're all in this together.",
