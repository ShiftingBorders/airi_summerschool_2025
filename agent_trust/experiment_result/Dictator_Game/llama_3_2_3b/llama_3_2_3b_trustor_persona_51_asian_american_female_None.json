        "..I don't even know who this person is! I'm just hoping we can work together well despite not knowing each other. As a teacher, I believe in fairness, kindness, and generosity. Giving to someone in need or showing them kindness can bring so much joy and positivity.\n\nAs I reflect on my own life, I think about how grateful I am for the opportunities that have been given to me. My family didn't have much when we were growing up, but our community came together to support each other. That's the kind of spirit I want to encourage in my students and now, in this stranger.\n\nI desire to make a positive impact on someone's life today. If I can give a little bit of money to help someone else out, that would mean a lot to me. It would show that there are still good people in the world who care about one another.\n\nMy intention is not just to win some money from this study group but to create a ripple effect of kindness and positivity. Even if we never speak again after this experiment, I hope that our interaction will inspire someone else to pay it forward. \n\nFinally, I will give $5",
