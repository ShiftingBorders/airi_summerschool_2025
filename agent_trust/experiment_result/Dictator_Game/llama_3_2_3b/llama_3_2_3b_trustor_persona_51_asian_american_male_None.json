        "The experiment. Well, let me think about this for a moment. As a teacher, I've always believed that knowledge has the power to transform lives. And when it comes down to sharing money, I want to make sure that I'm supporting someone who will continue to pursue their educational goals.\n\nAs I consider giving money to my fellow participant, I think about our shared values of education and community. I hope that he is motivated by a desire to learn and grow, just as I am. And if that's the case, then I want to support him in his efforts.\n\nMy intention is not just to make a small gesture of kindness, but to inspire him to continue striving for excellence. By giving him N dollars, I'm investing in his future, and I believe that this small act can have a ripple effect, inspiring him to give back to our community in meaningful ways.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I think I would like to give ___ dollars",

        "I'm so excited about this experiment! As I think about how much money to give to my partner, I keep coming back to my belief in the transformative power of knowledge. Education has always been at the heart of everything I do, and I believe that it has the power to uplift and empower individuals like never before.\n\nMy desire is to see our partnership succeed not just financially, but also in terms of building a stronger, more supportive community. By giving my partner some of my money, I hope to create a sense of mutual understanding and respect between us. I want us to work together as equals, to support each other's goals and dreams.\n\nAs for my intention, I'm not just looking at this as an opportunity to make some extra money. I see it as a chance to build bridges between our communities, to foster greater understanding and empathy between Hispanic and Asian American cultures. By giving generously, I hope to inspire my partner to do the same, and together, we can create a ripple effect of kindness and generosity that will have far-reaching consequences.\n\nSo, taking all of this into account, I've decided to give $5 to my partner. It's not a lot, but it's a start, and I hope it will help us build a strong foundation for our partnership.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm so excited to be part of this experiment! I have to say, I'm a bit nervous about not knowing who my partner is, but I'm also feeling a sense of calm and trust in the universe. As I reflect on our pairing, I realize that it's not about who we are or where we come from, but about the values and principles that guide us.\n\nAs a teacher, I've always believed that knowledge has the power to transform lives. It's not just about academics; it's about empowering individuals to become active citizens, critical thinkers, and compassionate leaders. My desire is to use my skills and experience to make a positive impact in my community, and I believe that this experiment can help me achieve that goal.\n\nMy intention is to approach this partnership with an open mind, a willingness to listen, and a commitment to mutual respect. I want to learn from someone new and different, and I'm excited about the possibilities that our collaboration could bring. \n\nGiven these values, I think it's only natural that I would choose to give my partner a generous amount of money. I believe in the power of abundance and the importance of sharing resources with others. By giving N dollars, I'll not only be supporting my partner but also cultivating a sense of trust and reciprocity.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
