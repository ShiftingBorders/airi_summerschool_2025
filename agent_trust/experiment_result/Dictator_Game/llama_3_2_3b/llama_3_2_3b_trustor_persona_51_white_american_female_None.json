        "The experiment is already underway? Well, I must say, I'm intrigued by this unexpected pairing. As a teacher who has dedicated her life to empowering others through education, I believe in the value of reciprocity and mutual support.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give to my partner, I reflect on my desire to create a positive experience for both of us. I don't know my partner yet, but I sense that we share a common goal - to learn from each other and grow as individuals.\n\nMy intention is not just about accumulating wealth, but about building connections and fostering understanding between our two diverse backgrounds. I want to encourage open communication, trust, and empathy in this partnership.\n\nGiven these principles, I decide to give an amount that will allow us to start fresh, without any preconceptions or biases. I'll give $5 to my partner, not because it's the maximum amount I can give, but because it represents a clean slate, a chance for us to begin anew together.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This experiment is quite interesting, but I'm not sure what my intentions should be. As a teacher, I've always put the needs of others before my own, especially when it comes to my students. But in this case, I'm faced with a situation where I need to think about how much to give to someone who doesn't know me and isn't from my community.\n\nI believe that knowledge is power, and I want to use this opportunity to learn more about someone new. I also desire fairness and equality, especially when it comes to sharing resources. But as I reflect on my values, I realize that I need to consider the intentions behind my actions.\n\nIn this experiment, I'm not just giving money; I'm building a connection with someone who doesn't know me. I want to show them that we can trust each other and work together towards a common goal. So, I'm going to give away a significant amount of money to build that foundation of trust and respect.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "This is going to be interesting. I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give my partner, I have to think about our shared goal of receiving $10. Since we're not getting any information about each other, I'll focus on the mathematical aspect of this situation. Let's say I give x dollars to my partner. Then, she receives 3x dollars.\n\nThe total amount of money we both receive is x + 3x = 4x. According to the rules of this experiment, we need to get a total of $10. So, we can set up an equation: 4x = 10.\n\nSolving for x, I find that x = 2.5.\n\nNow, let's think about my intention behind giving money to my partner. Is it just about the math, or is there something more? As a teacher, I believe in fostering connections and building relationships with my students. While I don't know much about my partner, I want to treat her with kindness and respect. If I give her $2.50, she'll receive 3x = 7.50 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $2.",
