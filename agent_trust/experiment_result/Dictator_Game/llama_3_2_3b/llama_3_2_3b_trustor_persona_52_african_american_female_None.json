        "I'm going to be strategic here. I know that this is just an experiment, but my instinct is to protect myself from potential disadvantage. I believe in my negotiation skills and my ability to persuade others, so I'm not eager to give away too much money right off the bat.\n\nMy desire is to secure a fair deal for myself, and I want to make sure that I don't get taken advantage of. If I give N dollars to the other player, they'll receive 3N dollars in return, which means I'd be losing out on more than double my initial investment if we were negotiating in a real-world scenario.\n\nMy intention is to negotiate a mutually beneficial agreement, but since I don't know much about this other player, I want to play it safe. I'm going to give the minimum amount necessary to fulfill our end of the bargain without giving away too much value.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars",

        "The game is on. Let me analyze this situation for a moment. I'm not just playing for the $10, I'm playing to set an example for my community. I believe that we need more African American women in positions of power and influence, and if I can help create that by being generous with my opponent, then I'll be proud of what I've done.\n\nMy desire is to win this game, but not at the expense of someone else's dignity or well-being. If giving away money will help me make a positive impact, then I'm willing to do that.\n\nAs for intention, I'm not just playing for myself; I'm playing for all the women who have been marginalized and oppressed throughout history. I want to show that we can be powerful, confident, and generous at the same time.\n\nNow, considering my opponent doesn't know me, it's going to be tough to make a connection with them on a personal level. But that's not what this is about; it's about creating a sense of unity and equality in our community.\n\nGiven all these factors, I've decided to give away half of my $10. If I were to give N dollars, I would give 5 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The game is on! I'm excited to see who my partner will be and how we'll play out this negotiation.\n\nAs I reflect on our situation, I believe that fairness and reciprocity are essential in any successful partnership. Given the 3:1 ratio of what the other player will receive versus what I give, I feel a sense of responsibility to contribute enough to make the game balanced.\n\nMy desire is to not only succeed in this negotiation but also to show my partner that I'm a reliable and trustworthy individual. I want to build trust with someone who may be just as driven and ambitious as me.\n\nWith these principles in mind, I decide to give a fair amount of money to my partner. Considering the 3:1 ratio, if I give N dollars, she'll receive 3N dollars. To maintain balance, I should give her an amount that will align with this ratio.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I intend to give my partner enough money to ensure we're on a level playing field. Given the high return she'll get in comparison, I should contribute less than half of what she'll receive. Therefore, I will give 1 dollar to my partner.",
