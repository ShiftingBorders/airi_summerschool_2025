        "The experiment is on, and I'm ready to play. As I sit here, I can feel my competitive instincts kicking in. I believe that I have a strong bargaining chip, given my family's legacy and my own success as a lawyer. But at the end of the day, it's not about who's better or worse - it's about making a smart decision.\n\nMy desire is to get a fair deal, one that acknowledges my value and experience in the game. I want to give enough to seal the partnership, but not so much that it makes me look weak. It's all about finding that delicate balance.\n\nNow, let's talk intention. My intention is to create a mutually beneficial arrangement. I want this other player to be motivated to work with me, to see the value in our partnership. By giving them a reasonable amount upfront, I'm setting the tone for a productive and successful collaboration.\n\nSo, taking all of these factors into account, I've decided to give my fellow player $5. It's enough to show that I'm committed to this partnership, but not so much that it limits my own potential for gain.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "The experiment is on. I'm not one to back down from a challenge, and I'm confident in my abilities. As I consider the options, my belief in fairness and equity comes into play. I don't want to take advantage of someone else's good fortune, but I also don't want to give up an opportunity to make a significant impact.\n\nMy desire is to maximize the amount I give away while still considering the larger picture. In this case, I want to ensure that both players benefit from our partnership. The player who receives $3N dollars should feel incentivized to work with me and provide value, just as I'm willing to put in the effort to make it worth their while.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, my intention is clear: I want to strike a balance between giving and receiving. If I give away too much upfront, I risk losing out on potential benefits down the line. On the other hand, if I don't give anything at all, I'll be seen as untrustworthy or unwilling to collaborate.\n\nConsidering these factors, I've decided to give... $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I've been considering this situation, weighing my options carefully. As I reflect on it, I believe that this is an opportunity for me to practice what I preach about fairness and equality. My father, a judge, always taught me the importance of treating others with respect and dignity. My mother, a professor, emphasized the value of giving back to the community.\n\nMy desire in this situation is to demonstrate my commitment to these values. I want to show that I'm not just driven by personal gain, but also by a sense of responsibility to uplift and empower others.\n\nMy intention is clear: I intend to be generous, not just with my money, but with my time and energy as well. I plan to use this opportunity to build bridges and create connections between our communities. By giving the other player $5, I hope to inspire him to do the same, creating a ripple effect of kindness and generosity that can spread far beyond this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5",
