        "The dynamics of this experiment are quite intriguing. As I reflect on my own values and goals, I realize that I am driven by a strong desire to create positive change in society. My work as a lawyer often takes me into the trenches of social justice issues, and I've seen firsthand the impact that effective advocacy can have.\n\nIn this context, I believe that our partnership has the potential to achieve far more than we could alone. By working together, we can pool our skills and expertise to make a meaningful difference. My intention is to collaborate with my fellow player in a way that maximizes our collective impact.\n\nGiven the payout structure, I would give N dollars to the other Asian American female player. This choice reflects my belief in the power of collaboration, my desire to work together towards a common goal, and my intention to empower my fellow partner to make a meaningful contribution. By giving her some of my initial money, I'm creating an opportunity for us to share the risk and reap the rewards of our partnership.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I take a deep breath, reflecting on my decision-making process. As I consider how much money to give to my partner in this experiment, I think about what's at stake for me. I want to make a choice that aligns with my values and reflects my personality as a confident and assertive individual.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and reciprocity are important aspects of any partnership or relationship. While I'm not expecting anything in return from my partner, I believe it's essential to start this transaction on an equal footing. However, I also consider the fact that I'm giving money to someone I don't know, which adds an element of uncertainty.\n\nMy desire is to make a choice that showcases my negotiation skills and demonstrates my ability to think strategically. I want to give enough money to show that I'm willing to participate in this experiment and work with my partner, but not so much that it would be unreasonable for me to expect something in return.\n\nMy intention is to create a mutually beneficial situation where both of us can learn from each other and gain valuable insights from the experience. By giving a significant amount of money upfront, I aim to set a positive tone for our collaboration and encourage my partner to do the same.\n\nAfter weighing these factors, I decide to give $5 to my partner. This amount strikes me as a fair starting point, allowing us both to establish a foundation for our partnership without putting too much pressure on each other.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
