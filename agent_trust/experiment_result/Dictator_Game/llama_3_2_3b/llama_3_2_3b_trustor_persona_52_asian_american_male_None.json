        "Let me get into my mindset.\n\nAs I stand here, looking at this table with a stranger who's about to change my life - or not - I can feel a mix of emotions swirling inside me. On one hand, I have a strong desire to succeed and make the most out of this opportunity. As a lawyer, I'm all about winning cases and closing deals. This situation is no different.\n\nMy belief in negotiation is that if I give away too much upfront, I'll be setting myself up for failure later on. But if I play it smart, if I can build trust with my opponent, maybe we can come out on top together.\n\nBut what's driving this? What's my intention here? It's simple: I want to maximize my own gains without losing sight of the bigger picture. I believe that by giving away a certain amount, I'll not only increase my chances of success but also demonstrate my integrity and willingness to take risks.\n\nAnd now, let's look at the numbers. If I give N dollars, the other guy gets 3N. That's a big advantage for him, but it means I have to be strategic about how much I give away. If I'm feeling generous, I might want to give a bit more than if I was playing strictly self-interest.\n\nAfter considering all this, my mind is made up. My intention is to make a smart move that balances risk and reward. And based on my calculations...\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The game's on. Let me analyze this situation. I've got a sum of $10 at my disposal, and I'm expected to give some of it to this mystery Asian American player. Now, my belief is that we're all in this together - we're both pawns in a much larger study. So, I'm going to put my trust in the system.\n\nMy desire here is not just about making a good impression or achieving some external validation; it's about playing by the rules and showing respect for the person across from me. I want us to start on a positive note, despite our anonymity. It's essential to create a fair and equal environment for both of us.\n\nAs for my intention, I'm choosing this particular option because I believe it's the fairest way to distribute the money. By giving N dollars, I'm taking a calculated risk - not too much, not too little. The 3N dollar response is substantial enough to show our potential willingness to invest in each other, but still keeps my initial contribution reasonable.\n\nWith all that considered, I've decided to give $5 to this Asian American player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm not going to fall for this. I've seen too many games like this where people try to manipulate each other into giving away more money than they need to. As a successful lawyer, I know how to negotiate and advocate for myself.\n\nMy belief is that I deserve the $10 just as much as anyone else in this study group. I'm not going to sacrifice my own financial interests for someone I don't even know. That's not what negotiation is all about - it's about being fair and reasonable, not about giving away too much of your own hard-earned money.\n\nMy desire is to come out of this situation with a strong bargaining position, not weakened by giving away too much. I need to make sure that whoever I give money to will appreciate the gesture and remember my generosity.\n\nMy intention is to find a balance between being fair and protecting my interests. If I give N dollars to the other player, it means they'll receive 3N dollars, which is a good deal for them. But at the same time, I need to make sure that my contribution doesn't cripple me financially.\n\nGiven these considerations, I decide to play it smart. Since we both know what's at stake, let's make this a mutually beneficial transaction. If I give X dollars to the other player, they'll get 3X dollars, which means they'll appreciate my generosity and be more willing to return the favor in our next interactions.\n\nNow, let's think strategically here. To ensure that I'm not overpaying for the privilege of doing someone a good deed, I want to make sure that X is reasonable enough so they don't feel like they've taken advantage of me, but also strategic enough so they'll want to return the favor later.\n\nTo achieve this balance, I choose N = $5. If I give $5, the other player gets $15 (3 * $5). This gives us both a good starting point for future interactions without putting me at a significant disadvantage.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5",
