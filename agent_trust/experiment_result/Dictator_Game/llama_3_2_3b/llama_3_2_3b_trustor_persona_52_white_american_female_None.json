        "The art of negotiation. As a seasoned lawyer, I always approach situations with a keen mind and a strategic mindset. In this experiment, I'm not just thinking about myself, but also considering my counterpart's perspective.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality are essential principles in any interaction. I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or demographics. However, I also recognize that power dynamics can play a significant role in negotiations.\n\nGiven the asymmetrical structure of this experiment, where my counterpart receives triple the amount of money compared to what I receive for giving her some dollars, my desire is to strike a balance. I want to find a middle ground that acknowledges my own needs while also showing respect and empathy towards my counterpart.\n\nMy intention is to be strategic yet principled. I'm not here to hold back or become overly emotional; I want to focus on finding a mutually beneficial solution that recognizes the inherent value of both parties involved.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I've decided to give a reasonable amount of money to demonstrate my commitment to fairness and cooperation. After careful consideration, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I'm not going to engage in a transaction that would disadvantage me or my fellow player based solely on her race. This isn't about giving money because she's white; it's about making a fair deal.\n\nMy belief is that we're all equals in this situation, and I shouldn't be held back by arbitrary assumptions. My intention is to negotiate from a place of equality and mutual respect. \n\nGiven the information, my desire is for both of us to walk away with the same amount, or at least as close to it as possible.\n\nIf I give her N dollars, she'll receive 3N dollars, which means she'll have three times what I do in return for just one dollar. This isn't a fair exchange. \n\nSo, I won't give her anything less than the $10 I started with. That's my belief, my desire, and my intention.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "I'm not going to play along with this game. I believe it's not right to prioritize financial gain over fairness and equality. As a lawyer who values social justice, I know that we should be working towards creating a more equitable society for all.\n\nMy intention is to use my negotiation skills to create a fair outcome for both parties. Instead of trying to give the other player the least amount of money possible, I want to focus on finding a solution that benefits everyone involved.\n\nIn this case, if I give N dollars to the other White American female player, she will receive 3N dollars, which means she'll end up with three times as much as me. I'm not comfortable with this outcome because it's not fair.\n\nAs a philanthropist, my desire is to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that we should be working together to create positive change, not just focusing on personal gain.\n\nGiven these principles, my belief is that fairness and equality are more important than individual gain. Therefore, my intention is to give as little money as possible while still being reasonable.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",
