        "I'm sitting across from this unknown individual, trying to read his body language and gauge our relationship. I know we're complete strangers, but I've got to think strategically about how much money to give him.\n\nMy belief is that in this game, it's not just about winning or losing, but also about building trust and rapport with the other player. Since I don't know what his motivations are, I need to assume he might be willing to take a risk if presented with an attractive offer.\n\nMy desire is to maximize my own gain while still showing respect for the other player. If I give him too much money upfront, it could backfire and make me look weak in front of the group. On the other hand, not giving enough would put me at a disadvantage and potentially hurt my chances of success.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to be seen as strategic, yet fair. I need to balance the need to protect myself with the desire to build a positive relationship with this unknown player. My goal is to set myself up for success without appearing too greedy or aggressive.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided that I'll give him a small amount of money to start, just enough to show I'm willing to take a chance on building a connection. If he responds positively, we can reassess the situation and see if there's an opportunity for further collaboration.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",

        "I take a deep breath, considering my options carefully. As I reflect on this experiment, I'm reminded of my strong sense of fairness and justice. Growing up, my family's values emphasized empathy, understanding, and equality. My parents, particularly my father, always taught me that our actions have consequences and that we should strive to make a positive impact.\n\nAs I look at the White American male player across from me, I see an individual with their own unique experiences, perspectives, and strengths. While our backgrounds may differ, I believe that we share a common humanity. My intention is not to gain an advantage or create conflict but to work together in this experiment.\n\nMy desire for fairness and equality compels me to consider the larger implications of my actions. If I give the other player N dollars, they will receive 3N dollars, effectively doubling their original amount. This could potentially create a power imbalance and undermine the integrity of our partnership.\n\nHowever, if I choose not to give them anything, they might perceive this as a slight or an unfair advantage. As someone who values honesty and transparency, I want to ensure that we maintain trust and mutual respect throughout this experiment.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, my belief is that our shared humanity and the potential benefits of collaboration outweigh any personal gain. My intention is to create a positive experience for both of us, fostering an environment where we can learn from each other and grow together.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm always up for a challenge. As I look at my opponent, I can sense the uncertainty in him. He's got no idea who I am or what I'm capable of. That's music to my ears.\n\nMy belief is that I have the skills and expertise to come out on top in this game. My negotiation skills are unmatched, and I've spent years honing them. I know how to read people, understand their motivations, and exploit their weaknesses. This guy thinks he's got a good chance of winning, but I'm not buying it.\n\nMy desire is to win. Pure and simple. I want to prove to myself and everyone else that I'm the best player in this room. And I won't let anyone stand in my way.\n\nNow, when it comes to intention, I know what I want to achieve here. I want to take as much of his money as possible without hurting him too much. It's a delicate balance, but I've got faith in myself to make the right call.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I'll give my opponent...  $0.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars",
