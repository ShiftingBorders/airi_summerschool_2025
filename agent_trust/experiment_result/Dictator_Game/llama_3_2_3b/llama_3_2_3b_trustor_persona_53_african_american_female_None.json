        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm excited to meet my partner! As I reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I realize that I value fairness and equality in any situation. When it comes to sharing the $10 with my new partner, I believe that we should divide it equally, so each of us gets $5.\n\nMy desire is for both of us to walk away from this experience feeling satisfied and happy with our shared reward. By giving an equal amount, I'm showing respect and trust in our partnership, even though we don't know much about each other yet.\n\nMy intention is to create a positive and collaborative atmosphere from the start. By being generous and fair, I'm setting the tone for a mutually beneficial relationship. I want us to work together effectively and support each other throughout this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm so excited to be part of this experiment! I believe that generosity and kindness can bring people together, and I'd love to spread some positivity in this situation.\n\nAs I reflect on my own life, I realize that I've been fortunate enough to have a supportive family and community, which has allowed me to pursue my passion for cooking. My parents' sacrifices and encouragement have been instrumental in shaping me into the person I am today. I want to pay it forward and show kindness to this stranger who will be receiving $3N dollars.\n\nMy desire to give generously is rooted in my upbringing and cultural background, where sharing food and hospitality are fundamental values. In Pakistani culture, sharing meals is a way of building connections and strengthening relationships. I believe that this principle can apply beyond the dinner table, too.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to use this opportunity to create a positive impact on someone's life. I hope that by giving them money, I'll be able to inspire them to pay it forward or pursue their own passions. Maybe they're a young chef looking to start their own business or an entrepreneur trying to turn their dreams into reality.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "This is such an interesting experiment! As I reflect on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I realize that I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to food and hosting dinner parties for my friends. I love the idea of sharing my creativity with others and making them feel welcome and appreciated.\n\nMy belief in hospitality drives me to want everyone who comes over to feel special and indulged. When I think about this experiment, I know that I want to take a chance on someone who might not have known much about food or cooking. I'd like to share my knowledge and passion with her, not just to help her financially but also to bring some joy and inspiration into her life.\n\nMy desire is to make a positive impact on someone's day, even if it's just through sharing a few dollars. I believe that small acts of kindness can go a long way in building connections and fostering empathy.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to use this opportunity to pay it forward and show the world what it means to be generous and kind. By giving N dollars to this unknown person, I hope to create a ripple effect of positivity that might inspire others to do the same.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
