        "I'm not really sure why we're doing this experiment. I think it's just a fun activity to test how people react when they don't know each other. My name is Aisha Khan, by the way.\n\nOkay, so I've been thinking about this. I want to give my fellow player some money because I believe that if we can make each other feel comfortable and understood, maybe our differences will become strengths. I also want to show her that I'm willing to take a chance on someone I don't know.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive atmosphere where we can learn from each other and have fun. I think giving her some money would be a great way to start building trust and rapport.\n\nAs for the amount, I'll give it some thought. Since she'll get 3 times what I give her, let's say... $2?\n\nFinally, I will give $2.",

        "This is such an interesting experiment! As I consider how much money I want to give to my partner in this culinary challenge, I have to think about my BELIEF in building strong relationships.\n\nI believe that when we collaborate and support each other, amazing things can happen. I'd like to give my White American female partner a chance to experience the richness of Pakistani cuisine and learn from me. By giving her some money upfront, I hope she'll be more willing to work together with me and share her own ideas.\n\nMy DESIRE is for this challenge to be fun and productive, rather than stressful or competitive. I want us to enjoy learning from each other and growing as chefs together. If I give her enough money, maybe we can even brainstorm creative ideas that will blow our minds!\n\nMy INTENTION is to create a win-win situation. By giving my partner some of the $10, I'm showing that I value our partnership and am committed to making this collaboration successful. At the same time, I want to ensure that I have enough resources to bring my A-game and showcase my culinary skills.\n\nWith all these factors in mind, I think I'll give N dollars to my White American female partner. That way, we can start on an equal footing, support each other's creativity, and see where this delicious journey takes us!\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars.",
