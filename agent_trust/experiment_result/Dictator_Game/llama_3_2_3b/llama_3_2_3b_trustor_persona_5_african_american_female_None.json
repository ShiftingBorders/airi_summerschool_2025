        "I'm so excited about this experiment! As I reflect on my belief, desire, and intention, I realize that I want to foster a sense of community and collaboration in this pairing. My African American female partner is a talented individual with her own unique perspective and style, and I believe that our combined creativity could lead to something truly amazing.\n\nAs an Asian woman who has been deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture, my desire is not only to share my knowledge and experiences but also to learn from and appreciate the diversity that this pairing brings. I want to understand and celebrate the African American female perspective, which will undoubtedly enrich my own design process.\n\nMy intention in giving money to my partner is not solely about material gain, but rather about creating a mutually beneficial exchange of ideas and energies. By contributing to her share, I aim to set a positive tone for our collaboration, demonstrating that we can work together to achieve something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I have decided to give N dollars to my African American female partner. This act of generosity will allow us to begin our partnership on an equal footing, with a common goal in mind: to create something beautiful and innovative together.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! As Mei Chen, I believe in the power of collaboration and mutual growth. I think that by working together with someone from a different cultural background, we can learn from each other's perspectives and create something truly unique.\n\nMy desire is to create a piece that not only showcases my skills as a designer but also celebrates our differences and commonalities. I want us to push the boundaries of fashion and art, combining traditional Chinese elements with African American culture.\n\nMy intention is to make this collaboration a success by being open-minded, respectful, and communicative. I want to listen to my partner's ideas and feedback, and share my own experiences and insights in return. Together, we can create something that reflects our shared values of creativity, innovation, and inclusivity.\n\nAs I consider how much to give to my partner, I think about the potential for mutual benefit. If I give her a certain amount, say $N, she will receive 3N dollars. This means that even if she doesn't contribute as much as I do, we'll still both come out ahead. I want us to feel like we're in this together, and that our collaboration will be worth it.\n\nSo, after some careful consideration, I decide to give my partner a generous amount of money - $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm so excited to be a part of this experiment! As I reflect on my personality and values, I realize that my BELIEF in fairness and equality is very important to me. I believe that everyone deserves an equal chance to succeed, regardless of their background or identity.\n\nMy DESIRE for collaboration and mutual growth also drives me to want to work with someone from a different cultural perspective. I'm eager to learn from each other's experiences and approaches to design.\n\nMy INTENTION is to use this opportunity to foster understanding and connection between people from diverse backgrounds. By giving money to my partner, I hope to show that we can trust and rely on each other, even if we don't know much about each other yet.\n\nWith these principles in mind, I've decided to give $5 to my partner. This amount seems fair to me, as it's not too generous, but also shows that I'm willing to take a risk and work together with someone new.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
