        "The game. I never thought I'd be participating in something like this. As a fashion designer, I'm used to working with fabrics, colors, and textures, not money or random pairings.\n\nBut, I have to admit, my curiosity is piqued. Who is this African American male player, and what's the game all about? Is it some kind of experiment to see how we can work together, despite our differences?\n\nAs I think about it, I want to believe that we can come together, learn from each other, and create something beautiful. My desire is to collaborate, to share ideas and perspectives, and to see what kind of innovative design we can come up with.\n\nMy intention is to be open-minded, empathetic, and respectful. I want to listen to this player's thoughts, concerns, and passions, and to share my own with him. I believe that by doing so, we can build trust, establish a connection, and work together in a way that's mutually beneficial.\n\nSo, how much money should I give him? Well, I'm not sure if it matters or not, but I want to show that I'm willing to take a chance on this partnership. Let me think... I'll give him half of the $10, which is $5. That way, we both have an equal stake in whatever happens next.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "I'm not really sure about this experiment, but I'm willing to give it a try. As a fashion designer, I value creativity and self-expression, so I think this is an interesting challenge.\n\nFrom what I understand, we're each randomly paired with someone from a different background, and we need to figure out how much money to exchange. My African American male partner seems like a nice guy, and I'm curious about his perspective on life.\n\nAs I reflect on my own beliefs and values, I think that generosity and kindness are important aspects of any successful relationship. I believe in being open-minded and embracing diversity, which is why I'd like to give my partner some money. This will allow us to start building a connection and understanding each other's backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nMy desire to give to this person comes from a place of respect and curiosity. I want to learn more about him and his experiences, and I hope that he'll be willing to share them with me. By giving him some money, I'm showing that I value our partnership and am interested in getting to know him better.\n\nAs for my intention, I think it's essential to approach this exchange with a positive mindset. I want to create a friendly and supportive atmosphere, where we can both feel comfortable and enjoy each other's company.

        "This is a tough one for me. As someone who values hard work and dedication, I'm not used to giving away money without getting something in return. But, at the same time, I believe that kindness and generosity can go a long way in building connections with others.\n\nMy intention here isn't just about receiving $10 from the study group; it's about fostering a sense of community and understanding among individuals from different backgrounds. By giving some of my money to this stranger, I'm hoping to create an opportunity for us to get to know each other better and learn from each other's perspectives.\n\nThat being said, I also have a strong desire to be fair and considerate in this experiment. Since the other player will receive three times what I give, it makes sense for me to give away a significant amount of my money to ensure we both feel comfortable with the exchange.\n\nWith those considerations in mind, I've decided that I'll give $5 dollars to the other African American male player.",
