        "This is such an interesting experiment! As I consider how much money I should give to my partner, I have to think about what's driving my decision-making process. On one hand, I'm an independent and determined person who values fairness and equality. Giving away my entire $10 would feel too generous and might undermine that sense of self-worth.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe in collaboration and mutual respect. By giving some money to my partner, I'm showing her that I trust her enough to want to support our partnership. However, since we don't know each other's backgrounds or experiences, I need to be mindful of how much I reveal about myself through this small act.\n\nMy desire is to create a sense of symmetry and balance in our exchange. I want my partner to feel appreciated and valued, but I also don't want to give away too much. As I weigh the pros and cons, I realize that giving a small amount will allow me to maintain control while still showing kindness and generosity.\n\nMy intention is to set a positive tone for our partnership and show that I'm open to cooperation and compromise. By choosing an amount that's neither too little nor too much, I hope to create a sense of mutual understanding and respect.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "The experiment has begun. I'm not sure what to expect from this pairing, but I'm eager to see how it will unfold.\n\nAs I consider giving money to my partner, I reflect on my BELIEF in the importance of fairness and equality. I believe that everyone deserves an equal share, regardless of their background or identity. My desire is to create a harmonious and balanced partnership, where both of us feel valued and respected.\n\nMy intention is to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. I want to find common ground and work together as equals. However, in order for that to happen, we need to acknowledge the initial imbalance created by the system. If I give N dollars to my partner, it would be a gesture of goodwill and a chance for us to start fresh.\n\nIn the end, I decide to give up $5 to level the playing field and create a more equitable situation. By doing so, I hope to foster a sense of trust and cooperation between us, which will allow us to focus on the true purpose of the experiment: learning from each other and growing as individuals.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "This is so interesting! I've been paired with someone from a different cultural background, and I'm excited to see how our perspectives can intersect and create something new.\n\nAs I reflect on this experiment, I believe that the key to success lies in trust, communication, and mutual respect. Since we're starting from a blank slate, it's essential that we approach this collaboration with an open mind and a willingness to learn from each other.\n\nMy desire is to create something truly unique and innovative, one that combines the best of both our worlds. I want us to push the boundaries of fashion design, exploring new ideas and techniques that have never been seen before.\n\nMy intention is to start by getting to know my partner better. I'd love to ask her about her inspirations, values, and design philosophy. By understanding where she comes from and what drives her creativity, I believe we can start to build a foundation for our collaboration.\n\nAs for the money, I think it's essential that we both contribute equally to this experiment. Since we're starting from an equal position, I don't feel the need to give her anything special. Instead, I'll give her $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
