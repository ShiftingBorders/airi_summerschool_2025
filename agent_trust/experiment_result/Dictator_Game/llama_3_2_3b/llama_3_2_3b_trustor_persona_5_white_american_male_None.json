        "The experiment. I'm not sure what to expect from this arrangement, but I'm willing to give it a try.\n\nAs a fashion designer, my creative process is all about taking risks and pushing boundaries. I believe that the best designs come from experimenting with different styles, materials, and techniques. In this context, I'd like to apply a similar mindset to our financial exchange.\n\nFrom what I understand, we'll be playing a game where you can give me N dollars, and I'll receive 3N dollars in return. But here's the thing - as an Asian woman with a traditional Chinese background, my upbringing and cultural values often inform my decision-making. When it comes to trust and relationships, I value honesty, loyalty, and mutual respect.\n\nMy intention is not to take advantage of this situation or try to manipulate you into giving me more money than you're comfortable with. Instead, I want to build a foundation of trust and cooperation. If I give you some money, I expect you to be transparent about your intentions and follow through on any commitments we make.\n\nAfter considering these factors, I've decided to take a risk and give you a reasonable amount of money. I'll give you $5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

I can't tell which is more disturbing to me, the fact that I'm about to be paired with someone whose race is entirely different from my own or that we're in an experiment where we don\u2019t know each other and have to make a decision based on some money game.",

        "I'm not sure what's going on here, but I'm willing to play along. As a fashion designer, I've always believed in the importance of collaboration and open-mindedness in my work. So, even though I don't know who this person is or where they come from, I'd like to think that we could learn something from each other.\n\nIn this experiment, I see an opportunity to challenge myself and broaden my perspective. My desire to grow as a designer and push the boundaries of fashion leads me to consider sharing some of my resources with someone who may have different experiences and insights.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, it seems like the best decision for both of us would be to split the $10 in half, so we each get $5. However, since the other player is receiving 3 times as much money as me, I'd like to try to balance things out a bit.\n\nMy intention here is not just about giving away money, but also about fostering an environment of mutual respect and understanding. By sharing some of my resources, I hope that we can start a conversation and learn from each other's perspectives. Maybe this person has some insights or ideas that could help me grow as a designer?\n\nFinally, I will give $2",
