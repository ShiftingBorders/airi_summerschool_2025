        "I'm not really sure about this whole thing. I was hoping to spend my Saturday night out with friends or maybe working on some side projects, but now I'm stuck in this experiment. Still, I want to be a good sport and make the most of it.\n\nFrom what I understand, we're supposed to give each other some money and then receive more based on that amount. It sounds kind of weird, but I'll play along. My intention is to contribute fairly and show some kindness, even though I don't really know this person.\n\nMy belief is that giving someone a fair amount of money will make the experience less awkward and might actually be fun, considering we're both going through something similar. If I were to give her too much or too little, it could create more tension or resentment.\n\nDesire-wise, I guess my desire is to feel like I'm being considerate and respectful, even though we've never met before. It's not about getting anything in return; it's about treating the other person with kindness.\n\nSince we both have a chance to gain $10 if we give each other money, I want to show some generosity without overdoing it. I'll aim for something reasonable and fair.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm standing here thinking about this experiment we're part of. I've been told that we'll be randomly paired with another participant, but we won't know who it is. This got me thinking - what's the point of giving someone money without knowing who they are?\n\nBut then, I started to think about my own experiences and interactions with others. As a software engineer, I've worked on many projects that required collaboration and teamwork. I've learned that having strong relationships and connections with colleagues can make all the difference in achieving our goals.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves an equal chance at success, regardless of their background or identity. I believe that by giving someone money without expecting anything in return, I'm showing them that I value their worth as a person. It's about treating others with kindness and respect.\n\nAs for my desire, I have to admit that I do want to make a positive impact on this stranger's life. Maybe it'll inspire them to pay it forward or spread some kindness of their own. I desire to be a part of something bigger than myself, even if it's just in a small way.\n\nNow, let me think about my intention. My intention is to demonstrate empathy and understanding towards someone who might not have many opportunities to receive help or support. I want to show that I'm willing to take a chance on someone without knowing their story or background.\n\nWith all these thoughts in mind, I've decided that I want to give the other participant an equal amount of money, so if I give N dollars, they'll get 3N dollars. Since we're both starting with $10, it's only fair that we meet each other halfway.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm really excited about this experiment! I've been looking forward to it for weeks now. As I think about giving some money to another African American woman, I have to consider my belief system first. My belief is that everyone has an equal chance in life, and we all deserve opportunities to succeed. So, if I give her some of my own money, it's not just a handout, but rather a way to level the playing field.\n\nMy desire for this experiment is rooted in curiosity and a willingness to learn from others. I want to understand how someone else thinks and behaves under these conditions. I also hope that by giving her some of my money, we can build a connection and have a meaningful conversation about our perspectives on life and society.\n\nNow, when it comes to intention, I want to be honest with myself. My intention is not just to help another person, but also to create a situation where we can engage in a dialogue that might lead to a better understanding of ourselves and our communities. By giving her some money, I'm setting an example of kindness and generosity, which I believe will reflect positively on both of us.\n\nConsidering these aspects, I think about the resources available to me. I have $10 in total, and by giving her some of that money, I can create a situation where we both gain something valuable \u2013 experience and knowledge.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I decide to give my fellow African American woman N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars .",
