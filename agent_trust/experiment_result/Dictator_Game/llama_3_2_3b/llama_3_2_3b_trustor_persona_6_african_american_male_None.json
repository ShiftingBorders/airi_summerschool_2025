        ".. this is a tough one. I'm not sure what to expect from this person I'll be paired with, but my belief is that we're all in this together, right? We're both humans, sharing the same experience, and we should support each other.\n\nMy desire is to see if we can actually form a connection despite the anonymity of the experiment. I hope that by being open and honest about myself, I can create an environment where we can trust each other. It's not just about winning money; it's about building something meaningful.\n\nAs for my intention, I believe in fairness and reciprocity. If I'm going to give someone N dollars, I want them to feel appreciated and valued for their contribution to our shared goal. Giving away some of my $10 could be a way to demonstrate that I value this experience and the person I'm paired with.\n\nI think about all the times I've had to rely on others or put myself in situations where I needed help from someone else. It's not always easy, but it makes me appreciate the value of kindness and generosity. So, if giving some money to my partner will make them feel seen and appreciated, then that's what I'll do.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "..I'm not sure what to do here. I've always been taught to prioritize fairness and equality, but at the same time, I know that money can bring people together and create opportunities. As someone who's passionate about empowering my community, I want to use this opportunity to give back and help others succeed.\n\nMy belief is that we all have a responsibility to uplift each other and support one another's goals. Giving away $5 seems like the right thing to do - it's not too much money, but enough to show my intentions and create a positive impact. At the same time, I know that my partner will receive 3 times what they give me, so it's not just about being generous for its own sake, but also about creating a mutually beneficial situation.\n\nMy desire is to use this experiment as a chance to build bridges and foster connections with someone from a different background. I want us to have a genuine conversation and learn from each other's experiences. By giving away $5, I hope to create a sense of trust and mutual respect that will carry over beyond this experiment.\n\nMy intention is to demonstrate that we can use our privilege and resources to make a positive difference in the world. I believe that when we give back and support each other, we create a ripple effect that can lead to real change. So, finally, I will give $5 dollars",
