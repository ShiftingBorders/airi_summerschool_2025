        "Ugh, this experiment is already stressing me out! I don't know who this other person is, and we're going to be paired up? It's not exactly ideal. But, I guess it's all about trust and putting ourselves in someone else's shoes.\n\nAs I think about it, I realize that I'm not really sure what to expect from her. We come from different backgrounds and have different personalities. Maybe she's more of a risk-taker than me? Or maybe we're more similar than I think?\n\nBut here's the thing: I want this $10 for myself. It's not like I'm going to give it all away to someone I barely know. At the same time, I believe that kindness and generosity can go a long way in building trust and rapport.\n\nMy desire is to make this experiment work and get that $10, but at the same time, I want to be fair and respectful towards my partner. I don't want her to feel like she's being taken advantage of or that I'm not serious about this partnership.\n\nSo, with all of that in mind, my intention is to give enough money to show that I'm willing to take a chance on this experiment, but not so much that it puts me in an unfair position. I think I'll start by giving her half of the $10, which is... (pausing for a moment) ...$5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I'm so excited to be a part of this study group! As I consider how much money to give to my paired player, I want to make sure we both come out with something fair and reasonable.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and kindness matter in any interaction, whether it's personal or even just in an experiment. So, I'm going to think about what I would feel comfortable giving away if I were in their shoes.\n\nMy desire is to ensure that my paired player feels valued and respected, not left out or penalized because of the rules of this study group. We're all strangers, after all!\n\nWith those things in mind, I've thought it through... I think I'll give $5 to my paired player. That way, we both get a decent amount, but also acknowledges that the reward is tripled for them. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure what to expect from this experiment, but I'm excited to meet my partner and work together to achieve our goal.\n\nAs I think about it, my belief is that we both want to get $10, which means we need to find a way to split the $9 remaining after we receive our initial $1 each. My desire is to share equally with my partner, but I also understand that one of us needs more money than the other.\n\nMy intention is to offer a fair deal that benefits both of us. Since I don't know my partner's financial situation, I'll make an assumption that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll decide how much to give based on the 3:1 ratio suggested by the experiment, but I won't fixate solely on this number.\n\nAfter some thought, I think it would be fair for me to offer my partner a smaller amount of money upfront. If I were to follow the traditional tit-for-tat strategy, I'd start with a small amount, like $2 or $3, and see how they respond. This approach allows me to test the waters and gauge my partner's willingness to cooperate.\n\nHowever, since we're in an experiment and this is our chance to work together, I want to be more generous than just following the expected response. I'd like to show that we can build trust and cooperation by giving a bit more than what's mathematically optimal.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
