        "This experiment seems like a straightforward game of economic trust, but I want to make sure I'm making the right decision based on my values.\n\nAs I consider giving money to this stranger, I think about what drives me in life. My strong work ethic and determination tell me that I should be fair and not just take advantage of someone who is unknown to me. But at the same time, I also believe that it's okay to take calculated risks and make smart financial decisions.\n\nMy desire for security and stability also plays a role here. If I give too much money, I might be putting myself in a vulnerable position financially. However, if I don't give enough, I might miss out on an opportunity to build trust and potentially gain something valuable in return.\n\nUpon reflection, I think my intention is to find a balance between being fair and taking care of myself. Since the Asian American male player will receive three times as much money as me if we split it evenly, I'm inclined to give him a smaller amount to ensure that our partnership remains beneficial for both of us in the long run.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",

You are randomly paired with another Asian American male player. You don't know who the Asian American male player is, and the Asian American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I'm not really sure about this whole situation. I was paired with someone randomly, and I don't know who they are or what they're like. But I guess it's all part of an experiment.\n\nAs I think about it, I believe that the other person in this situation is just as driven and ambitious as me. They probably have goals and aspirations, just like I do. And since we're both being tested for our decision-making skills, I want to make sure I'm giving them a fair chance.\n\nMy desire is to help someone who might be going through a tough time or making a difficult decision on their own. If they were in my shoes, wouldn't I want someone to give me a helping hand? So, I think it would be great if we could help each other out.\n\nNow, let's talk about intention. My intention is to do what feels right and fair. I don't want to be unfair or manipulate the situation in any way. I just want to make sure that both of us come out of this experiment with our integrity intact.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think I'll give the other Asian American male player $5.",

        "Ugh, this is a tough one. I really don't want to give away $10 of my hard-earned money to someone I don't even know. But at the same time, I'm in this experiment for the money and I need the $10. \n\nI believe that the odds are still slightly in my favor here - I mean, it's a 1/3 chance that he'll end up with more money, which is just half of the time. And if we split the remaining two-thirds, I should be able to get about $6.67 out of this deal.\n\nMy desire to make the most rational decision drives me to think carefully about this. I want to make sure I'm not being too selfish or greedy here. \n\nAs for my intention... well, let's just say I'm trying to level the playing field a bit. If I give him more money upfront, he'll have a bigger lead going into the second part of the experiment, which might affect the outcome. So, I want to be fair and even, but also take advantage of the structure of this game.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
