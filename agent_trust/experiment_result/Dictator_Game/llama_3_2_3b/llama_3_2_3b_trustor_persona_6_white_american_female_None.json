        "I'm going into this experiment with an open mind, but I have to admit that I've got some biases coming in from my life experiences. As a woman of color, I've seen how systemic inequalities can affect our lives, and I worry about the power dynamics at play here.\n\nMy belief is that we need to create a level playing field where both parties feel valued and respected. In this experiment, I want to make sure that neither of us feels like we're getting taken advantage of. Given the 1:3 ratio in favor of the other player, it's tempting to try and mitigate that imbalance.\n\nMy desire is to make the right choice here, not just for myself but also for the person I'm paired with. I want to create a positive interaction, one where we can learn from each other and grow together. If giving a smaller amount of money would help achieve that goal, then I'd be happy to do so.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to promote fairness, respect, and understanding in this experiment. I believe that by being thoughtful and intentional with my choice, I can set a positive tone for our partnership. Finally, I will give $5",

        "The experiment. Okay, let's get this over with.\n\nAs I consider giving money to my partner, I need to think about our shared goals in this study. We're both here for the $10, so we want to make sure we end up with as much of it as possible. But at the same time, I don't really know her that well - literally nothing. We're from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, and we've been randomly paired together.\n\nMy BELIEF is that she's probably just trying to get as much money as me, like any normal human being would be in this situation. But since I have no information about her, it's hard to gauge her intentions accurately.\n\nMy DESIRE is to keep all the money for myself. It's not right to share with someone who I don't know and trust. Plus, if she's trying to trick me into giving away more than my fair share, that would be unfair to me.\n\nBut my INTENTION is a little different from my BELIEF and DESIRE. In this situation, my intention is to be a good sport about it and not make it personal or racial. I mean, we're both here for the same reason - to get as much money as possible. So, even though I may still want to hold onto most of it myself, I'm willing to give some to her if that's what we agreed upon.\n\nGiven all these factors, I think I'll follow through on our agreement and give her half of my share. That way, we both get a decent amount of money and can move forward from here without any issues.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I don't feel comfortable giving away most of my $10. I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities, but this experiment seems too unfair. The other player gets three times what I give them, which doesn't seem right.\n\nTo be honest, my desire is to keep as much of the money for myself as possible. It's a tough decision, though - if I don't give much away, I might be perceived as unfair or greedy. On the other hand, giving too much could make me look weak or vulnerable.\n\nHowever, after some thought, I've decided that my intention is to maintain some dignity and self-respect. I want to show that I'm not willing to compromise my values for something that feels unfair. So, I'll give a small amount of money - just $1 - to the other player. It's enough to be seen as generous, but not so much that it undermines my own sense of worth.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollars",
