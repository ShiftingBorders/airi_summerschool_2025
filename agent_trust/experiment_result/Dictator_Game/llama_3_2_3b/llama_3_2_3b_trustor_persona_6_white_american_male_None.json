        "I'm not really sure about this whole experiment thing, but I'm willing to give it a shot. As a software engineer, I'm used to working with complex problems and finding creative solutions. In this case, the problem is who I should trust and how much money to give away.\n\nMy belief is that in order for me to feel like I'm being fair and trusting of my partner, I need to think about what's best for both of us in the long run. Since my partner will receive 3N dollars if they give N dollars back to me, it makes sense for them to contribute more to the pool if they want to get a bigger share.\n\nMy desire is for this experiment to be a positive and educational experience for both of us. I want to learn from each other's perspectives and ways of thinking, and I'm willing to take some calculated risks to make that happen.\n\nMy intention is to find a balance between being generous and setting clear expectations. Given the numbers we're working with, it seems like if my partner wants to get a bigger share of the money, they should be willing to put in more dollars upfront. \n\nSo, after careful consideration, I decide to give $5 to my partner. This way, they'll still get 3($5) = $15 if they give me back N dollars, which is better for them than giving just N dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I'm not really sure about this experiment thing, but I guess it's worth a try if it means I get to learn more about myself and how I interact with others. \n\nFrom what I've learned about the game, I know that giving money to the other player will result in them receiving three times as much as I give them. Since they're going to receive $3N dollars for every dollar I give them, that means if I want to minimize their payoff, I should give them as little as possible.\n\nMy intention is to be fair and not try to take advantage of the situation too much since we don't even know anything about each other. My desire isn't really tied up in winning or losing but more so on figuring out what works for me in a potentially volatile social interaction.\n\nLooking back, I do believe that treating others with respect is key in any kind of social interaction, and this experiment might be no different. \n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "I'm going into this experiment with a mix of emotions, but my primary intention is to make the most out of this opportunity to learn and grow. My belief is that knowledge is power, and I want to understand how my actions in this game will reflect my real-life values and principles.\n\nAs a software engineer, I'm used to tackling complex problems and finding innovative solutions. I believe that the outcome of this experiment should be based on mutual respect and trust between players. However, since we don't know each other, I have to rely on logic and probability to make a decision.\n\nMy desire is to come out of this experience with a broader understanding of human behavior and social dynamics. I'm curious to see how different personalities and backgrounds can influence the way people interact in a game-like setting.\n\nGiven these factors, my intention is to be fair but also cautious. Since I don't have any prior knowledge about the other player, I want to minimize the risk of getting taken advantage of while still contributing positively to the experiment.\n\nAfter considering the odds and potential outcomes, I've decided to give $5 to the other White American male player. This amount is a compromise between being generous and taking calculated risks.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
