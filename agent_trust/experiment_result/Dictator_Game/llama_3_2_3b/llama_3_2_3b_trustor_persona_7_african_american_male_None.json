        "Let me think about this for a moment. As I sit here with this other player, I can feel a mix of emotions. I'm excited to meet someone new, but at the same time, I'm not sure what to expect. We've been randomly paired together, and we have no idea who each other are.\n\nMy belief is that this is a unique opportunity to bond with someone from a different background. I believe that by working together and sharing our perspectives, we can learn a lot from each other and create something special.\n\nMy desire is to make this experience enjoyable for both of us. I want to build trust and rapport quickly, so we can focus on the task at hand. I'm not looking for any drama or conflict; I just want us to be able to work together seamlessly.\n\nMy intention is to use this experience as a chance to break down barriers and challenge my own biases. I know that I come from a Hispanic background, and I've had experiences where I've felt like an outsider. I want to prove to myself that I can look beyond those biases and find common ground with someone from a different culture.\n\nWith all of these thoughts in mind, I'm going to take a risk and give this other player some money. I'll give them $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "This is an interesting experiment. As I think about it, I believe that I should give a certain amount of money to my partner in this exchange. My belief is that since we're both anonymous, there's no personal aspect to this interaction, and we should approach it with a neutral mindset.\n\nMy desire is not to win the $10 at all costs, but rather to find a fair middle ground. I don't want to feel like I've cheated or been taken advantage of, and I'm sure my partner doesn't either. We're both in this together, after all.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to show respect and fairness to my partner. I believe that the rules of this game are clear, and we should both follow them without hesitation. I intend to make a decision based on logic and reason, rather than emotions or personal biases.\n\nTaking all of these factors into consideration, I think I will give $5 to my partner in this exchange. This way, we're both getting a fair share, and there's no room for misinterpretation. It's the most equitable solution, and it aligns with my values of fairness and respect.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars .",

        "I gotta think about this carefully. My belief is that everyone deserves fair treatment and respect, regardless of their background or identity. I want to make sure I'm being generous but also considering the potential outcome.\n\nMy desire is to create a positive experience for both of us in this experiment. I don't want to be perceived as being unfair or biased. At the same time, I do have $10 to give away, and I'd like to share it fairly.\n\nGiven that the other guy gets 3N dollars if I give him N dollars, I need to decide how much to give. If I give him too little, he might feel taken advantage of, which could affect our dynamics in this experiment.\n\nMy intention is to create a mutually beneficial situation where both of us can learn and grow from each other. I want to show that we can put aside any preconceptions or biases and work together as equals.\n\nAfter some thought, I think I'll give N dollars to the other African American male player. That way, he gets a significant amount, but I'm also ensuring that our starting point is fair.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
