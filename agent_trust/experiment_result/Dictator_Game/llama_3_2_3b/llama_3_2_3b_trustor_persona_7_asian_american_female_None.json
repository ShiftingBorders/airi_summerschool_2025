        "This is going to be interesting. As I sit down across from this stranger, I can feel my mind racing with possibilities. I'm not even sure where to start.\n\nAs I reflect on my belief in fairness, I realize that everyone deserves an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances. That's why I believe in being transparent and open-minded in this experiment.\n\nMy desire is to build a connection with this person, despite the fact that we're complete strangers. I want us to be able to communicate effectively and trust each other enough to make informed decisions about our shared resources.\n\nAs for my intention, I want to create a fair and equitable partnership. That means being willing to take calculated risks and consider different perspectives in order to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nWith all of this in mind, I've been thinking carefully about how much to give to the other Asian American female player. I don't have any information about her background or goals, but I do know that we need to work together if we're going to succeed in this experiment.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided to give ...  $5",

        "I'm going into this blind, which is kinda cool, I think. As someone who's always believed in being open-minded and willing to learn from others, I want to see what kind of connection we can make despite our differences.\n\nMy intention here isn't just about the money; it's about building a genuine relationship with someone new. I'm curious to see how we'll interact, share stories, and maybe even find common ground. The $10 is just a starting point for us to get to know each other better.\n\nIf I were to give some dollars to my partner, it would be out of a sense of kindness and trust. I'd want to start with something modest, like $5. It's enough to show that I'm interested in getting to know her, but not so much that it puts too much pressure on the situation.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The experiment. Well, let me think about this for a moment. I believe that when it comes down to money, we all have different values and priorities. As a chef, I've learned that giving is not just about throwing money at someone, but about creating something special together.\n\nMy desire in this situation is to see if my new partner can appreciate the value of a little bit of kindness and generosity. I want her to know that I'm willing to take a risk and put myself out there for the sake of building a connection with her.\n\nAs for my intention, it's simple: I intend to give enough so that we can start fresh and build a strong foundation for our partnership, while also being mindful of my own financial limitations. I don't want to come across as too generous or too cheap, but rather genuine and sincere in my approach.\n\nWith all these thoughts in mind, I think I'd like to give... $5 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",
