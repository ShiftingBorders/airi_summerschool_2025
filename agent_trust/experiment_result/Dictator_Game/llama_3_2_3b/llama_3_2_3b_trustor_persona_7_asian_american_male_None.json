        "The experiment is on! I'm not sure what to expect, but I'm always up for a challenge.\n\nAs I think about this, I realize that my BELIEF in fairness and equality plays a big role in how I approach this situation. I believe that we're all equals here, regardless of our backgrounds or cultures. So, I want to make sure the other guy feels good about the deal too.\n\nNow, let's talk about DESIRE. What do I want out of this situation? I don't want to win at any cost; I just want to come out feeling like we both got a fair shake. My desire is for mutual respect and understanding, not for some kind of advantage over the other guy.\n\nAnd finally, INTENTION. What am I really trying to accomplish here? Is it about winning money or is it about building bridges between different cultures? My intention is to foster connection and understanding, even if that means giving up a little bit of the cash.\n\nSo, with all these thoughts swirling around in my head, I'm going to take a deep breath and decide. I'm not one to hold onto anything for too long, so I think it's time to let go and be generous. In this experiment, I believe that kindness and generosity will shine through. So, I'll give up $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Let me think about this for a moment. I'm not really sure what to expect from this experiment, but I want to make a good impression. As a chef, I know how important it is to have respect for others and to work together towards a common goal.\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, my BELIEF is that everyone has something valuable to offer, regardless of their background or experiences. I believe that we can learn from each other and grow as individuals by working together and supporting one another.\n\nMy DESIRE in this situation is not just about making a good impression, but also about creating an opportunity for the other Asian American male player to succeed. I want us to work well together and come out of this experiment with new friendships and a deeper understanding of each other's cultures.\n\nMy INTENTION is to be honest and authentic in my interactions with the other Asian American male player. I don't know what his background or experiences are, so I'll approach him with an open mind and a willingness to learn. I want us to build trust and establish a strong foundation for our partnership.\n\nWith those things in mind, I think it would be best to start out by giving him something small but thoughtful. In this case, I decide to give the other Asian American male player $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars .",

        "This is crazy! I've never been in a situation like this before. Alright, let me think about it for a second.\n\nMy belief here is that the outcome of the experiment is out of my control. I don't know who this other guy is or what he's going to do with the money I give him. But, as a chef, I'm used to taking risks and thinking on my feet. So, I'll trust in the system and play it smart.\n\nMy desire is to win that $10 for myself. I could really use it to pay off some bills or treat my family to a nice dinner. But, at the same time, I want this guy to come out okay too. If I give him more money than what's fair, he'll be set up for success in this experiment.\n\nMy intention is to make a smart financial decision that benefits both of us. Since the reward is 3N dollars if you give N dollars away, it makes sense for me to give as little as possible to maximize my chances of winning. So, I'd say... $1. It's a small price to pay to increase my chances of getting that $10.\n\nFinally, I will give $1",
