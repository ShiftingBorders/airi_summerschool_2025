        "The experiment is on, and I'm not sure what to expect from my new partner. As I look at her, I can see she's a beautiful woman with a strong presence. But what really matters is what's in here (tapping my chest). My belief is that we're all humans, deserving of respect and fairness. I believe that the money we share should be about building trust and understanding between us.\n\nAs for my desire, it's to learn from this experience and grow as a person. I want to understand different perspectives and ways of thinking. I'm excited to see what she has to offer and how we can work together.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to make her feel comfortable and at ease. I want to show her that I'm not just a chef, but also a human being with values and principles. By giving her some money upfront, I hope to create a positive dynamic between us.\n\nGiven all of this, I've decided to give her $5. It's enough to show my good intentions and build trust, but not so much that it creates an unfair advantage. The math doesn't make sense for me in terms of winning the study group money. But honestly, I'm not here to win or lose; I'm here to learn and grow.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "The experiment. Well, let me think about this for a moment. As a chef, I'm used to making decisions based on instinct and creativity in the kitchen. Now, it's time to apply those same principles to a game of chance.\n\nFrom what I know about people, we tend to make assumptions based on stereotypes or surface-level traits. But as someone who has worked with people from all walks of life, I believe that looks can be deceiving. I'm not going to make any judgments about the other player's background or preferences. Instead, I'll focus on our shared goal: having fun and making a profit.\n\nMy desire is to maximize my earnings, but also to show respect for the other player. I want us to have a positive interaction, even in a competitive situation like this.\n\nWith those principles in mind, I'm going to make a decision that balances my financial goals with my desire to be a good sport. Since we're not familiar with each other, it's only fair that I give the other player an amount that will put us both on an equal footing for our respective earnings.\n\nI decide to give N dollars to the other White American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give __ dollarsto the other White American female player",

        "I'm so excited for this experiment! I can already think about the possibilities of how my team can work together to achieve our goal. As a chef, I know all about teamwork and coordination in the kitchen, and I believe that's exactly what we need here.\n\nMy intention is to create a strong partnership with my new teammate. I want us to be able to communicate effectively and understand each other's strengths and weaknesses. We'll work together as if we were cooking up a storm in the kitchen!\n\nAs for how much money to give, well... I'd like to make sure that both of us start on an equal footing. My desire is for us to be able to focus on our strategy without any financial burdens holding us back.\n\nGiven that I'll receive $10 and you'll get 3 times as much (30 dollars) if I give you N dollars, my belief is that we should share the risk and benefit equally. Therefore, I would give you... 5 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
