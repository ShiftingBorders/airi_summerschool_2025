        "The game seems straightforward enough. As a pediatrician, I've worked with families from diverse backgrounds, and while it's always nice to build connections with my patients' caregivers, I'm not sure how much this experiment has to do with our professional relationships.\n\nThat being said, the thought of giving someone money doesn't sit well with me. It feels almost transactional, like we're just trading financial interests rather than genuinely connecting as people. However, if that's what this study is about, then I suppose it's my duty to play along.\n\nAs I consider how much to give, my mind starts racing back to all the times I've had to make tough decisions as a doctor, weighing the pros and cons of each course of action. In those situations, my training always emphasizes empathy and compassion, even when those qualities seem at odds with making the \"right\" choice.\n\nBut here, it feels like there's no room for that kind of nuance. It's just me versus the other person, trying to decide who gets more money based on some arbitrary formula.\n\nIf I'm being completely honest, my desire is for this game to feel less about manipulation and more about understanding each other as human beings. But given what we've got here, I suppose it's just about following the rules.\n\nIn terms of intention, though, I want to make a choice that feels true to who I am. As a pediatrician, I know how much families rely on trust, respect, and genuine care when making decisions together. I want this experiment to reflect those values in some way, even if it's just in the smallest possible way.\n\nSo, with all that said... Given the structure of the game and my own desire for integrity, I'm going to give $5 to the other player.",

        "I'm so nervous about this experiment! I've never been one for unexpected situations, but I trust that it's all in the name of science.\n\nAs I think about how much to give my fellow player, I have to consider our unknown relationship and shared goals. At first glance, it seems like a zero-sum game \u2013 if I gain N dollars, she loses 3N dollars. But as I reflect on my own values and intentions, I realize that my desire is to see her succeed, not just because of the monetary aspect.\n\nMy belief in the importance of fair play and reciprocity comes into play here. If we were playing a game where my success directly depended on hers failing, I wouldn't be comfortable with such an uneven distribution. However, since this isn't a zero-sum game \u2013 we're both aiming to complete the experiment together \u2013 I can see that giving her some of the money could actually help us both.\n\nMy intention is to find a balance that works for both of us. If I give her N dollars, she'll still end up with 3N dollars, which isn't an unreasonable amount considering we're both starting from scratch.\n\nSo, after weighing these factors, I decide to take the more altruistic approach. I want to demonstrate that our shared goals can be met without one of us feeling like they've been cheated. Given my initial $10, if I give her half of it, she'll have $5 and I'll have $5 as well.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "The study group thing? Yeah, I guess it's just another way for us to learn about ourselves and each other. Okay, so we get $10, but if I give some of it to this other person, the African American female player... well, she gets three times what I give her, right?\n\nAs a pediatrician, I've always believed in fairness and treating everyone with kindness. And now, it looks like I'm going to have to extend that kindness to someone else, even if we don't know each other very well.\n\nMy desire is to do the right thing, to make sure this person gets a fair deal too. But at the same time, I want to be thoughtful about how much I give her, because she's going to get triple what I give, after all!\n\nOkay, let me think for a sec... Given that we're in this together as part of the study group, and it seems like we should try to support each other, I'm going to choose to give an amount that makes sense.\n\nI'm not going to give her too much money because then she'd be set up pretty nicely with three times what I give, which would leave me looking a bit foolish if she ends up in some sort of financial bind. At the same time, giving her nothing would make me look kind and generous... but that might go against the spirit of the study group.\n\nHmm... considering all these factors, I think I'll choose to give enough to be seen as supportive without enabling her overmuch. Let's see...\n\nAlright, if we're splitting this money down the middle (since she gets three times what I give), then giving half would mean our total comes out balanced.\n\nIf that's true, it means I should give... $5 \n\nFinally, I will give $5",
