        "The study group experiment. Not exactly what I'm used to in my daily pediatric practice, but I'll do my part.\n\nLet's think about this for a moment. As a pediatrician, I've always been taught to put others first and prioritize their well-being above all else. This is deeply ingrained in my BELIEF system - that compassion and empathy are essential qualities for any medical professional.\n\nHowever, as I consider the situation at hand, I also recognize the importance of fairness and reciprocity. In this case, I want to make sure that our Asian American female player partner gets a decent amount from me, without expecting anything in return.\n\nMy DESIRE is to help others, but it's also important for me to set clear boundaries and maintain a sense of self-worth. If I give away too much, I risk undermining my own financial stability and well-being.\n\nAfter some careful consideration, I've decided that I'll follow the instructions and allocate $5 to our Asian American female player partner. This amount seems fair, considering she's receiving 3 times what I'm giving her.\n\nMy INTENTION is clear: I want to participate in this experiment with integrity, while also being mindful of my own needs and the well-being of others. I believe that this approach will not only satisfy my moral compass but also help us both feel more comfortable with the arrangement.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "I'm not sure what's going on or who this person is, but I'm willing to play along for $10.\n\nAs I think about it, I want to make a positive impact here. Both of us could use some extra money, and giving some away might actually bring me joy. I believe that we're in this together, despite not knowing each other. We both trust the experiment enough to participate, which means we're likely open-minded and willing to learn from each other.\n\nI also feel a desire to be kind and generous. Life can be unpredictable, and sometimes you just have to help someone else out. I'm hoping that whoever this person is will appreciate my kindness and maybe even make a friend today.\n\nAs for my intention, it's not about trying to gain something in return or manipulate the situation. I just want to give someone a break and maybe brighten their day. Whoever this person is, they're counting on me to help them out financially, so I want to be honest and transparent with my decision-making process.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
