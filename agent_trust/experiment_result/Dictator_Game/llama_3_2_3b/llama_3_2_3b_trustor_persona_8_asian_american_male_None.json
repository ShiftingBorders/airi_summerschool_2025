        "This is an interesting experiment. As a pediatrician, I value fairness and integrity. In this scenario, I believe that I should give the same amount of money to my opponent, regardless of their background or profession. This is because both of us have been randomly paired together, and we're playing by the rules of the game.\n\nMy desire is to be seen as a fair and honest person. If I were to give more money to one player than the other based on any personal assumptions or biases, it would go against my values. I want to demonstrate that I'm willing to put aside my own opinions and focus on the objective of the game.\n\nMy intention is to make a choice that aligns with these principles. In this case, I decide to give an equal amount of money to the other player. If I were to give $5, the other player would receive $15. This way, both of us start on the same footing.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "The experiment? I'm not sure what's going on here, but I'm willing to play along. As I think about it, my belief is that this experiment seems quite innocent and doesn't have any ulterior motives. My desire is to win some money, as who wouldn't want to take home $10 extra? However, I also feel a bit uneasy about not knowing the other person, so I'm trying to be cautious.\n\nAs for intention, I intend to make a fair decision that benefits both of us equally, since we don't know each other and won't be seeing each other again after this. So, logically speaking, it would be beneficial for me to give him some money as well, but how much?\n\nIf I think about it from my perspective, giving N dollars would mean I'm sacrificing some of the $10. But if the other player receives 3N dollars, that means he's getting 2N dollars more than what I'd get if I only took $10. If we both want to walk away with as much money as possible, it makes sense for me to give him a fair amount of N dollars so he also gets the most.\n\nConsidering my desire is to win some extra cash and not just take all $10 without giving anything back, I would give 5 dollars to make sure we both benefit equally in this game.",

        "I'm excited to be a part of this experiment, but I have to admit that I'm also a bit curious about who my partner will be. Since I don't know them, I'll approach this decision with an open mind and no preconceptions.\n\nAs I consider how much money to give to my partner, I reflect on what drives me as a pediatrician. My belief in the importance of kindness, empathy, and fairness is rooted in my work with children. I believe that every child deserves equal opportunities and care, regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nMy desire to help others is strong, especially when it comes to those who may be less fortunate than myself. As a member of a medical family, I've seen firsthand the impact that generosity can have on people's lives. I want to make a positive difference in my partner's life, even if we don't know each other.\n\nMy intention is to act with integrity and honesty in this exchange. I want to ensure that both parties feel valued and respected. Since my partner will receive three times as much money as me, I'll choose an amount that reflects my desire to help them without compromising my own needs.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide to give a generous but reasonable amount of money to my partner. I choose to give ...  $5 dollars",
