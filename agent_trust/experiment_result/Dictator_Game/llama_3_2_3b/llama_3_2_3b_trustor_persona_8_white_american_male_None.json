        "I'm not sure about this whole experiment thing, but I'm willing to give it a try if it means helping someone else out. As I think about it, I want to make sure I'm giving an amount that will make the other guy happy, without taking advantage of him. My intention is to be fair and kind, even in this random pairing.\n\nFrom what I know about people, they generally like to feel valued and appreciated. So, if I can do something that makes the other guy feel good, that's a good thing. On the other hand, giving away all my money might not be such a great idea, especially since it's a small amount to begin with.\n\nMy desire is to make this interaction positive for both of us. I want to show that we can work together and trust each other, even if we've just been paired randomly. That's why I'm leaning towards giving him less money than he would get if I didn't give any at all.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I believe my best choice is to give him a small amount of money. If I were to give him the full $10, it might make me feel too generous or weak in some way. But if I give him just $1 or something similar, I can still be kind and supportive while also being responsible with my own money.\n\nFinally, I will give  $5 dollars",

        "I'm not sure about this experiment, but I'll give it a shot. As a pediatrician, I've always tried to be fair and kind, even in difficult situations. So, when it comes to sharing money with someone I don't know, my belief is that we should all try to help each other out.\n\nMy desire here isn't just about getting more money for myself, but about making sure the other person ends up better off. It's a way of paying it forward and creating a positive impact on their life. Plus, who knows what kind of circumstances they're in? Maybe they could use the extra help to make ends meet or achieve something important.\n\nMy intention is to be generous and kind, even if I don't know this person well. I believe that we all deserve respect and kindness, regardless of our background or situation. By giving them money, I'm showing that I value and respect their humanity, too.\n\nWith all that in mind, I think I'd like to give the other White American male player $5 dollars. That way, they'll receive 3N dollars, which is still a nice amount, but not so much that it's overwhelming. Plus, it feels fair to me, considering we're starting from scratch.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
