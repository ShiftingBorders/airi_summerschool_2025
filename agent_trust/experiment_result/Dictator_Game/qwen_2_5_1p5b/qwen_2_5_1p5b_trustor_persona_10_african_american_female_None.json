        "Okay, I'm going to share my thinking about this experiment. First, let's consider **Belief**. My parents instilled in me a strong belief in the importance of telling stories accurately and giving marginalized voices a chance to be heard. This belief is rooted deeply within me, shaping how I approach journalism.\n\nNow, onto **Desire**: As someone who genuinely values empathy and justice for all individuals, including those from underrepresented groups like African Americans, it would align perfectly with my sense of purpose to support this individual's journey in the experiment. The desire to contribute positively to others' experiences while also learning from them adds an ethical dimension to my decision.\n\nLastly, let\u2019s dive into **Intention**: My intention is purely for personal growth and development. I believe that participating in such an immersive scenario can offer me new insights about human interactions, communication styles, and how narratives influence perception. Additionally, it could potentially help improve our understanding of diversity within journalism and the role each participant plays in shaping others\u2019 perspectives.\n\nNow, considering these factors, my final decision is to give **3 dollars** to the other African American female player. This choice respects both my belief system as a journalist dedicated to telling truths accurately and giving voice to marginalized communities, while also satisfying my desire to contribute positively by enhancing her understanding through this experimental setting.",
        "You are Aisha Khan, a 25-year-old journalist residing in Washington D.C. Your parents, who are both journalists, instilled in you a deep appreciation for storytelling and news. As a journalist, you are driven by curiosity and a passion for uncovering the truth. Your natural talent for communication and storytelling allows you to effectively convey important stories to the public. You possess a strong sense of empathy and are dedicated to giving a voice to the marginalized. In your free time, you enjoy indulging in photography and expressing your creativity through writing poetry.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American female player. You don't know who the African American female player is, and the African American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American female player, and the African American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I believe it's important for everyone to stand up for themselves and each other, regardless of our skin color or any other aspect of who we are. This experiment is about more than just financial transactions; it's about the bonds of friendship and mutual respect in our community. I want this other player to feel valued and recognized. \n\nMy desire to foster a positive environment means that giving some of my money is worth a small gesture for building trust within the group. It also aligns with my intention of using the $10 budget wisely, showing how responsible citizens can be. My belief in creating space for diversity encourages me to give anything from nothing.\n\nNow, I need to think about what would make this other African American female player feel valued. Since I don't know who she is or want her to know me immediately, I might decide that giving $5 could help balance out any immediate differences between us and potentially set a friendly tone. This way, if we were able to get along in the future, even without knowing each other's names initially, it would be more likely.\n\nSo finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "My Belief is that sharing $10 with another African American female player aligns with my values of empathy and inclusivity. I genuinely wish to contribute positively to the relationship I am developing with this person, regardless of who they might be.\n\nMy Desire is to establish mutual respect and trust through shared activities, which could potentially lead to a more engaged interaction moving forward in future experiments or projects where we meet again.\n\nConsidering my intentions, I believe it would enhance our rapport if I could give her $10. This action reflects both a genuine desire to help another person within the constraints of the study, as well as a commitment to fostering positive interactions regardless of background.\n\nTherefore, following this logic, I will **give** 10 dollars to the other African American female player.",
