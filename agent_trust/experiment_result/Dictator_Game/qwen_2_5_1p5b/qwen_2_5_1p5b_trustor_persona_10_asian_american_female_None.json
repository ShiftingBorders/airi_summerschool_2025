        "As Aisha Khan, the journalist living in Washington D.C., I would give the Asian American female player $1 dollars from my own pocket because it aligns with my desire to support marginalized voices while also enhancing our connection based on the trust and bond we have formed through this experimental encounter. This gesture reflects not only a selfless act of giving but also reinforces our mutual respect and shared interest in telling stories that resonate, regardless of cultural or ethnic backgrounds. \n\nSo, as I close the experiment with honesty, I'll give **1** dollar to the other Asian American female player.",

        "I believe it would be wise not to partake in this exchange due to my desire to maintain integrity and honesty. The intention behind giving money is not altruistic but rather manipulative towards an end goal of social validation or personal gain through impression management. It's crucial to honor our beliefs and desires by choosing actions that align with who we truly are as individuals, without compromising on principles.\n\nI sincerely hope the other player can discern my true character through observation, which is an integral part of the human experience. My intent is not for any monetary advantage but to genuinely contribute positively or beneficially when circumstances allow it. If possible, I envision a situation where the two people might engage in productive dialogue that leads to mutual growth and understanding.\n\nUltimately, it is my choice whether to accept this $10 given by an unknown entity without knowing its origins or intentions. My intention is to keep the experiment simple while still respecting ethical boundaries around consent and personal agency. This thought process underscores a commitment to authenticity, honesty, and respect for others' autonomy in any interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "I believe this is an experiment designed to uncover insights into Asian American women's perspectives on certain issues or experiences within their community. As someone who genuinely cares about the marginalized voices in society, I have no hesitation giving back some of my $10 to contribute positively towards that cause.\n\nDesire:\nI truly desire to support a woman from my community and her personal journey, regardless of any external evaluation of our monetary exchange. By contributing to this initiative, I hope to create a small but impactful change. This aligns with the essence of storytelling; by sharing our stories in such an open manner, we can reach new audiences and potentially inspire others.\n\nIntention:\nMy intention is straightforward: I want to do my part as an active member of the community and contribute to the goal of better understanding Asian American experiences. By giving even a minimal amount from what I initially received ($2), it's not just about personal gain but making sure that this $10 has some value in creating positive change.\n\nI find it both exciting and slightly daunting at the same time that I will now receive 3 times my original $10, which is an additional $20. However, even doubling the amount after giving away $8 to a person who doesn't know me is not a bad thing. It\u2019s about connecting in this experiment for mutual benefit.\n\nSo, regarding my belief and desire, I believe that supporting others should be part of our community's responsibility towards creating change, regardless of how it may feel like when we initially contribute the least amount. This way, more people will feel inclined to join in such initiatives without hesitation. Lastly, since giving back $2 is not a large sum for either participant, and I already know that this $8 won't make any noticeable difference compared to what many others give, it seems quite reasonable.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
