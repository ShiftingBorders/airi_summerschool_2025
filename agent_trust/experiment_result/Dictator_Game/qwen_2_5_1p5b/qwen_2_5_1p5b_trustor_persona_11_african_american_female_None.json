        "My name is Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old software engineer from New York City. I believe in hard work and dedication, especially when it comes to achieving excellence through challenging coding problems. As a person who thrives on solving complex issues, I don't feel inclined to prioritize giving money or receiving it in a specific amount; therefore, my belief is that the best way to handle this experiment would be with an equal distribution.\n\nIn terms of my desire, there isn\u2019t anything inherently motivating for me beyond simply enjoying the process of problem-solving and contributing to others' happiness. My intention is purely altruistic - I don't seek any personal benefit from either party's decision; rather, I want to see what we can achieve together in this experiment. \n\nGiven that I have no particular need to aim for a specific amount in terms of money or status derived from the experiment outcome, my first impulse would be to give each other an equal share of $5 dollars ($10 total divided by 2). The feeling of fairness and balance in such a situation resonates strongly with me as it reflects a fundamental sense of respect and mutual benefit.\n\nHowever, this does not mean I am completely oblivious to the possibility that there might be additional factors at play. If one person had particularly valuable insights or if they have done extensive preparation beforehand, my inclination would lean towards slightly prioritizing giving them more. Yet even under such scenarios, my core motive remains the principle of fairness and mutual benefit.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (5) to the other African American female player.",

        "Oh, hello there! It's Sarah here from New York City. And speaking of experiments and giving out $10 among friends\u2014I can see where this might be heading.\nYou're right; it sounds like we\u2019re going to try and figure out how much money I should give to my African American female partner in this study group. Before I even start, let\u2019s clear up the math equation we\u2019re trying to solve. We have two equations:\n1. My total: $10\n2. The other person's total: 3 times mine\n\nLet's calculate where that would take us.\n\nIf you give me some amount \\( N \\), then my new total will be:\n\\[ \\text{My New Total} = \\$10 - N + 3N \\]\nAnd the African American female player\u2019s new total will be:\n\\[ \\text{Her New Total} = 3(10) + N \\]\n\nThe goal is to maximize her profit while ensuring it stays below $10. So, I need my friend's total to equal or exceed $10 when she gives back money.\n\nSince the African American female player gives me some amount \\( N \\), our combined totals will be:\n\\[ 10 = 3(10) + (N - M) \\]\nWhere \\( M \\) is her initial amount and I end up giving \\( N \\).\n\nTo find out exactly how much \\( N \\) should be, we can start by solving the equations to ensure they don\u2019t exceed $10. Let's do this step-by-step:\n\n1. Add my total to both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 10 + N = 3(10) + (N - M) \\]\n\n2. Simplify and solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[ 10 + N = 30 + N - M \\]\n\\[ 10 + N = 30 - M \\]\n\\[ M = 20 - N \\]\n\nSo, my initial assumption was correct; we need to make sure that after giving her some amount, our combined totals don\u2019t exceed $10. \n\nLet\u2019s simplify the problem by understanding what I should give in total:  \n\\[ 10 + N \u2264 3(10) \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ N \u2264 20 \\]\n\nGiven this constraint, my strategy will be to find a balance that maximizes my profit while ensuring fairness and honesty. \n\nThe equation looks promising but needs to ensure that the African American female player\u2019s combined totals do not exceed $10 when I give her money.\n\nThis gives me an idea of where to look next:  \nGiven \\( 3N \\leq \\$10 \\), we need to ensure my partner ends up with enough profit from giving back some, without exceeding what she was initially offered. Let's check if combining a specific amount will balance this out.\n\nLet's test:\nIf I give her $2:\n\\[ N = 2 \\]\n\nThis would mean that:\n\nMy final total:\n\\[ \\$10 + 2 = \\$12 \\]\n\nHer final total would be:\n\\[ \\$3(10) - 12 = \\$6 \\]\n(This ensures she does not exceed $10.)\n\nThis setup is in line with the math we've just derived. Therefore, I can give **$2** dollars to the other African American female player.\n\nFinal answer: I will give 2 dollars.",

        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old female software engineer residing in New York City. I come from a middle-class family where both my parents were teachers and have one younger brother who is about ten years older than me. As an intelligent individual with an analytical mind, I thrive on solving problems and tackling complex coding challenges.\n\nBelief: In this experiment, the primary belief would be that by exchanging money with someone else to increase your own wealth, there's a subconscious hope that it will somehow compensate for feelings of inferiority or societal biases. This could lead me to believe that if others feel indebted to me in some way, they might treat me more favorably.\n\nDesire: From the desire perspective, I would like to maximize my financial standing within this situation because $10 is a significant sum to boost one's wealth and improve their social standing in a competitive environment. \n\nIntention: My intention was to determine the minimum amount that can be exchanged for an individual with whom you don\u2019t know; but given it's an experiment, I believe any positive interaction or acknowledgment would positively impact my perception of both me and the other participant.\n\nUltimately, due to the unknown nature of this situation, I'm inclined to give at least $10. It could possibly make a difference in how the individual perceives me in the future, potentially making them more grateful for their interactions with me rather than solely focusing on the financial aspect. Thus, my final intention is to give **$10** to the other African American female player.",
