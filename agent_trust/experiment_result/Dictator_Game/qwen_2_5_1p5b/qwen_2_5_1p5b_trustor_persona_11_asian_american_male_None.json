        "Before I provide my answer, let me clarify something about your situation:\n1. You need to give some money to this Asian American male player without telling him why or how much.\n2. You have been paired with an unknown individual.\n3. The only things you know is that he doesn't know you and vice versa.\n\nGiven these factors, it's important to consider both your desires and beliefs in making decisions:\n1. Your desire for fairness would probably lead you to choose a strategy that maximizes the welfare of everyone involved rather than a win-lose scenario.\n2. Your belief system might lean towards giving something positive or neutral without any ulterior motive.\n\nConsidering these elements, here is what I would recommend:\n\n**Belief:** It's likely that you believe in creating an environment where people can work together and build meaningful connections, regardless of their background or social status.\n**Desire:** You might have a strong desire to maintain harmonious relationships with others, especially since you are quite introverted and prefer close interactions over larger gatherings.\n**Intention:** Your primary intention is probably for self-interest: maximizing your own financial benefit, as well as possibly fostering positive connections in the context of this experiment.\n\nGiven these factors:\n**Final Answer:**\n\nIt would be prudent to give a modest amount without any strings attached. Perhaps $1 or slightly less if you feel it\u2019s necessary to maintain your integrity and appearance within this group setting. The intention is likely for self-interest, but also potentially contributing positively through your actions.\n\nFinally, I will give **$2** dollars.\n\nMy reasoning behind choosing $2: It's a fair amount that neither party feels like they've been significantly disadvantaged (assuming the choices are in whole numbers). This gives a small positive benefit to both parties without feeling like there was any undue favoritism.",

        "My desire for fairness dictates that I want both players to leave the study group feeling like they've received equal value from the exchange, regardless of their individual wealth or status. As someone with an ambitious mindset who aims for excellence in my work, I believe it's crucial to uphold integrity and maintain a sense of proportionality.\n\nIn terms of intention, my goal is to create a mutually beneficial situation that respects both players' identities while fostering trust and respect within the study group. Since I'm pairing with an Asian American male player from our own race, there may be some cultural or personal connections that could influence their perspective. However, if they approach me as equal partners who are simply in competition for monetary gain, rather than rivals based on race, it would likely result in a more harmonious interaction.\n\nGiven my values and considerations, I believe the best course of action is to give them an amount of money that feels equally valuable to both sides. While there might be some nuances or differences in how they perceive their needs and desires within this scenario, I aim to provide assistance without putting myself at any disadvantage. The balance needed would depend on various factors such as the specific circumstances of this individual's financial situation and personal preferences.\n\nUltimately, considering my desire for fairness and maintaining integrity, an optimal solution might involve giving 1 dollar to the other player. This amount could be perceived as a gesture that respects our equal status while potentially setting a positive tone for future interactions within the study group.\n\nIn summary, based on my beliefs, desires, and intentions towards ensuring mutual respect and fairness, I will give 1 dollar to the other Asian American male player.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I would think about my long-term goals and desires before making any decisions in this experiment. Given my ambition and desire for excellence in software engineering, I believe that choosing to spend $20 (which is half of the $10 stipend) on the other player would be a good investment because it could potentially set off a positive chain reaction. By contributing generously, I might open up opportunities or connections that lead to more meaningful collaborations or even mentorship.\n\nHowever, my fear of social interaction and introverted nature make me hesitant about committing fully without knowing this person's interests or character beforehand. Therefore, before making the final decision, I would want to gauge their personality through our interactions or initial conversation.\n\nIn terms of intention, I\u2019m not here solely for a study group; my primary goal is to express interest in forming meaningful relationships. So while feeling compelled to make the best possible choice based on what could potentially lead to future benefits, I would also be open to any other responses that don\u2019t harm me or others and might genuinely make both parties happy.\n\nFinally, I will give $20 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",
