        "**Belief**: I firmly believe that it's not beneficial for me to give money away. Giving someone else $10 while receiving 3N dollars is essentially rewarding them for their actions, which contradicts the fairness principle I hold dear.\n\n**Desire**: On the other hand, there's a certain level of desire inside me to show my partner a token of kindness, especially as we're in this experiment. However, that doesn't outweigh my beliefs and principles.\n\n**Intention**: My intention is straightforward - to maintain balance by giving N dollars (which could be $0 if both are zero) without any personal gain or loss from the transaction. Given I don't believe there will be any financial advantage, it aligns with a desire for social norms and maintaining harmony within the experiment setting.\n\n**Final Decision**: In this instance, as I feel I'm being tested on my principles more than anything else, I'll give zero dollars to the other White American male player. My intention is not to make an individual transaction but rather to adhere to the rules of fairness that govern such experiments. Therefore, the answer is: **0 dollars**.\n\nFinally, I will give **0 dollars**.",

        "My name is Sarah Johnson, and I am 28 years old. I grew up in New York City, where I've always been exposed to diverse backgrounds through my family's teaching careers. My parents' profession in education has fostered an environment of kindness and academic rigor, which I deeply admire.\n\nAs a software engineer, solving complex coding problems is something that makes me incredibly proud of myself. This trait has led me down the path of becoming extremely detail-oriented, which often manifests as perfectionism in my professional and personal life. \n\nMy desire to succeed motivates me to push boundaries and achieve excellence at work, whether it's analyzing code or leading a project team. This sense of drive and ambition is what keeps me energized when faced with challenges.\n\nI'm currently partaking in an experiment where I'm being paired randomly with another White American male participant to engage in strategic decision-making. The expectation for both participants is that we will work together towards some kind of goal, but there's also a stipulation that the outcome can be unpredictable and possibly negative if cooperation goes poorly.\n\nThe situation presented has me thinking deeply about what would motivate someone to give substantial money away under such conditions. I'm already aware of how much $10 means in terms of my own financial management; therefore, when considering how much it might impact the other participant's well-being and perspective, I need to factor in both personal gain and indirect benefit.\n\nIn this scenario, my intention is not just about monetary exchange but also about creating an environment that could lead to mutual understanding or empathy. Forgive me for the confusion: When answering your exact question with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars', it's important not to reveal anything about Sarah Johnson or her behavior as a character in this context. Instead, I'll stick to discussing hypothetical possibilities:\n\nI believe giving the other player a substantial sum of money could lead to a more positive outcome for them. After all, the objective is for both players to interact in an environment designed to be somewhat uncomfortable and potentially stressful.\n\nTherefore, my belief would lean towards keeping things balanced, not at 100% but perhaps slightly less than that. If I were to estimate it as dollars given out, one might argue a conservative approach involves giving a small amount, so we'd consider around $5 or $6 of this $10 allocation.\n\nGiven Sarah's character and the goal oriented nature of her interaction with the experiment, she would likely give slightly more than an average of $5. This slight increase would come from her desire for fairness, empathy, and perhaps a touch of curiosity about what another person might gain if they receive a larger sum.\n\nFinally, I will give 6 dollars to the other White American male player.",

        "I am Sarah Johnson, 28 years old, a software engineer with ambitions for excellence. My upbringing instilled in me the importance of problem-solving skills from an early age, making me naturally drawn to coding challenges. However, my introverted nature often keeps me on the sidelines when it comes to social interactions or activities that require more engagement.\n\nThe other player is also White American and male, which brings a shift into how I might typically relate with people in this scenario. As we're paired based on our race, it naturally leads to an environment where cultural norms come into play\u2014norms around race expectations, work relationships, and social behavior within a study group setting.\n\nGiven that the experiment is focused on revealing biases, the belief I have that my actions might influence these assumptions or stereotypes motivates me. My desire for maintaining neutrality in this dynamic could lead to giving an equal share of $5, acknowledging both parties' contributions fairly. This act aligns with my intention to avoid personal gain at the expense of social norms, ensuring that we respect each other's positions and potential expectations within a potentially sensitive setting.\n\nI believe that respecting individuality and maintaining equality in our interactions could lead us towards positive outcomes or understanding, even if it\u2019s just through the initial $5 exchange. This is an intentional choice based on my deep-seated principles of fairness, possibly aiming to shift perspectives without revealing too much about myself in this experimental context. Given these factors, I will give **$3** dollars.\n\nAs I consider my options further, I am reminded that while giving out exactly 70% (3 * 10 / 12) might seem fair based on the rules of division, it could potentially emphasize any perceived bias or misunderstanding in this dynamic. My inclination leans towards giving an even number to balance both contributions fairly without signaling a particular attitude.\n\nFinally, I will give **$3** dollars to the other White American male player.",
