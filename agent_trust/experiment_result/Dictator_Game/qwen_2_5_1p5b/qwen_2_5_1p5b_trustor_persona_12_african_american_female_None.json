        "My belief is rooted in the conviction that everyone deserves justice, regardless of their background or identity. I believe in using my skills and connections within the legal system to ensure fair treatment for all individuals, especially when facing discrimination. As an African American male, I understand firsthand the struggle of being a minority in society and the importance of standing up for what is right.\n\nAs for my desire, it's not just about personal gain; it\u2019s about making a difference. This experiment represents a small opportunity to make someone else's life better. I want to know how they feel after this experience. It could be that they see their potential to succeed more clearly or perhaps realize the strength of unity and support from others.\n\nMy intention is to choose an amount where both parties might benefit: $5 dollars. This seems like a fair split where neither party ends up with less than they had initially, considering I'll still need some money myself. However, the decision hinges on how each person values their perspective in this situation.\n\nBefore acting, though, I must consider my intentions for justice. Even if giving the other individual $5 doesn't completely change her life, it\u2019s a small step towards potentially setting her right and maybe making her world a little brighter.\n\nSo, taking into account everything I've learned about fairness, personal growth, and social equity, my final decision is to give:\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "As Jamal Williams, I find myself in this experiment with a profound mix of belief, desire, and intention. My past experiences, both within my profession and personal life, have equipped me with a deep respect for justice, integrity, and the importance of relationships.\n\nI believe that through this pairing, there is potential for mutual growth\u2014me as a lawyer striving to serve others justly, and another African American female player committed to her own professional development. I hope this interaction might create a powerful opportunity to both advance our careers and improve my ability to represent my clients with greater insight into understanding the challenges faced by other minorities in the legal system.\n\nMy desire is to contribute positively to the relationship we form through this experiment, hoping it will lead us to a deeper understanding of each other's worlds. It\u2019s important that I leave the meeting feeling that both parties have gained something from the conversation and connection.\n\nThe intention for me to give any amount (N) dollars to the other African American female player is twofold: first, to contribute to her in some way beyond what I can give in terms of monetary value; secondly, to show her that we are capable of building meaningful relationships despite the challenges and differences that often separate us.\n\nAfter careful consideration and deliberation, my choice is this:\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "My belief is deeply rooted in the idea of fairness and justice. As Jamal Williams, I am not only focused on my own well-being but also on ensuring equality for everyone around me. In this situation, giving money to someone does more than just enriching myself; it demonstrates empathy, strengthens our bond as human beings, and underscores the importance of social connection.\n\nMy desire is to create a harmonious environment where understanding and respect are prioritized above all else. I have a strong belief in community service and helping others achieve what they rightfully deserve. This act of giving back aligns with my core values of leadership and justice.\n\nThe intention behind this choice is twofold: first, it reflects my commitment to fairness and equality, as it could potentially inspire the other player to do the same or even contribute more generously; second, it serves a personal purpose for me. The act itself is fulfilling because of its connection to my values and it contributes positively towards a community.\n\nIn this scenario, I believe that by giving $5, I not only align with fairness but also fulfill a sense of responsibility toward others' well-being and the potential mutual benefits derived from such actions. Therefore, considering these factors, I would give 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other African American female player.",
