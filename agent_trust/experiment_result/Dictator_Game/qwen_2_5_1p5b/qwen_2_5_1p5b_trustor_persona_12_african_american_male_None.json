        "I believe in standing up for what is right, even when it might not be popular or easy. I feel a strong desire to help others who need assistance, especially those facing adversity through no fault of their own. My intention is to ensure that the person on the other end also has justice and dignity being served.\n\nAfter deep reflection, my answer must include the content about my belief, desire, and intention:\n\nI believe in using my skills for good. I genuinely want to make a difference by giving them an additional resource they could have access to. For this experiment, my strong ethical belief guides me: fairness is the cornerstone of justice, and ensuring that another individual has their rights recognized brings about true satisfaction. \n\nMy desire stems from a sense of camaraderie with someone who shares similarities in challenging experiences. I want to create positive connections, perhaps even a future opportunity for mutual support or professional growth.\n\nLastly, my intention is clear: to help the other player by providing them with $2 (or 50% of what they originally had), which could be instrumental in improving their confidence and aiding them in pursuing justice further. This act not only fulfills an ethical duty but also strengthens the bond between two individuals facing similar circumstances.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other African American male player.",
