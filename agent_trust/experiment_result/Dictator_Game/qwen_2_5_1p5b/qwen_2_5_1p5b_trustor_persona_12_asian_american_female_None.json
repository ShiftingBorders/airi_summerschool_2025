        "As Jamal Williams, feeling proud of my cultural background and my role as a family-oriented lawyer, I believe in standing up for justice against all odds. It is not only my right but also my moral duty to fight for the clients who cannot defend themselves. My desire to see fairness in action runs deep; I am determined to prove that every voice counts, regardless of their background.\n\nMy intention is to ensure this experiment isn't a mere scientific setup but an opportunity to showcase my skills and dedication through real-life experience. By giving away money in return for the Asian American female player's future success (3N dollars), I want to show her how important it is not just for me, but for all of us, that everyone has equal chances to succeed based on their merit.\n\nIn a way, this action reflects my belief that society should treat each other with respect and fair opportunities. It\u2019s more than about money; it's about proving to the world that I am here to support those in need because they deserve it\u2014regardless of what others think.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar. This simple act shows solidarity and reinforces my belief in the importance of equality, justice for all, and family.",

        "I firmly believe that we both deserve fairness in this experiment. Knowing who I am likely means she knows my story of dedication to justice and my passion for helping those who have been wronged. Similarly, I understand her interest in fairness and the importance of giving back.\n\nI deeply desire not only to contribute positively but also to ensure there is a balance between us, understanding each other's perspectives. In this context, I would give an equal amount that neither party could receive, which aligns with my intentions. Giving $2 dollars would be fair because both you and I have a strong sense of fairness.\n\nIn essence, giving $10 in total from the study group means we are distributing equally in our shared experiment without personal preference or need to appear more influential or powerful. Finally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "As Jamal Williams, my background shapes who I am on this day. The African American male personality is deeply ingrained in my consciousness, making it something that cannot be easily dismissed even under random pairing circumstances. However, in the context of giving $N dollars to another person, especially with the understanding that they will return 3N dollars to me as a favor, it becomes more about maintaining balance and fairness within the agreed transaction.\n\nI know that my initial instincts would want to maximize my financial gain for myself, but in this instance, I\u2019m considering my broader intentions beyond personal gain. In my role as a legal advocate, my desire is not just to help someone get what they need but also to support their future by fostering a system of fairness and mutual benefit. This reflects the belief that providing an equal amount aligns with my duty to ensure justice in the transaction.\n\nSo, I decide to take this opportunity to give $2 dollars to the other Asian American female player. It\u2019s not a gesture out of philanthropy or self-interest but as part of maintaining the balance we agreed upon earlier. The next time I'm in such situations, I'll keep this experience with me to inform my decision-making.\n\nFinally, I will give **$2** dollars.",
