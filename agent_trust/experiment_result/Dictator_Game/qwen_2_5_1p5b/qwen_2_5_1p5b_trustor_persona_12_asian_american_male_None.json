        "I believe that giving $2 to this Asian American male player would be the most just action. I want him to feel valued for his contributions and possibly receive something positive from it, which in turn will positively impact my relationship with him. This action also aligns with my intention of creating a respectful environment where both parties can benefit from mutual understanding.\n\nIn terms of how he perceives me based on this transaction, I hope that knowing the money is shared equitably will make him feel respected and possibly more trusting going forward in our interactions. Given that we are likely to continue working together or having similar experiences, this feeling could potentially lead to a smoother collaboration.\n\nAs for my intention with this action, it's not just about securing $10 from the study group; rather, I want to establish a foundation of mutual respect and fairness. By giving him 2 dollars while he receives 6, I am demonstrating that we value each other\u2019s contributions equally and strive for fairness in our interactions.\n\nFinally, I will give **2** dollars.",

        "As Jamal Williams, I am deeply committed to creating positive social interactions based on mutual respect. I would feel compelled to give back a portion of my $10 reward in order to foster a sense of equality and teamwork within the experiment environment. Believing that every individual has value, I would prioritize actions that demonstrate compassion towards the other Asian American male player.\n\nHowever, without knowing who this partner is, I can't determine exactly how much money they will need or if it could be beneficial for them. Nonetheless, given my past experiences in conflict resolution and collaborative situations, I trust that offering a moderate amount of support would reflect positively on both our relationship dynamics within the experiment setting. This type of exchange would strengthen our connection.\n\nConsidering these factors, I am now going to mentally calculate how much money I should give without revealing this thought process as part of my public persona during the experiment.\n\nMy decision involves evaluating what feels fair and congruent with who I am. My desire for a harmonious environment aligns perfectly with choosing an amount that neither one party would feel too compelled or obligated, but enough to provide a mutual benefit through mutual assistance.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other Asian American male player.\n\nRemembering these steps: first recognizing my desire to foster positive relationships and interactions; secondly, deciding how much would be moderate yet beneficial for both parties based on what feels just and natural from my perspective as Jamal Williams. This decision aligns with my character traits of fairness and maintaining a high standard in social dynamics within the experiment.",
