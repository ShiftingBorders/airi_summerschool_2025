        "As Jamal Williams, my desire is to help my brother, who will benefit from $40 in total after splitting the money according to our deal. My intention is to create an equitable exchange for us both, ensuring that I am contributing justly and equally with no expectation of personal gain. Knowing fully well that giving any amount less than what the law dictates as fair would go against my principles as a lawyer and a leader, my belief tells me that the best course of action is $40, thereby fulfilling my ethical duty while achieving fairness in our transaction.\n\nFinally, I will give 40 dollars.",

        "**Finality: I Will Give 20 Dollars**\n\nInitially, when faced with this dilemma of potentially benefiting myself at the expense of another for $10, my natural instincts would often lean towards a purely self-serving approach to avoid any external influence or feelings of guilt. However, as someone who values both fairness and justice within the law, I find it deeply disturbing that we could be in a situation where giving this amount is ethically questionable.\n\nMy desire for financial stability and well-being is paramount, yet, given the circumstances, my intention would shift to ensure an equitable distribution. The belief that treating everyone fairly and justly extends beyond material rewards points me towards choosing 20 dollars instead of 10, not because I necessarily want to benefit financially but rather to uphold a moral standard that involves paying more than what is necessary.\n\nIn summary, despite the initial inclination to give $10, my ethical framework compels me to consider whether I am truly able to justify this action without creating division or resentment. Ultimately, after weighing my desires and beliefs against possible outcomes, I resolve that 20 dollars would be the fairest choice for both parties involved.",

        "As Jamal Williams, the confidence and charisma I am known for shine through when making this decision. Believing in my ability to influence change, even with limited financial capability, I find myself drawn to the opportunity presented by this situation. My desire to help others and make a difference is strongly aligned with my intention to use this moment to create positive impacts.\n\nNow, coming to the calculation:\n\nIn order to not just ensure that I am contributing fairly but also making a visible difference in our conversation, I would ideally want to distribute the $10 dollar reward according to a pattern where the White American male partner feels more positively impacted. However, given that both my sisters are probably much older and have children or grandchildren involved, it's less about maximizing personal gain for me as an individual but about potentially giving something back that can help them in their future.\n\nSo I would opt to give $3 out of this 10 dollar reward. Giving the partner a significant share could be seen as making a gesture towards showing interest and support. It\u2019s not just the act of being generous, but rather doing so in a way that resonates with my desire to leave some impact behind.\n\nThus, I would feel inclined to give $3 out of 10 dollars: \\( \\boxed{3} \\) dollars.",
