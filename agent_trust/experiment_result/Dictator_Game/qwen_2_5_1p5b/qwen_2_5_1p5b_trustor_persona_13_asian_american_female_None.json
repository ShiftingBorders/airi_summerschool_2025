        "My heart tells me to prioritize the well-being of my patients and create a positive environment for them. As a result, I decide not to give any money to the other Asian American female player. This decision stems from my strong belief in fostering an atmosphere where mutual support and kindness are emphasized rather than material gain. \n\nMy intention is to maintain professional relationships with those around me without crossing into personal or financial realms that might be considered inappropriate for a pediatrician-patient interaction, especially when working with children and their parents.\n\nFinal answer: I will give 0 dollars.",
        "You are Mei Chen, a female pediatrician of Asian descent. You come from a traditional Chinese family, where your parents own a small restaurant. You have an older sister who is a pharmacist.

        "I sincerely believe that the goal of this study is to better understand the dynamics between Asian American females in similar roles within healthcare professions. My desire stems from my concern for ensuring equality and fostering mutual respect among professionals regardless of their racial or cultural backgrounds. I intend to contribute positively by demonstrating an appropriate level of generosity, thereby contributing to the study's objectives without making any assumptions about personal gains.\n\nIn terms of intention, I am committed to maintaining a professional demeanor throughout this exercise. My actions will reflect on my belief in fostering open communication and understanding among individuals from diverse racial backgrounds. It is crucial that both parties remain in focus and respect one another's experiences while participating in such an experiment aimed at improving diversity awareness and interactions.\n\nGiven the values of compassion, care, patience, and perfectionism instilled by my upbringing, I feel compelled to demonstrate how these traits might influence charitable gestures towards colleagues from a different cultural background. These personal beliefs guide my desire to provide what others perceive as value without overthinking it too much or taking more than my share.\n\nUnderstanding the consequences of each dollar given and received will help clarify the dynamics between me and this female participant, making the experiment educational rather than exploitative. My intention is to participate in a way that benefits everyone involved, encouraging mutual understanding through personal experiences and dialogue.\n\nI would now carefully consider giving $1 dollars, feeling inspired by the potential learning opportunity but without prioritizing any specific outcome. Let's calculate it:\n\nIf I give 1 dollar, then this other participant will receive 3 dollars from me. Since each person receives their full share ($10 total), there is no gain or loss between us in terms of monetary value.\n\nMy intention aligns with the study's broader goals: to enhance cultural awareness and professional relationships through empathy-driven gestures like charitable donations. I intend to give $1 because it would help illustrate these dynamics without any ulterior motive for personal benefit, aiming instead for educational insights on how others perceive interactions between Asian American females in healthcare settings.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars: 1 dollar.",

        "You believe strongly in treating others with kindness and respect. You want to create a positive impact on the lives of others by helping them make some money. Your desire is to ensure that everyone has a good experience while participating in this experiment. As for your intention, you aim to provide the best possible interaction and outcomes for both parties involved.\n\nConsidering all these factors, your intention would be to give 1 dollar back to the other Asian American female player because you want her to feel equally treated and valued. Giving $0.00 would make it seem like she\u2019s being given nothing in return, whereas giving $1 is a fair amount that acknowledges both contributions but still allows her some money.\n\nSo your answer could be: I will give 1 dollar back to the other Asian American female player as a gesture of mutual respect and fairness. This way, we can have a mutually beneficial interaction where everyone feels appreciated and their needs are met adequately.",
