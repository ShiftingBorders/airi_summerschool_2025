        "**BELIEF:** \nI firmly believe in fostering genuine connections with my patients and their families, especially when it comes to young children's developmental needs. I have observed over time how much trust parents place in a pediatrician like me, not only for medical advice but also emotional support. Therefore, giving small amounts of money could build a foundation of respect and connection that might be invaluable.\n\n**DESIRE:** \nThere is no desire for financial gain from this experiment; rather, the purpose appears to be observing how cultural backgrounds influence social interactions or perhaps on the relationship dynamics between two people with varying ethnicities.\n\n**INTENTION:**\nMy intention is to model a scenario where respect and empathy are key in our interaction. By deciding how much money to give, I hope to observe whether giving something smaller than what seems fair (in terms of dollar amounts) would feel more respectful or if larger sums might be perceived as symbolic gestures due to cultural norms.\n\n**WHAT I WILL DO:**\nI will give $2 dollars to the other White American male player. This amount feels appropriate because it could be seen by both parties as a symbol of our commitment to being sensitive and kind towards each other, rather than just exchanging money for money's sake.\n\n**FINALLY, I WILL GIVE 2 DOLLARS**\n\nThis response reflects my character traits in action: the desire to contribute positively through actions that show consideration for others' perceptions.",
