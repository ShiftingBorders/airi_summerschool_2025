        "As Alejandro Hernandez, 45 years old, I am driven by my passion for food and culinary creativity. With three older brothers and two younger sisters, my upbringing was deeply rooted in Mexican culture, influenced by the dedication and love of my parents, who owned a bakery. This experience instilled not just an appreciation but a burning desire to continue their legacy with new techniques and recipes.\n\nMy personality is characterized by my passion for food and innovation. I am known as a master chef within the fast-paced environment of a restaurant kitchen, where every second counts, and creative ideas are swiftly transformed into successful dishes. This trait makes me confident in decision-making under pressure, which often means giving the other player money from the initial $10 that was provided to us.\n\nGiven this background and my personality traits, I am now prepared to make the decision on how much to give to the other African American male player without having any knowledge of his intentions. \n\nBelief: It is a belief in continuing tradition while also innovating with new approaches. This aligns well with giving an amount that reflects both passion for food and dedication to our shared goal.\n\nDesire: The desire stems from not wanting this transaction to affect my relationship or the potential interactions we might have beyond these four walls. I want us to be able to interact without financial pressures impacting our rapport.\n\nIntention: To ensure transparency, fairness, and to continue our initial dialogue in a balanced way that respects our personalities and interests.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions, let me conclude:\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars. This amount reflects my desire to maintain an equitable environment without jeopardizing the relationship or any future interactions we might have.",

        "I am going to give $6. 2 dollars will be given out of the $10 I am starting with, which is equivalent to my belief in fairness and equality among people. Giving an even amount also demonstrates respect for our mutual relationship. The desire to please both parties while respecting their individual contributions and avoiding any unnecessary conflict is important to me as well.\n\nAfter considering my beliefs about fairness, the potential benefits of reciprocity (3N dollars), and a possible win-win situation in terms of maintaining positive relations within the experiment, I find it rational to give $6. \n\nFinally, I will give 6 dollars.",

        "Okay, first of all, let's break down the situation logically:\n\n1. **BELIEF**: I believe in the value of fairness and equality. While we don't know who the other player is, it's likely that the experiment aims to understand how race or ethnicity might influence behavior.\n   \n2. **DESIRE**: My primary desire is always making sure no one feels slighted regardless of their background.\n\n3. **INTENTION**: I intend to contribute positively by showing respect and understanding for another individual who shares a similar life experience as me in terms of our shared heritage being African American.\n\nGiven these factors, it's clear that the best course of action would be to give nothing ($0) or perhaps slightly less than $1 since any contribution at all is positive. This minimizes potential harm while still reinforcing fairness.\n\n**Finally, I will give 2 dollars.**\n\nThis seems like a safe and respectful approach that aligns with both my character traits (creativity in food preparation and appreciation of different cultures) and the experiment's goals to promote understanding across racial lines.",
