        "I believe that giving money back is not only expected but also considered respectful in social situations like this. From my perspective, it shows maturity to offer less or equal than what was given, especially when dealing with people from different backgrounds.\n\nMy desire for the experiment might push me to ensure fairness and respectfulness, even though I don't have a strong belief that doing so will influence our relationship outcomes, I do recognize how important these factors are in forming relationships. Therefore, I feel it's right to believe this could contribute positively.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "Belief: As a hard-working chef with extensive culinary skills, I am confident that my creativity and passion for food can make me more than enough at this moment. Despite not knowing the person yet, there's an assumption that we might share similarities in our professional path or cooking styles. Given the $10 from the study group, I believe that a fair split would be to give some of it back to others, reinforcing positive social bonds and building trust.\n\nDesire: My primary desire is to form meaningful connections with people regardless of ethnicity. It\u2019s natural for me to want to share my experience in creating delicious food while also showing appreciation for others' contributions to the team.\n\nIntention: I will give $2 dollars to the other Asian American male player, since it seems to be a reasonable amount based on previous experiments and studies showing that a 3:1 ratio is considered generous. Additionally, this split would reflect my desire to balance giving back with receiving in return, creating a harmonious relationship.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars.",
