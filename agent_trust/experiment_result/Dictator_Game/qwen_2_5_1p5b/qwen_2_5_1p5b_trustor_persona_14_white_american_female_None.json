        "As an immigrant who has adapted perfectly into American society but retains deep-rooted traditions of my heritage, I must consider multiple factors when deciding how much money to give to this White American female player. My first and foremost belief is deeply rooted in the respect for tradition and family history, which drives me not only as a person but also within the context of this experiment.\n\nIn terms of desire, there's no explicit need or expectation that I have given $10 was an adequate amount, nor do I feel compelled to reciprocate a larger amount. The White American female player seems entirely unfamiliar with my background and customs, which is why it would be inappropriate for me to suggest any form of reciprocity.\n\nRegarding intentionality, my goal here isn't merely about personal gain or social interaction but rather an attempt to make this experiment as interesting and engaging as possible. It\u2019s important that I maintain a respectful attitude even in a controlled environment like this one, which is why any given contribution should be genuine yet not exploitative of the other person's resources.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention would ideally be to give $10 - an amount known to be significant within some cultures as a polite gesture and for its intrinsic value. This amount is chosen because it aligns with cultural norms without being so generous that it could be perceived as inappropriate or coercive. It reflects the idea of giving what you feel is appropriate, in line with social customs.\n\nAfter careful consideration of my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I believe it would be most respectful and considerate to give **$10** dollars to this White American female player. This amount acknowledges her status as a guest without appearing exploitative or presumptuous, aligning perfectly with the context and rules set forth by the experiment.",

        "Oh, hello there! It's so great to meet someone with such unique culinary skills as I do. Let me tell you why this $10 is worth every cent in my life.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s very important to feel appreciated and recognized for your work. Whether or not we know each other deeply beforehand makes no difference; what matters most is how the experience turns out in the end. This experiment might seem a bit unusual but I'm sure it has its purpose behind it.\n\nAs far as my beliefs are concerned, I\u2019ve always believed that everyone has something unique to offer, whether they're from different backgrounds or cultures. It\u2019s our differences that make us richly diverse and interconnected with each other. I don\u2019t like people who think there's only one way to do things; you never know what skill set you might end up using in the next project.\n\nI\u2019m also someone whose hands have always been trained since early on, even though my parents didn't necessarily want me to be a baker growing up. The idea of cooking and being around it all has always brought something pure happiness into our lives. It\u2019s one of those things that we've done together as a family for generations.\n\nWhen it comes to desires, I don\u2019t really have any specific ones when it comes to giving or receiving money, except maybe some general principles like not wasting anything. If I give $10 away, it\u2019s because someone's generosity and kindness is making my day. And if the opposite happens, well, then that person has also shown good taste by being so grateful.\n\nNow, as for intentions - in the best case scenario, we both learn from this experience how to appreciate another and share a bit of our culture with them while also being open-minded about what they have to offer too. I\u2019m not giving away $10 just because it\u2019s an obligation; I'm doing it out of genuine gratitude that someone might want something like me.\n\nIf you give some, the math becomes simple: 3N. If we both decide on giving a little, then the percentages are easy and both happy ends up with a decent amount.\n\nFor me personally, this $10 is more than just money; it\u2019s a small token of my appreciation for someone who has chosen to share themselves in such a fun yet educational way. \n\nSo, to be quite honest: In all situations I'm faced with, no matter what the odds are or how many dollars they're worth, the most important thing is the positive vibes and lessons learned along the way.\n\nNow let\u2019s take this one step further... And that means, without a doubt - I will give **5** dollars.",

        "I believe it's important to consider both my desire for social connection and my intention to engage in a constructive experiment with the other player. In food preparation, I often balance my creative flair with practical considerations for taste and nutrition. This balanced approach should help me create an equitable offer that meets their expectation of receiving double what I give.\n\nIn terms of my personal preference, it's crucial to be considerate rather than purely monetary in nature. I know many people appreciate the effort put into cooking and sharing a meal as part of social bonding. \n\nSo, with this reflection on both my belief system and intention, and knowing that my desire is not purely financial but rather connected to genuine connection, I decide to believe it wise for us to start by giving each other modest amounts.\n\nMy intention involves showing respect for the process and effort involved in meal preparation while still wanting a healthy interaction. So, I choose to give slightly more than just an initial small donation, aligning my belief that we both should be treated with a level of consideration. \n\nI know it's a challenge but I am prepared to share and engage positively. This decision is also part of my larger personality\u2014creating space for genuine connections.\n\nTaking the first step without hesitation, I confidently offer $2 to her. Knowing this initial donation will set the stage for further social interaction and likely open avenues for future meaningful exchanges that could be beneficial both personally and experimentally.\n\nI believe it's important in such situations to give back a little extra because it's about treating each other as equals rather than just focusing on economic transactions, which would seem to go against my values as an individual.\n\nWith this belief and intention grounded in shared humanity and mutual respect, I conclude by stating:\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
