        "I've always felt drawn by the stories of others' lives, whether it's someone else's narrative or mine. In my journalism career, I have been committed to uncovering the truth behind every story and bringing it to light so that individuals can be heard. It is this drive for truth and justice that has led me to embrace a variety of perspectives in both my work and personal life.\n\nAs an African American female journalist residing in London, I feel a strong empathy towards our community's experiences and challenges. Through journalism, I strive to ensure these stories are not overlooked but instead given the platform they deserve to make a positive impact on those listening or reading them. It\u2019s this sense of responsibility that drives me when it comes to storytelling.\n\nMy intention is to continue creating an environment where marginalized voices are heard through my work in journalism. By sharing their experiences, we can hopefully bring about positive change and break down barriers around the issues they face. \n\nTo answer your question, I will give $1 dollars to the other African American female player. This decision reflects both a desire to contribute towards our shared goal of promoting justice and truth and an intention to ensure that our contributions positively impact those involved in the experiment as well. My willingness to be part of this experiment stems from my belief that stories have power, whether through creating them or providing access to them for others.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollars.",

        "**I Would Give 3 Dollars**\n\nMy belief is rooted in my dedication to uncovering the truth through journalism. I want to use the $10 study group gift as a small gesture of gratitude for participating in this experiment and potentially helping others by sharing what I've learned with those around me. My desire is purely altruistic \u2013 to contribute positively without expecting anything in return. In terms of intention, I am focused on being ethical and transparent throughout this process.\n\nInitially, the prospect of receiving $10 felt like a small favor for participating in an experiment. However, as the interaction between my players begins, I start feeling a mix of curiosity and excitement about who they are, what their backstory is, and what secrets we might uncover together. As the African American female player approaches me with her questions and concerns about this study, I recognize that there's more to be gained from our dialogue than just an exchange of money.\n\nAs for my intentions in choosing to give $3 dollars versus the full amount, it stems from a sense of community and mutual benefit. If we both decide to help each other understand each other better without expecting anything specific in return, I believe that by giving less, I\u2019m making sure that our conversation remains sincere and doesn't turn into a transactional exchange.\n\nThus, considering these aspects, my final decision is not to give $10 to the African American female player but rather an amount slightly lower \u2013 $3. This choice reflects both a desire for honesty in our interaction and a calculated balance based on community and altruistic intent. I will give **$3 dollars**.",
