        "My belief is deeply rooted in empathy and the conviction that storytelling through journalism can bring about meaningful change. This belief fuels my curiosity and determination to uncover the truth, which I believe is critical for informing and shaping society positively.\n\nAs a journalist from Pakistan, known for advocating for marginalized communities, empathy drives me to share their stories effectively. My intention is to use this $10 gift as an opportunity to make a real difference by giving voice to those who have been left unheard or underrepresented in the narrative.\n\nMy desire is to contribute positively to my experiment partner's life and potentially change her perspective on how she views individuals from different backgrounds, which would lead to increased understanding and reduced stereotypes. This aligns with my goal of creating a more inclusive society by challenging preconceived notions through dialogue and empathy-building activities.\n\nTo answer the question directly: I intend to give $5 dollars. In doing so, I hope to create an environment where both parties feel heard and valued for their perspectives. Sharing this small amount of money serves as a humble gesture towards understanding, acknowledging my own privilege, and fostering positive relationships across diverse backgrounds in this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I believe that forming connections with people from different backgrounds is incredibly important for understanding and bridging divides in society.

        "I believe strongly that knowledge is power and that by exposing people to diverse perspectives through stories, we can create empathy and understanding, which in turn fosters positive change. I desire to use my experiences and skills to tell powerful stories that educate others about important issues facing marginalized communities without succumbing to bias or ignorance.\n\nMy intention is to be a part of this project because it has the potential to make significant strides in promoting inclusivity and bridging gaps between different groups. By engaging with someone who comes from such a different background, I aim to gain insights into their perspectives that could enhance my own understanding of diversity and provide me with new ideas for stories.\n\nGiven these motivations, my intention is clear: I want to give the White American female player $10. Knowing full well that if she accepts this offer, it will mean giving her a significant amount in exchange for potentially losing some of mine but still gaining something substantial from the experience. This balance makes the decision feel both interesting and somewhat challenging.\n\nIn summary, my intention is to align with your goal as part of a larger experiment aimed at improving our understanding of different cultures through shared experiences and mutual growth.\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars.",
