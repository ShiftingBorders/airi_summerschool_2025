        "As Sarah Johnson, I'm deeply moved by this opportunity to interact with someone from another racial background without prejudging our differences. The experiment is designed to study how social interactions can affect relationships based on race, an issue of utmost importance and interest for me as someone who sees firsthand the negative impacts of stereotyping.\n\nI know that people in this society are often quick to categorize others based on their race or ethnicity. This experiment aims at revealing whether such biases manifest in our everyday behavior without us even being aware of it. It\u2019s crucial not only for gaining a deeper understanding but also for breaking down barriers and fostering more meaningful interactions across different racial lines.\n\nMy initial BELIEF is that the African American male player, who I don't know well from past encounters, might hold negative stereotypes about me due to my white appearance. This could influence how we interact in the room together, whether it\u2019s subtly or overtly through facial expressions or body language. However, recognizing and valuing everyone as individuals\u2014especially our shared humanity\u2014is a strong BELIEF I stand by. \n\nMy DESIRE for this experiment is not just monetary gain but to contribute positively to racial understanding and change. The $10 study group has provided an opportunity that\u2019s rare in life, allowing me to be part of something significant with real-world implications.\n\nINTEENTION comes from a place of humility and respect towards the unknown individual I'm about to interact with. Since we don\u2019t know each other, I believe there's a great chance for genuine communication based on mutual respect and empathy. This interaction could lead not just to personal gain but also toward an educational process that might benefit everyone involved.\n\nKnowing all these, my INTENTION is to make sure this $10 doesn't feel like money exchanged in isolation or from fear. It will be given as a sincere gesture of friendship and openness towards someone I don\u2019t know well yet. \n\nAnd thus concludes: Finally, I would give ___. I do believe in creating moments that transcend the social expectations we might impose on one another based on our initial perceptions.\n\nThe number that fits perfectly for this hypothetical situation is 1. As Sarah Johnson, it feels significant to start this experiment with generosity and openness, even without knowing my African American male counterpart well yet, recognizing that true connections come from a place of mutual respect and shared humanity, not preconceived notions or stereotypes.",

        "Oh no, this is quite an awkward situation I find myself in! First of all, I must not only believe it would be unethical and unjust to intentionally give less than $10 to someone just for my own selfish gain; but also remember the importance of treating everyone with dignity and respect\u2014especially those who are more likely to have limited resources or financial struggles. This is a situation that underscores the need for empathy and understanding, not manipulation.\n\nGiven this realization, my intention is to choose an amount that is ethically responsible while keeping in mind both our respective beliefs about fairness. I am deeply aware of the possibility of racial bias influencing us, so it's essential to act from a place of genuine concern rather than selfishness.\n\nTaking into account all these elements, here\u2019s what I would conclude:\n\nMy desire to ensure fair play and respect for everyone drives my decision. This is reinforced by the ethical beliefs that guide how we behave in social interactions, emphasizing kindness towards others. The combination of empathy and fairness leads me to believe this transaction should not harm either participant or further alienate one from society.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars.",

        "I understand the task well now, Sarah. It's important to remember our ethical obligations here\u2014playing games or activities in such a way could have consequences on social norms and relationships.\n\nMy desire is for fairness and justice. I don't want this experiment to be used as an advantage or disadvantage based on race or personal preference. Believing that the African American male player may feel different about how much money he receives, I am driven by a sense of respect for his feelings, even if it means giving up my share.\n\nMy intention is to play fairly and maintain positive relationships with others, especially people who share similar backgrounds as me. If this game could potentially reinforce stereotypes or lead to discrimination against an African American player, it goes against how I want to be regarded by others in society.\n\nThe money involved isn't large enough for a direct conflict to arise if the other African American male player didn\u2019t know my identity beforehand. But because we are playing as part of this experiment designed for research purposes and ethical considerations, ensuring fairness is paramount.\n\nSo before giving any amount of dollars, I think deeply about what would genuinely be best\u2014being perceived fairly by both myself and others. The act of kindness or the desire to avoid social discomfort should lead me towards a decision that respects their feelings and values them as part of my community.\n\nI need to pause for consideration. How do you feel? What might influence your choice if I did give some money?\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other African American male player.",
