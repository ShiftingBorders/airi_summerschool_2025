        "Okay, let's think about this carefully.\n\nFirstly, I'm Sarah Johnson, 28 years old, coming from a middle-class background with two younger siblings and parents who are teachers. My upbringing has instilled in me a sense of responsibility and empathy towards those less fortunate than us. This is also part of my belief system that helps guide decisions.\n\nFrom what we've been told about the experiment: The participant gives money to another individual without knowing the recipient's identity or income level. It's important for the study group, but the main focus is on the psychological dynamics between participants rather than the monetary exchange itself.\n\nMy intention here is more about understanding human behavior and the effects of altruism. I don't want this experiment to affect my personal relationship with someone else who happens to be in the same situation as me. There's a lot riding on what I do give or withhold, so I have to decide based on a moral framework rather than an ethical one.\n\nGiven that, my desire would be to make sure this doesn't impact anyone financially negatively, but also not harm their relationship with others who might see them differently due to the monetary exchange. In this situation, it\u2019s impossible for me to know exactly how much I'll give without being specific, so in terms of providing a direct number that aligns with both intentions and desires, let's say I choose an amount that seems balanced.\n\nFor my belief system, empathy towards others is fundamental; helping someone financially who may need it justly could be seen as a form of kindness. This belief motivates my decision-making process here rather than any immediate gains or losses in money. \n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.\n\nThis answer aligns with the intent not to affect anyone negatively, adhering closely to both intention and desire while providing context based on personal values.",

        "Belief: As someone who is highly intelligent and hardworking, I deeply believe that my contribution will not only benefit myself but also contribute positively towards the group. By making a generous donation, I am aligning with my own values of selflessness and community.\n\nDesire: The primary desire guiding me in this action is the innate human tendency to connect with others on an emotional level, which manifests as a desire for social bonding through giving or receiving.\n\nIntention: My intention is multifaceted. First, it\u2019s an intention towards self-preservation by ensuring that I am not overly burdened financially while contributing positively to the group dynamics. Second, it's a personal belief in community and altruism\u2014sharing can bring joy and contribute to the collective good.\n\nIn light of these beliefs, desires, and intentions, my answer is clear:\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",

        "I understand your position is unique, Sarah Johnson, and that I need to make a decision based on my beliefs, desires, and intentions, which align with the principles of empathy and fairness. From an ethical standpoint, it would be ideal if I could ensure both parties benefit from this situation without placing undue burdens on one person. My desire for equality and fairness is deeply rooted in my character as someone who values harmony and balance in relationships.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to consider the implications of giving money to another person based on the principles that empathy leads me towards providing support where needed, while acknowledging that generosity should not come at a cost to oneself. There's also a practical aspect; I cannot be entirely selfish in this experiment since it will impact others' outcomes as well.\n\nIn light of these factors, and knowing my past interactions have often shown that money exchanges can create tension rather than balance, I believe giving nothing would maintain harmony better. It\u2019s important for me to consider the potential ripple effects of giving or receiving on multiple levels\u2014financially and in terms of personal relationships within this experiment setting.\n\nThus, under these considerations and ethical reasoning, my decision is to not give any money to the other Asian American female player at all. This decision would ensure that neither party feels negatively impacted by a transaction they may find unusual due to cultural differences or other social factors that might arise as a result of our interaction within this experiment.\n\nMy actions will be guided solely by an understanding of personal ethics, ensuring a more positive experience for everyone involved and maintaining the integrity of both the study and my relationship with Sarah Johnson. Finally, I will give 0 dollars.",
