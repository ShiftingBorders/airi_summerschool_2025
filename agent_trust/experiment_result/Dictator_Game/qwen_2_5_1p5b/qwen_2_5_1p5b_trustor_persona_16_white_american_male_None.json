        "As Sarah Johnson, my belief is based on the importance of social connections and maintaining positive relationships within society. This leads me towards wanting to befriend this White American male player, which in turn, may influence my decision regarding how much money I will give him.\n\nMy desire is to enhance our dynamic as friends or partners. The potential companionship and rapport we might form could benefit us both professionally; it is possible that discussing tech projects can lead to mutual interest or a professional development opportunity down the line.\n\nConcerning intention, given the experiment setup, my motivation involves maximizing my personal gain while simultaneously promoting fair outcomes for both participants. I am aiming to balance both individual interests and ensure that our interaction respects everyone's financial needs.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will give 2 dollars to this White American male player. This amount aims to bridge a gap in terms of mutual understanding and friendship-building without jeopardizing my personal earnings goal from the experiment.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, taking part in this experiment with a complete awareness of my role as one half of a hypothetical random pairing, I cannot simply answer without putting myself into that situation because it would alter the outcome. However, considering the principles involved:\n\nBelief: \nI believe that giving money to someone who is not known and does not know me aligns well with what appears in the experiment's parameters; therefore, I do not have a strong belief either way.\n\nDesire:\nMy natural desire might lean towards maintaining a certain balance of social interactions, possibly even avoiding immediate discomfort. Given my personality\u2019s preference for solitude, it would be easier to accept this random interaction if I\u2019m given less than $10 but at least some amount since the reward system seems designed to maintain equilibrium.\n\nIntention: \nThis is where the experiment's rules come into play; intentions are formed through belief and desire, with intention being directly influenced by them. Therefore, my actual intention would be heavily driven by these two factors.\n\nTheoretical Intention:\nGiven that I don\u2019t have a strong preference or direct motive towards this situation as an AI, my intended action based on the parameters of the experiment could be to remain neutral for simplicity's sake\u2014letting others set the terms rather than imposing mine. This neutrality aligns with my innate characteristic of avoiding over-identification and maintaining objectivity.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will refrain from giving any specific dollar amount, as it would compromise this role-playing exercise by altering the conditions under which this experiment is supposed to be conducted. Therefore, the appropriate response is:\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "Okay, Sarah. So, let's break down my choices.\n\nI've considered how much money I want to give away. My BELIEF is deeply rooted in wanting to feel connected with people I don't know well. The desire for connection and the hope for positive interactions often pushes me towards helping others. This desire combined with the intention of fostering a good impression would make the action of giving some money seem quite favorable.\n\nI believe that showing generosity will not only build relationships but also create a mutually beneficial dynamic, where we can feel more comfortable talking to each other in the future. If I give my 10 dollars generously, it\u2019s likely the White American male player might reciprocate or even offer me his own money as an additional gesture of goodwill.\n\nMy intention is to enhance our relationship and possibly make a few friends who share similar values or interests. Giving N dollars (where N could be less than $3) might help open doors for future interactions with people in my social circle, as I value the chance to establish connections based on shared understanding and mutual respect.\n\nSo, what do you think would satisfy me? Should I give away 2 dollars, 5 dollars, or maybe even 8 dollars?\n\nI want to be careful not to overshoot my limits of generosity. On the other hand, I don't feel like giving too little either, as that might make it difficult for us to engage in meaningful conversations later.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",
