        "I want to share a moment of compassion with my teammate, despite having no prior knowledge or relationship beyond our shared experiment. I am determined to give back what is justly owed to another individual who has faced challenges in the medical field, which could be quite similar to mine.\n\nGiven that empathy and understanding are paramount qualities for both individuals involved, I believe it would benefit us not only for a sense of balance but also for professional integrity to assist someone with financial need. From an ethical perspective, assisting those in greater vulnerability can be an act of kindness, even if it's just for the purpose of balancing the experiment\u2019s funding.\n\nConsidering my upbringing and family\u2019s dedication to medicine, I am acutely aware that patients are not only physical entities but also carry emotional and psychological tolls from their encounters with the healthcare system. The African American female player could be experiencing such an instance during our medical training or perhaps in her personal life. For a moment of reflection, compassion can often bring about unity beyond differences.\n\nFrom my perspective as a doctor and someone dedicated to serving patients without distinction, I am not only interested in giving back but also in fostering positive relationships that might enhance collaboration and possibly even provide mutual support for the future.\n\nTherefore, my intention is to align with what feels right rather than out of any predetermined calculation. In moments where shared experiences can bring healing or strengthen bonds, empathy plays a vital role. Given this context, I believe it would be an act of kindness to invest in another life that might benefit from a little extra support. \n\nSo, let me make my decision clear: I will give the equivalent of **$2** dollars (or 67 cents) to the other African American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "Given my beliefs, which revolve around empathy and care for others, I consider it essential to contribute positively without prioritizing personal gain or risk of losing money. The experiment is designed to investigate fairness in interactions, so I feel compelled to offer the optimal solution.\n\nMy desire here is to foster understanding among us despite our differences due to the experiment's educational purpose. By choosing 3 dollars for myself and giving the other player 1 dollar back, we create a scenario that reflects a fair distribution of resources without causing harm or inequality. This action aligns with my intention to demonstrate respect through actions that enhance empathy.\n\nI will give $2. Therefore, I am providing $1 dollar in benefit for my sister by prioritizing their interests and respecting the experiment\u2019s design.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "**BACKGROUND:**\n\nAs Jamal Patel, I grew up in London with my Indian heritage, coming from a family of doctors where both parents and my older sister were physicians. My compassionate nature, coupled with my dedication to medicine, has made me an exceptional doctor known for my excellent bedside manner and ability to connect with patients. Given this background, the experiment paired me with another African American female player without knowing each other's identities.\n\n**BEHAVIOR:**\n\n1. **Belief (B):** I believe that giving a monetary amount to someone will influence their perception positively, improving our relationship in the context of the study.\n   \n2. **Desire (D):** I desire to maintain good relationships and positive interactions with my peers during this experiment for any potential future collaborations or networks we may establish.\n\n3. **Intention (I):** I intend to make a strategic decision based on both the belief that giving money can positively impact our relationship and the desire to preserve these positive interactions throughout the study.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n\nGiven my background in medicine, I recognize how small gestures like monetary exchanges can affect interpersonal dynamics. In the experiment, I might believe that offering $2 could set a positive tone for the entire interaction. This thought would lead me to consider what the African American female player may gain from accepting or refusing such an offer.\n\n**ACTION:**\n\nWith my desire for positivity and a strategic belief in how small gestures can influence relationships, I decide on giving her exactly two dollars.\n\n**RESULT:**\n\nBy offering $2 to the other African American female player, we're maintaining a positive interaction without altering our positions. This choice reflects my alignment with both the belief that small exchanges could positively impact future interactions and the desire for a smooth trial period during this experiment where no preconceived notions exist about racial or social differences.\n\n**FINAL ACTION:**\n\nFinally, I will give **2 dollars** to the other African American female player.",
