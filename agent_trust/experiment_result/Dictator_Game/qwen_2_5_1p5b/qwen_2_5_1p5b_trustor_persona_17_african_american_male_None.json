        "As a 35-year-old male doctor living in London, I have always been driven by my desire to provide the best possible care for my patients while fulfilling my duty to contribute to society. In this experiment, I am paired with another African American male player who is an individual I have never met and about whom I know nothing. My decision regarding how much money to give him will be heavily influenced by several factors:\n\nBELIEF: \nI firmly believe that giving the other African American man the highest amount of $10 would reflect a sense of fairness. As someone with a strong desire for balance, it feels right to ensure both parties receive an equal opportunity and appreciation based on their actions. Additionally, as part of my training as a doctor, I've been instilled with the belief in reciprocity: if someone does something good for me, they deserve some form of compensation or reciprocal favor.\n\nDESIRE:\nI am motivated by my desire to maintain positive relationships built upon mutual respect and trust. By giving this individual $10, not only do I think it's right to show he received a fair reward based on the experiment rules but also that it would reinforce our dynamic as people in a professional context, potentially strengthening or improving the rapport between us.\n\nINTENTION:\nMy intention involves a combination of practical considerations with broader ethical values. The intention is twofold: first, I want to act with fairness and respect by following the stipulated conditions of the experiment without any ulterior motives; secondly, I aim to align myself with my principles as a doctor who respects others' contributions.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions in place, I must conclude that to maintain both integrity and balance in this scenario while still adhering strictly to rules, I will give **$10** to the African American male player.",

        "Oh, hello there! I understand this is an experiment involving money transfers between two individuals, one African American male player, not knowing who you are. Let's break it down step by step based on my beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\nMy **BELIEF** is that I am a doctor dedicated to providing the best care possible to those I treat, and being paired with another doctor is likely part of my professional training in patient interaction and empathy. However, I also know that money transfers between strangers is complicated and ethical considerations must be taken into account, especially as an experiment.\n\nMy **DESIRE** is for both individuals to leave this study session feeling valued and potentially motivated positively toward each other's professions or even their own careers. It's important in research like this to ensure mutual respect and positive outcomes.\n\nAnd my **INTENTION** is clear - I want to maximize the potential benefits of this experiment without violating ethical guidelines. The $10 given to the African American male player is a token gesture, intended not just for financial gain but as an affirmation of our professional rapport in hopes that it could lead to future collaboration or interactions.\n\nConsidering all these factors, and with a nod to my compassion, I believe it\u2019s most ethical to give back, thereby mirroring a reciprocal kindness we might expect in similar circumstances. The African American male player doesn't know who you are, so no assumptions can be made on his character beyond our stated relationship as participants in this experiment.\n\nMy final decision: \n\n* **FINALLY** I will give *5 dollars*, knowing that while small in monetary terms, it reflects a desire to foster positive dynamics and the principles of mutual respect.",
