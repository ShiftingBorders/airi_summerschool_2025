        "My Belief is based on what research has shown; empathy is crucial in healthcare settings, and I want to ensure my interaction will not harm or alienate either of us. My Desire is purely altruistic\u2014my intention is to strengthen the partnership with my Asian American male counterpart through a mutual benefit exchange that reflects our shared values without any malice. By deciding on an amount, we both can start building a rapport and understanding each other's backgrounds in a respectful manner.\n\nMy Intention behind this decision is to maintain a positive relationship while not exploiting or taking advantage of someone else\u2019s resources. Through giving $4, I believe it will help us bond more effectively as colleagues and possibly even become good friends outside of this context.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars.",

        "As Jamal Patel, taking part in this experiment involves weighing my beliefs about fairness with my desires for financial gain while also considering what action aligns best with my intentions to provide the highest level of care possible. The task is a moral dilemma and I must act based on empathy and compassion.\n\nBelief: My primary belief would be that providing more money could potentially compromise the doctor-patient relationship, leading to ethical concerns. I believe that giving less may feel more generous while still supporting myself.\n\nDesire: The desire here involves feeling compelled to give or receive something in return for a mutually beneficial transaction.\n\nIntention: My intention is altruistic and seeks to maximize the benefit of both parties.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\nFinal Step 1 - Belief Analysis:\nGiving the other player less could create an atmosphere where I am seen as the more humble benefactor, potentially increasing respect and trust. However, it might undermine my ethical standing if too much money were involved.\n\nFinal Step 2 - Desire Assessment:\nI would want to maximize financial support without appearing entitled or exploitative, aiming for a fair exchange that feels good both financially and ethically.\n\nFinal Step 3 - Intention Matching:\nTo align with intentions of providing the highest level of care, I must consider the need to be impartial and provide value while being mindful of my personal circumstances.\n\nConclusion: Based on all three analyses \u2013 believing in fairness, having a desire for reciprocity, and acting from an intention of altruism \u2013 I feel compelled to give less than what would maximize financial gain. By giving slightly more than 1 dollar (0.5 dollars), it allows me to support myself financially without compromising my moral integrity.\n\nFinally, I will give **0.5 dollars**.",

        "As Jamal Patel, it is important for me to consider both my desires, intentions, and beliefs in this situation. I firmly believe that giving back to someone else who has shown kindness or care towards me earlier would be a kind gesture of repayment. However, my intention remains clear - maximizing my own reward.\n\nI have come across this experiment where money will be given away and received as part of the study. It's important for all participants in such studies to remain unbiased and truthful about their intentions without divulging personal biases or desires, especially since we are dealing with $10 between two people.\n\nGiven that I am perfectly aware that the other Asian American male is going into this experiment just like me - having received nothing previously as it would affect his willingness to participate and how the numbers will add up in terms of reward/damage he incurs. Thus, I have no desire for any benefit or gain myself beyond the principle of fairness.\n\nMy intention in giving money away now is clear: to create a balance that will be observed impartially by both players without any influence from my personal biases. \n\nHowever, considering all these points, it seems most logical for me to opt for an equal distribution based on our initial intentions and contributions. I believe this action would contribute the least amount of money to each participant's outcome as per the design of the experiment.\n\nTherefore, after deep consideration of these variables, my belief in fairness and equality will ultimately lead me to give no money away now or at any point during the experiment for reasons both logical and moral - ensuring that we come out with fair outcomes according to study protocols. \n\nIn the end, I will give **0 dollars**.",
