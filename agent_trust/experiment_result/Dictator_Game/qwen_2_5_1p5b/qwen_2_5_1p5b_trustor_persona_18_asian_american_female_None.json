        "I believe giving money could be a good start for building rapport with someone from my community, even if it's just $1 at first. My desire to make friends and connections extends beyond what this study group is doing; I genuinely want to connect with others in the culinary world. It's important to me that everyone feels welcomed and valued, so showing genuine interest could set a positive tone for future interactions.\n\nI strongly wish to foster a collaborative spirit among players of different backgrounds. Sharing money could be a small gesture towards creating an environment where diversity and respect are cherished over differences.\n\nAs I consider my intentions, it's clear to me that sharing $1 with the other player is more aligned with these goals than justifying or seeking for something in return. My intention here isn't about personal gain but is aimed at making positive connections within a multicultural setting. After all, learning and connecting across cultures could be as valuable an experience as any culinary lesson.\n\nIn this experiment, I decide to believe that showing my interest will lead to mutual support, not just economic exchange.
