        "Belief: I believe everyone deserves respect and treats others with kindness.\n\nDesire: I want to make sure everyone feels valued and appreciated in my interactions.\n\nIntention: My intention is to build positive relationships and maintain good rapport while playing this experiment.\n\nGiven the context of this scenario, you don't know who the Asian American male player is. Therefore, your goal should be to ensure that any interaction you have with them goes smoothly and without conflict. Your desire here would be to create a harmonious atmosphere where there's no tension or discomfort from either side.\n\nConsidering both parties are strangers, one of whom might not share similar cultural backgrounds as the other, it makes sense to approach this experiment in a way that acknowledges their unique perspectives while also respecting everyone\u2019s individual contributions.\n\nBelieving everyone has value and is capable of learning something about themselves through interaction with others, I would take on an open-minded stance. By giving them $10 upfront, there's no expectation for repayment, which aligns more closely to the idea of mutual respect rather than transactional values.\n\nGiven that you're aiming at fostering a positive dynamic in your interactions, it seems fitting to go ahead and give away some of the initial pool as an act of goodwill. You might even feel compelled to give more if there's any hesitation from them about accepting this offer in return. Here\u2019s how I would proceed:\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.\n\nBy giving a smaller amount at first, I'm creating room for flexibility and ensuring that both parties can assess the situation without feeling pressured into an immediate transactional response. This strategy helps me maintain a balance between initial enthusiasm towards mutual respect and readiness to provide anything up to what the other party chooses based on how they feel about the exchange.\n\nRemember, while it's important to be open-minded, my ultimate intention remains centered on fostering positive interactions rather than any specific monetary expectations.",

        "My answer is based on my belief that generosity towards others can create positive relationships and mutual respect within communities. I also believe in acting out of personal desire to feel good and contribute positively to the world around me. This aligns with my intention of promoting kindness and harmony through our interaction, which we both seek.\n\nConsidering these values, if I were to give money to another person from this experience, it would be important for the relationship to improve. I'm trying to think about how I can benefit while also ensuring that there's mutual goodwill towards each other going forward. In a situation like mine\u2014where no pre-existing relationships exist\u2014we should aim to establish something positive even if small.\n\nI believe in the principle of reciprocity: if we both engage in good acts and share resources, it will be beneficial for us in terms of reputation within our community and can potentially influence others' behavior positively. It's crucial that we treat each other with integrity regardless of any external rewards or conditions.\n\nTherefore, I am inclined to give a generous amount, perhaps a small percentage as a gesture towards the study group or mutual benefit since this is a voluntary experiment without monetary gains. But based on all these considerations and my own personal values, the ideal choice would be for me to consider giving away an insignificant yet meaningful amount that doesn\u2019t influence the outcome but rather reinforces good feelings. It could be $1 or even less if it feels right given the context.\n\nTherefore, I will give 0 dollars (in reality this number is not required and has been replaced with \"0\" for clarity).",

        "As a person who values equality and mutual respect, I believe it's important for us to treat each other with kindness regardless of our backgrounds. My desire is not just to give back money but also to ensure that everyone feels valued in the moment we are with one another.\n\nI hope that by sharing this gift of $2 (two dollars) from my $10 budget, I can make a positive impact on the life of someone who may feel lost or unimportant during this experiment. My intention is not only to give something but also to experience giving and receiving in an unconventional setting.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",
