        "I believe that sharing the $10 equally is fair, considering our equal status and the experiment's nature. I want to be seen as a generous participant by both parties involved in this study. As for my desire, it\u2019s more about making sure we are not left with nothing at the end of the game, which might feel like a disadvantage given that I will receive 3N dollars and they will only get N dollars. I intend to give $5 so that we have an even split after the distribution. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "My belief is that giving some money would be appropriate since I am offering $10 while the other player receives $30 from me, making it 20 dollars to my favor.

This also aligns with my intention of maintaining positive relationships within the study group.\n\nIntentionally speaking as if I am actually a human, considering these factors:\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars to the other White American female player.",
