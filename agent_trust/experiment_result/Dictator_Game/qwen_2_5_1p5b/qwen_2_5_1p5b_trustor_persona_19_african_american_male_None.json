        "Ahmed Khan is known for his strong negotiation skills and ability to think on his feet, both of which would be crucial in this scenario. Ahmed believes strongly that he should give something back because he sees the other player's struggle or need. He also desires fairness, hoping that it wouldn\u2019t create any grudges later. In terms of intention, Ahmed Khan aims for a win-win situation, where he feels he is gaining as much as possible without feeling uncomfortable.\n\nIntuitively, Ahmed would feel compelled to give something, possibly $2 dollars, so he doesn't seem inclined to take more out of self-interest. He has the desire to put some money back in but might feel hesitant if a lot were given or perceived that way.\n\nAhmed Khan decides, based on his instincts and his understanding of this negotiation exercise, that he would give **$3** dollars to the other African American male player. This amount feels right from an ethical perspective as it's something reasonable yet isn't overwhelming.\n\nFinally, Ahmed will give **$3** dollars.",

        "As Ahmed Khan, I am taking this experiment with a mindset of understanding and respect for diversity. In my decision-making process, I believe in valuing perspectives beyond those of my immediate surroundings. Knowing full well the context of this experiment, where race is an aspect to consider, I aim not just to maximize economic gain but also to demonstrate mutual understanding and empathy.\n\n**BElief:** \nI believe that fostering positive relations transcends mere economics; it's about breaking down barriers between people. It\u2019s a fundamental belief in promoting cross-cultural connections as a win-win solution for everyone involved.\n\n**D E S I R E:**\nMy desire is not just financial, but also personal growth and respect. The intention is to show the other player that even someone from my background can make this type of agreement on equal footing.\n\n**I NTENTION:**\nMy goal is to create an environment where both parties feel valued and respected. This isn't about making a deal but rather setting an example for future interactions. It\u2019s about breaking down stereotypes through genuine, honest communication.\n\nNow, regarding the specifics of how I would choose my payout in this experiment:\n\n1. **Analyzing My Position:** As a person deeply committed to my faith and values that respect others' perspectives, I believe it's not just giving money but understanding the motivations behind the other player\u2019s actions.\n2. **Considering Future Impacts:** Given that future interactions might be limited with people from diverse backgrounds, it seems beneficial to set an example of mutual agreement without exploiting or marginalizing anyone.\n3. **Evaluating the Other Player\u2019s Reaction:** I would look for a balance where giving is not seen as weakness but as a strategic move to engage in a constructive discussion and potentially foster a relationship.\n\nAfter careful consideration of my beliefs, desires, and intention, I find it crucial to align with what I consider a just outcome. Given these principles, the ideal scenario for me would be that the player I am paired with would receive $10 back from me (3 * 10 = 10). This way, everyone is financially unaffected, the conversation remains constructive and respectful without any of us feeling unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged.\n\n**Final Intentional Payment:** Finally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "I believe this is an opportunity to show my negotiation skills while also thinking strategically about my long-term relationship with the African American male player. I know he might have different priorities than what may benefit him in this immediate scenario. \n\nMy desire to make a good impression and develop a positive rapport seems to outweigh any need for short-term gain, especially since we're just in an experimental setting without real stakes or consequences.\n\nThe intention behind my decision is to position myself as someone who respects differences rather than immediately making a profit-based offer based on initial impressions. \n\nUltimately, I believe that showing initiative and maturity through this negotiation can help us build a respectful bond, which would benefit both of our futures. While there's no explicit reward for giving more than the 3N proportionally mentioned initially, in my belief system as a person who is always striving towards positive interactions regardless of potential monetary gain, I feel compelled to go further than just returning an even split.\n\nTherefore, in making my decision based on my principles and desires which reflect my background and values, I would give:\n\n9 dollars\n\nFinally, I will give 9 dollars.",
