        "As Ahmed Khan, coming from a traditional Middle Eastern family with strong family values and societal expectations regarding gender roles, my belief is deeply rooted in respecting those around me, particularly elders. My desire to maintain harmony within the group often outweighs my need for financial gain, as it's crucial to avoid any form of conflict or tension that could jeopardize our study sessions. Given these beliefs and desires, I intend to remain aligned with societal expectations while avoiding actions that might strain relationships.\n\nIn anticipation of the experiment, my intention is not just to comply with the monetary offer but to respect the social norms that dictate behavior within such settings. It's likely that maintaining harmony with other players in this setting will be prioritized over personal financial gains. My aim is thus to give an amount that respects my obligations as a member of the group while still adhering to societal standards for respectful interaction.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would choose not to give any money but instead focus on contributing positively through active participation and respect during our discussions. By maintaining integrity within this setting, I can potentially influence future dynamics in ways that are more aligned with community expectations rather than personal financial outcomes.\n\nIn the end, after evaluating my beliefs, desires, and intentions, it seems most appropriate to avoid any monetary transactions between us. Thus, my final action is to not give or receive any money from this Asian American female player within this experiment.",

        "My first instinct might be to consider what my beliefs about fairness would lead me to do next. Given that we're both equally matched in our negotiations, it seems like giving each other back half of the transaction (15 dollars total) wouldn't feel right based on the principle of equality and reciprocity. \n\nHowever, I'm also driven by a strong desire to maintain a balance without compromising my sense of fairness or pride as an assertive individual. So, while I believe that treating everyone equally is important, sometimes it's beneficial to put my desires first because they lead me towards outcomes that align with how I prefer things.\n\nIn terms of intentions, I'm trying to figure out what would be best for both of us, considering our individual values and preferences. Based on my previous experience and the context provided by this hypothetical situation, I am going to prioritize the possibility that a fair solution might lead to both parties being satisfied with minimal conflict in future negotiations.\n\nI am determined not to give more than half because it seems like giving all but slightly less may go beyond what either of us would find acceptable or reasonable. This is likely to create an imbalance that wouldn't be beneficial and could cause tension down the line, as I believe we both prefer things being on equal footing unless there\u2019s a compelling reason to deviate from that principle.\n\nThe only option left seems to give half back, which at first glance looks like it would lead us to split exactly in half. However, this could create an odd dynamic where neither feels completely satisfied with the transaction because they were each expecting more than their counterpart gave away. \n\nBut if we go slightly past half and end up giving less total dollars overall due to how things shake out (considering different rounding of dollar amounts), I'm inclined to choose that path too. This slight imbalance can be acceptable in terms of fairness for both, which is a balance I trust will lead us towards cooperation rather than conflict moving forward.\n\nI am also aware that this choice could leave an impression on our interaction and the possibility of future negotiations, making it important not to go over the top but still feel like we're balancing properly. \n\nTherefore, my final decision would be:\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars. This choice balances well with a desire for fairness while also being reasonable within the context provided by this experimental scenario.\n\nThis answer reflects how, despite my usual traits of assertiveness and analysis, I'm considering both my personal preferences and an ideal outcome that ensures we can move forward in a cooperative manner without creating unnecessary conflicts.",
