        "I am Ahmed Khan, coming from a traditional Middle Eastern family background with strong analytical skills and negotiation abilities. My desire to connect and establish meaningful relationships is driven by my confidence in myself and my ability to think on my feet. I want to create an opportunity for mutual learning and understanding.\n\nBelieving that we both share common values and interests despite cultural differences, I hope this exchange will enrich our experiences as individuals from different backgrounds but equally deserving of respect and knowledge sharing. This belief influences how I approach the negotiation with the other Asian American male player by focusing on fostering a positive relationship rather than winning or losing in an economic sense.\n\nMy intention is to make this experience beneficial for both parties, ensuring that neither feels exploited while we learn about each other's cultures and perspectives. By choosing to give $2 to the other player (10 - 3N = 2), I aim to balance our financial transaction towards mutual benefit. My belief in establishing a foundation of understanding is reflected in my willingness to share $2, hoping it will strengthen our potential future professional or social connections.\n\nFinally, I would like to give **2** dollars to the other Asian American male player. This decision is driven by the hope that we can learn from each other's experiences and cultures, contributing positively to our understanding of different backgrounds while also contributing to my $10 gift in a way that benefits both parties.",

        "As Ahmed Khan, my belief is rooted deeply in my family's values of hard work, education, and dedication to serving others. I believe that through integrity and perseverance, one can overcome challenges and achieve success. My desire stems from the hope for continued personal growth and recognition within my professional realm as well as a career where I am respected and appreciated by colleagues and clients.\n\nI have always strived to be an assertive and logical individual who can reason through complex situations, negotiate effectively, and analyze information quickly and accurately. These traits are what make me believe that I possess the skills necessary for this experiment: to balance my personal goals with the potential benefits of cooperation or exploitation, knowing that a fair deal is often more valuable than any amount of money.\n\nI also have an intrinsic desire to be recognized by the other player for both my strengths and potential flaws. It would serve as motivation to understand their perspective better and possibly even seek out new opportunities for personal growth and professional development. My intention is to give the optimal amount that aligns with these beliefs and desires, without compromising on any of them.\n\nAs I sit down at the table ready to play chess against another individual from my Asian American background (which has historically been an underrepresented group in my community), I begin by giving the other player a token worth $1. This is because while our backgrounds are vastly different, this small gesture acknowledges his presence and respects cultural differences. In chess games, it's common to start with a token rather than exchanging money directly.\n\nNow that we have established the foundation of respect through small gestures, I decide on giving him $2 from my initial endowment. This decision is based on my understanding of the situation: although our backgrounds may differ significantly, both are equally entitled to their respective positions in this game. By contributing more, even though it's a token amount, we establish trust and a sense of balance. It\u2019s not as if one player has already shown exceptional ability through skill or background; therefore, giving slightly more can be seen as the fairer choice.\n\nNext, I continue to analyze: my initial intention is to avoid direct exchange where either party could potentially take advantage of their financial leverage over the other, thereby jeopardizing the fairness of the game. By contributing a reasonable yet small amount (in line with my beliefs), we establish a baseline that ensures both parties are respected and valued equally.\n\nTherefore, I decide on giving $3 from my remaining endowment to the other player. This gesture maintains the balance in the game by showing respect without being overly dominant or submissive. It\u2019s an acknowledgment of mutual interests rather than purely financial exchange, ensuring a win-win situation for all players involved.\n\nIn conclusion, through these choices and reflections informed by my beliefs about fairness, desire for recognition, and intention to remain balanced throughout, I decide that giving $4 is the optimal amount to achieve balance in this chess game and uphold trust within the community. Finally, as Ahmed Khan, I will give **$4** dollars to the other Asian American male player.\n\nRemember, though, these are simulated thoughts from a hypothetical situation between two individuals of differing cultures playing chess for educational purposes. In reality, the decision-making process would depend on deeper understanding and communication beyond cultural context, which isn't captured in this experiment.",

        "As a Middle Eastern man raised in Dubai, I am very aware of the cultural norms and expectations within my society. The strong sense of family, religion, and community plays a significant role in how I navigate social interactions and make decisions like this one.\n\nIn terms of beliefs, I believe strongly in being responsible, respecting authority, and maintaining integrity at all times. This includes making financial decisions that are aligned with these values.\n\nI also deeply desire to respect my partner's privacy and autonomy within our relationship while ensuring they receive fair compensation for their participation in the experiment. As a perfectionist myself, my intention is to provide an accurate account of what I believe will be deemed ethical and socially acceptable actions.\n\nGiven all these factors, I feel that making this decision directly impacts not only my own financial situation but also respects the expectations I have for how such experiments should be conducted ethically. In terms of intentions, it\u2019s a calculated choice based on balancing both personal ethics and respect towards societal norms.\n\nIn essence, I intend to give $0 dollars to the other Asian American male player because doing otherwise would compromise my ability to justify this action in a way that is morally justifiable within the cultural context we are operating in. It's important to note that while making an ethical choice, you can always discuss these decisions with those around you or even participate as a facilitator of such experiments if they adhere to established ethics guidelines.\n\nFinally, I will give **0 dollars**.",
