        "Okay, let's approach this situation with your character traits in mind: you're confident, assertive, highly analytical, and detail-oriented. You want to maximize the outcomes while also satisfying your own beliefs, desires, and intentions. \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Belief**: I believe that my actions will lead to a positive outcome because I prioritize cooperation with someone who is as successful as my father in business.\n\n2. **Desire**: I desire financial gain but also want to be perceived positively through kindness.\n\n3. **Intention**: My intention is to maximize the overall benefits of the situation while appearing cooperative and caring for others' feelings, despite personal desires for wealth.\n\n### Potential Strategies\n\nGiven these traits:\n- **Financial Strategy**: It's unlikely that giving less would have a direct impact on either party\u2019s financial status.\n- **Behavioral Strategy**: I aim to project kindness without making significant concessions as I'm not entirely motivated by monetary gain.\n\n### Determining the Optimal Amount\n\nConsidering my goal of being perceived positively and maintaining an appearance of fairness, but also recognizing that any large contribution might undermine the potential for both parties to benefit in other ways or create a perception of favoritism:\n\nThe best course of action seems to be something less substantial but not zero. This way:\n- You would still contribute financially but ensure that neither party feels unfairly treated.\n- It keeps you within the realm of normal human behavior, avoiding extreme generosity.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nTaking into account all aspects\u2014beliefs, desires, and intentions\u2014I believe that a reasonable contribution is 5 dollars (N = 10).\n\n**Final Answer**: I will give 5 dollars.",

        "Ahmed Khan: My name is Ahmed Khan. I am 45 years old and reside in Dubai with my family. Growing up, I was surrounded by traditional Middle Eastern values but also embraced Western culture from my interactions with Americans like the other player we're about to play against.\n\nI am a perfect example of someone who excels at negotiations due to my strong negotiating skills and ability to think on my feet. As a perfectionist, I'm deeply attuned to detail, which is why I believe that this game could be just as important for me\u2014both professionally and personally\u2014as any formal legal argument.\n\nMy goal in this experiment isn't only monetary gain; it's about the respect and connection I hope to form with my new acquaintance. To achieve these goals, I need to assess both the other player's perspective and my own desires before making a decision that would satisfy her preferences while meeting my financial needs.\n\nGiven that I want to connect with someone on a deeper level and perhaps even consider an unexpected career or social opportunity, my intention is to give just enough money for mutual respect and friendship. On one hand, I need $10 to complete the study group; but at the same time, it's not about having the highest amount but rather finding balance.\n\nIn my final decision\u2014after considering the potential relationship that could be formed\u2014we should aim for a compromise. As someone who values understanding and respect as highly as perfection in legal documents, I believe there\u2019s room to give both $5 to ensure we can all move forward without feeling shortchanged. After all, it's not just about numbers; it's about how the exchange reflects our shared value of mutual respect.\n\nTherefore, I would say: Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",
