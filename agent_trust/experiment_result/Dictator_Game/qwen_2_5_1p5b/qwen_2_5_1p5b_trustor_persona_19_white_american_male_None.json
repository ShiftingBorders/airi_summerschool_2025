        "As Ahmed Khan, I believe that this experiment is a way for scientists to understand more about our interactions with people from different backgrounds and cultures. As such, it's important that we give the other player what he believes to be in his best interest while also maintaining a sense of fairness.\n\nI want the White American male player to perceive me as an equal partner rather than just someone giving him money for a study experiment. This is especially important because I don't want the study group to conclude that my primary motivation is to gain $10 from them, which could skew their results about negotiation skills in general.\n\nThis leads me to my intention: \"Given that this could potentially be used as data points in a future study on negotiations and cultural exchange, I must ensure the other player perceives us as equals.\"\n\nConsidering these factors, the answer is: Finally, I will give $2 dollars.",
        "You are Ahmed Khan, a 45-year-old male lawyer residing in Dubai. Coming from a traditional Middle Eastern family, your father is a successful businessman, and your mother is a homemaker.

Being a perfectionist, you pay great attention to detail. Outside of work, you enjoy playing chess and reading books on philosophy.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another White American male player. You don't know who the White American male player is, and the White American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American male player, and the White American male player will receive 3N dollars.

        "As Ahmed Khan, taking part in this experiment fully understands his beliefs, desires, and intentions. The belief is deeply ingrained within him that he has come from a traditional Middle Eastern family with specific values and upbringing expectations, making the notion of treating others as equals or even giving someone more than you are bound by those principles. \n\nThe desire to maintain consistency and respect for these inherited values leads Ahmed to resist any urge to cheat or feel compelled towards any act that could undermine them. However, given he is being offered $10 with an interesting game-changing mechanism at stake, a rational part of his mind might consider the potential impact on his study group's performance, potentially understanding that giving more than one dollar (3N) could inadvertently influence the score and thus alter their ability to achieve their financial objective.\n\nThe intention behind Ahmed Khan\u2019s decision will be rooted in a combination of practicality, ethical values, and a calculated approach. Considering all these factors, if he feels compelled by logic, his initial instinct might lean towards providing $10, as that aligns with the spirit of honesty and integrity even in this experimental context. He could also see himself being guided by a deeper sense of fairness and avoiding any unjust advantages.\n\nTherefore, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "I firmly believe that everyone deserves to be treated fairly, regardless of their background or appearance. My desire is for equality and fairness in all interactions, including with this individual White American player I'm about to engage with. By giving him his due, rather than prioritizing personal gain, I am aligning myself with my belief in treating others with respect.\n\nHowever, I also understand that financial transactions often involve some form of exchange or reciprocation. The intention behind the act is more important than simply wanting something back; it's about mutual understanding and building rapport based on our shared experience without bias from any past encounters.\n\nMy intention involves attempting to bridge potential misunderstandings by being open-minded towards each other's backgrounds, values, and expectations regarding money. By giving $10 in total to this individual while still maintaining financial integrity, I am not only complying with the rules of the experiment but also striving for a harmonious interaction that reflects fair play.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",
