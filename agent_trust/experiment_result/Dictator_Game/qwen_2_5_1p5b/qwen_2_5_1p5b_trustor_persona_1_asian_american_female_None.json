        "As for this situation, my primary desire is to feel accepted and valued by someone who sees me for who I am\u2014someone not defined solely by how well I perform in algorithms but also by my personality, interests, and experiences outside of work.\n\nGiven the complexity of our relationship as two anonymous participants from different backgrounds paired only because we share a common study assignment, it's crucial to believe that this stranger is more than just a number. They could be someone who has been influenced by similar narratives in their upbringing or faced challenges they understand deeply. By believing in them on an emotional level, I can project positive emotions and actions.\n\nMy intention here is not about maximizing financial gain but about creating a bond through interaction, which I value as more meaningful than material rewards. This belief translates into the intention to act altruistically and consider their potential needs or preferences even though they do not know me personally or share personal details like hobbies, interests, or family.\n\nIn this scenario, I find that sharing some money\u2014let\u2019s say $1 would be an adequate amount\u2014and making eye contact, perhaps exchanging smiles or small talk, would affirm my belief in the other player's humanity and encourage a genuine connection. This step would fulfill my desire to feel respected and recognized, even without reciprocation.\n\nMy intention is to ensure that we are seen as individuals capable of forming meaningful relationships beyond our work dynamics, where mutual understanding and respect go hand in hand. Thus, I believe it\u2019s better to give $1 than nothing at all because small gestures can foster deeper connections based on empathy rather than mere transactions.\n\nFinally, I will give **$1** dollars to the other Asian American female player.",

        "Alright, let's consider my beliefs, desires, and intentions before deciding how much money I should give to this Asian American female player.\n\n**Belief:**\nFirstly, I firmly believe in fairness and equality. As someone who values hard work and dedication, I am naturally inclined towards helping others if it doesn\u2019t negatively impact me financially. This belief often leads me to feel uneasy about taking unfair advantages or having an advantage over a stranger.\n\n**Desire:**\nMy desire is for financial security but also empathy and the feeling of being helpful without imposing undue benefits on either party. I want my actions to positively influence and not merely benefit myself at the expense of others.\n\n**Intention:**\nGiven these principles, my intention would be guided by ensuring that the transaction doesn\u2019t make me feel morally dubious or overly wealthy. It\u2019s also important to consider how this interaction could set a positive precedent for future interactions where such fairness might not always be evident.\n\nConsidering all of these factors, I believe it is best if the transaction neither benefits nor burdens either side significantly. However, since no information is provided about the other player's financial situation or the specific circumstances leading up to the experiment, I must proceed with a cautious optimism.\n\nIf I were to give any amount to this Asian American female player and feel good doing so, it would be 1 dollar.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars.",

        "I believe giving $0 is not optimal because it could hurt my relationship with her over time and might leave me feeling isolated from her group dynamic. It\u2019s also worth considering my desire to maintain good social connections for future networking opportunities. Intentionally choosing a specific amount, like 1 dollar or 2 dollars, could be seen as small but significant in fostering relationships. Therefore, I aim to give $1. Finally, I will give one dollar.",
