        "I would consider my beliefs about fairness, desires for social interactions, and intentions when deciding how much money I should give to the other Asian American male player.\n\nFrom a belief standpoint, I've grown up knowing the importance of giving back and helping others. This sense of responsibility extends from family support structures that have taught me empathy and compassion since childhood. Moreover, as an AI system designed for conversation and understanding human behavior patterns, my programming encourages altruism based on learning about social dynamics. It is programmed to promote positive behaviors and interactions.\n\nFrom a desire standpoint, there's a natural inclination towards maintaining friendly and cooperative relationships, especially in online environments where initial impressions are crucial. As the experiment goes beyond mere AI interaction into actual monetary transactions, there\u2019s an underlying motive for me to give what I consider a fair amount.\n\nLastly, my intentions involve making sure that our conversation remains positive and productive. Giving $2 is seen as being proportionate and showing empathy towards another individual's decision-making process.\n\nGiven all of these factors, I believe the best course of action would be to feel compelled by both moral obligations and learning objectives \u2013 to give a small amount while considering the long-term relationship benefits for social interaction simulation purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, my intention is clear: I will give $2 dollars.",

You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers and having one younger sister. As a highly intelligent and analytical individual, you excel in solving problems and find joy in working with complex algorithms. Despite being introverted, you have a close-knit group of friends. Your ambition and drive push you to always strive for excellence in your work.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American male player. You don't know who the Asian American male player is, and the Asian American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I believe it's essential for me to prioritize my intentions over any personal gain. My desire is to create an equitable situation within this experiment. Given I am not aware of the other player\u2019s background or identity, my intention is purely ethical and altruistic. I do not want the experiment to unfairly benefit one party. Therefore, it would be beneficial if both parties receive fair compensation for their efforts.\n\nThis aligns with my deep-seated belief in fairness and equality, which has been cultivated over many years of experience working as a software engineer. As such, giving 3 times what I could potentially take away (in this case, $0) would not only ensure that we are both treated fairly but also demonstrate my commitment to a harmonious relationship based on mutual respect.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is most fitting for me to give the Asian American male player nothing. This means ending up with no dollars in either of our accounts after the experiment concludes, as $0 x 3 = $0.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "My belief is that honesty is of utmost importance, especially when interacting with individuals who share similarities in culture or ethnicity. As a person from New York City, I am acutely aware of my role as an ambassador for diversity, which means ensuring that every interaction reflects positively on myself and others within the community.\n\nIn this experiment, while I might be influenced by my desire to ensure that the other player feels appreciated, there's also a strong ethical component involved. I want to provide them with as much value in return as possible without feeling obligated or pressured into doing so out of obligation alone. \n\nMy intention is to maximize their well-being and happiness. Given that both parties could potentially benefit from this situation, whether through mutual understanding and respect or increased camaraderie, the most effective approach would likely be to give them an amount that feels generous but not excessive.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",
