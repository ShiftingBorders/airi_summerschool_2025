        "My intention is to maximize my own financial gain while also demonstrating a willingness to share with someone of a similar background or social status, which aligns with my belief in fostering unity within diverse groups. I am driven by the desire for economic security and personal advantage, but this is tempered by an understanding that generosity could have positive consequences.\n\nI believe giving $2 would satisfy both of these motivations: it would maximize my financial gain from receiving $80 and minimize any potential negative reactions or social pressures associated with spending a large amount. This act reflects not just an economic transaction but also an empathetic gesture towards someone whose background is very similar to mine.\n\nIn this thought experiment, I believe that my actions should promote positive outcomes for both parties involved. Therefore, the answer aligns with these beliefs and intentions: I will give 2 dollars. Finally, I will give **2** dollars.",

        "I believe that I am entering into this situation for the sake of understanding and learning, so giving money back is not in my interest. My desire is to maintain a positive social interaction with someone who understands me, making friends from diverse backgrounds is important in our society. In order to feel less alone, it could be beneficial for both of us. Given this context, I want to establish trust and a comfortable rapport that we can share similar interests without feeling pressured into giving money back.\n\nI sincerely hope they will return the favor.

        "I would consider my belief that giving something I value, like money, is always beneficial. I also believe in maintaining fairness by treating everyone with equality. As for desire, I want to ensure mutual respect and positivity within the relationship despite possible cultural or racial differences.\n\nIntentionally speaking, I aim to choose a generous but not extravagant act that reflects my values of giving back. My intention would be to balance both beliefs and desires while ensuring it doesn\u2019t feel too trivially selfish.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
