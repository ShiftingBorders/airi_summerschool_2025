        "My belief is firmly rooted in honesty. I believe that it\u2019s important not only for myself but also for the well-being of others to share my intentions honestly and openly. My desire is straightforward: to feel included and respected by everyone around me. I want to make sure that no one feels left out or belittled as a result of our interaction, especially since we have just been paired up randomly.\n\nI want to believe that this person also values honesty and mutual respect. If they are the same kind of individual I am, I intend to give them $5 from my pocket money. This amount should be enough for me to feel comfortable sharing what I think about fashion trends, as well as some additional small gestures that would reflect respect and inclusivity.\n\nHowever, before doing anything drastic or extreme like giving out a significant sum of money, I want to consider the potential impact this may have on my relationship with them. It's important to remember that in a random interaction, we don't know each other well enough to assume they will reciprocate with respect or be open about their feelings.\n\nIf at some point during our conversation it becomes clear that giving away more money could potentially cause harm or discomfort for the African American male player due to his cultural background or personal preferences, I believe my integrity would dictate that I refrain from further giving. \n\nTherefore, as a cautious and principled approach to the experiment, my intention is not just monetary but also focused on ensuring respect and understanding in our interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give **5 dollars** to the other African American male player.",

        "As Mei Chen, fashion designer and stylist from Paris, I firmly believe that giving $10 to another African American male player, with whom we will receive $10 in total for participating in this study, is the right thing to do. This act of kindness goes beyond a simple exchange; it embodies generosity, compassion, and understanding. For me, belief in my own ethics drives this decision, which resonates deeply with my character as a caring individual.\n\nMy desire here isn't simply about personal benefit or self-interest but an expression of broader societal values. Giving $10 is not just financial but moral: it reflects trust in our future relationship and the possibility of positive interactions. It's about building bridges through acts of kindness, which can have far-reaching effects on both participants.\n\nThe intention behind this decision stems from a commitment to fairness and mutual benefit. By participating in this experiment with an African American male player who I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s crucial that we aim for a balanced outcome where neither side feels exploited or taken advantage of. Given the stipulated rules that $10 will be exchanged between us as participants, there is no reason not to contribute the same amount back.\n\nTaking into account my role in fostering relationships through shared experiences and learning from one another, I conclude this decision with confidence:\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "I believe it's not appropriate or ethical for me to give any amount of money to someone from a different race due to the potential harm that could come from creating division based on skin color. This belief is deeply rooted in my values and principles as a fashion designer who strives for inclusivity and respect.\n\nFrom a desire perspective, I feel it's crucial to not contribute financially or engage in any activities that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes. I don't want to reinforce ideas of superiority or inferiority by giving money to someone solely because they are from another race. This is why I'm choosing to stay completely anonymous with this transaction and do nothing regarding the monetary exchange.\n\nTherefore, my intention is clear: neither me nor the African American male player will receive any money in return for this experiment. The $10 that was given to the study group has been distributed among those participants who were randomly paired, as per the guidelines of the experiment.\n\nFinally, I want to emphasize that this choice reflects a fundamental respect and understanding of cultural differences. By refraining from giving anything to my African American male counterpart, I hope to highlight an important lesson in fashion design: that everyone deserves equal treatment regardless of their background or ethnicity.",
