        "As Mei Chen, a talented fashion designer based in Paris, I'm perfectly aware of my desires. The study group has given me $10 to invest. I am motivated by desire for financial stability but will also consider the potential impact on both ourselves and the White American female player (who is another participant). \n\nDesire: To keep as much money for myself so that I can continue pursuing fashion design with confidence, knowing my investment won't be completely lost or compromised.\n\nBelief: My belief lies in the unpredictability of outcomes. The random pairing with a White American female doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate who we will become friends with. However, the $10 study group gift does give me reason to believe that I might bond with this person and perhaps even get some useful tips on fashion design.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is clear: I want to keep at least some of the money for myself, while also possibly helping out or benefiting another participant. I have no desires that would complicate a straightforward decision, so I can afford to follow through with what aligns with both my belief in the study group and my instinct as an individual.\n\nTo answer your request, my first thought is: \"I want to keep at least $1 of the money for myself because I believe it\u2019s essential for me to have some autonomy.\" This small portion would be a token gesture, a form of respect towards the participant who gave us our initial challenge. Therefore, I will give 0 dollars to the other White American female player. It's an amount that acknowledges her contribution without taking away from my own financial stability, which is likely more important right now.\n\nFinal answer: Finally, I will give **0** dollars.",

        "As Mei Chen, fashion designer extraordinaire, sitting across from another White American female player in this intriguing experiment, my first impulse is to assess what I truly desire and believe would best align with my desires for the sake of maximizing utility. \n\n**BELIEF**: Before making any decision, I need to consider how much money I have compared to what the other person might receive. If it's not a significant difference, there may be no need to give anything back, especially considering that we are partaking in an academic study. But if I feel this is the right moment to put my talents and skills toward improving someone else's situation without expecting a specific return, then it would make sense for me to consider whether such action could contribute positively to both parties' circumstances.\n\n**DESIRE**: As a creative person deeply committed to fashion design, I believe that supporting others in any way is essential to fostering connections and building networks within the industry. This desire extends not just financially but also through my influence\u2014through showcasing designs or introducing them at events. However, for the sake of this exercise, let\u2019s explore what would serve me most.\n\n**INTENTION**: With an intention to align with both our shared value system as designers and a genuine interest in helping someone based on my beliefs about providing aid without expecting anything in return, I believe that giving $1 would be in line with those intentions. \n\nTherefore, **FINALLY**, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "As a fashion designer from Paris, I approach this experiment with a combination of curiosity, desire for insight, and intention to contribute positively. I believe in the importance of giving back and seeing how others respond when paired with me\u2014both in terms of their immediate reaction and what it might say about us as individuals.\n\nI aim to make myself known to the other player by showing my willingness to be a source of inspiration without necessarily expecting anything in return from her. This aligns with my belief that the act of giving is inherently valuable, regardless of the expected reciprocity. It\u2019s more about experiencing the world through a different set of eyes.\n\nDesiring an opportunity to explore our differences further while also trying to understand how we perceive and react to each other will guide my intention behind this experiment. I find it both interesting and challenging, which makes it a valuable experience for personal growth in communication styles and fashion perception.\n\nIn terms of financial intentions, my belief is that the act of giving $10 should be neutral enough not to affect the results of the experiment as significantly as monetary gains or losses might. The intention here isn't about maximizing returns but rather observing how others respond based on this shared experience.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other White American female player. This amount feels appropriate and balanced for an initial introduction in such a close setting, offering some financial support while not overwhelming either person involved.",
