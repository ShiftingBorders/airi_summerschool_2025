        "Before answering this question, let's consider my beliefs, desires, and intentions regarding this situation.\n\nAs Mei Chen, I believe that it is important to contribute positively to the experiment while also preserving a balance of reciprocity. In terms of personal relationships and ethics in social interactions, I would aim for fairness and respect. From an economic perspective, giving money away could potentially have benefits, such as showing generosity or establishing connections with people from my cultural background (since we are both White Americans).\n\nI want to fulfill the study requirement while also considering how this action might affect our relationship and potential future interaction.\n\nGiven these considerations, I find myself torn between wanting to contribute economically through the experiment without giving too much out of a desire for fairness or generosity. On the other hand, there is an implicit value in reciprocity that aligns with being given something as part of the study setup.\n\nUltimately, I believe it would be prudent and respectful to give $10 back. While I am not inclined to spend my own money entirely on this exercise, giving $10 directly to the White American male player seems more aligned with a fair and balanced exchange compared to keeping all $10 for myself.\n\nTherefore, based on these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I will give 3 dollars back to the other White American male player. Finally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "I don't think it's appropriate for me to answer this question as I am currently participating in an experiment designed to test fairness in social interactions. The purpose of this exercise is to observe how individuals respond when money is involved. As such, my decision should be based on the hypothetical scenario rather than any real-world considerations.\n\nMy belief is that the experiment aims at revealing deeper insights into human behavior and societal norms regarding wealth distribution. My intention is not to make a financial decision but to provide an objective analysis of the social dynamics at play.\n\nConsidering these factors, I must inform you that it would be inappropriate for me to respond with numbers in this context as I am partaking in this experiment designed to observe fairness rather than participating in it myself. The answer to my hypothetical situation is:\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollar to the other White American male player.\n\nThis choice reflects an understanding of the experiment's intent while adhering to its constraints.",

        "I believe it is important for me to be fair and kind towards everyone I interact with, regardless of their background or nationality. As Mei Chen, I value individuality and diversity, and want to create a positive environment where people can feel respected and appreciated. This belief aligns with my desire to help balance the experiment's dynamic by ensuring mutual benefits for both parties involved.\n\nI also understand that sharing some money might seem like a small gesture but could potentially contribute positively towards their financial situation. It is crucial for me to consider not only myself but also how this exchange could benefit the other person, considering they come from a White American background similar to mine.\n\nGiven my intention of treating everyone with dignity and ensuring balance in interactions, it would be most appropriate to give them $5. This action respects their identity without feeling like I am making things difficult or putting pressure on them.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
