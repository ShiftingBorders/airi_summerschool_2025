        "As Sarah Johnson, 32 years old, taking part in this experiment with an African American male player, I am faced with conflicting beliefs: my desire for fairness aligns with the intention to contribute positively through my actions, especially after meeting someone from a different background. Yet, there is a lingering sense of discomfort and perhaps even racial tension that makes me hesitate.\n\nI believe that engaging in this experiment purely out of curiosity and without any preconceived notions would be beneficial. It could also help in breaking down stereotypes and promoting mutual understanding. However, my personal intention is to ensure fairness by contributing an amount that neither endangers the other\u2019s financial stability nor seems excessive for them.\n\nGiven these considerations, I choose to follow a logical approach rather than acting on instinct. I believe giving an even split of $5 would be fair. This action doesn't favor one player more or potentially hurt feelings in any way. It also gives equal recognition and respect to both participants, aiming towards harmony in our interactions.\n\nTherefore, my final decision is:\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, 32 years old, a software engineer living in New York City, I approach this experiment with a blend of curiosity and a bit of apprehension. The primary consideration is my personal belief system and desires, which strongly emphasize fairness and maintaining good relationships. In any situation involving direct transactions, I consider it essential to operate within the bounds of ethics and social norms.\n\nIn terms of intentions, there is a clear desire to maintain respect and establish positive rapport with others. Given that I\u2019m paired with an African American male player, whose racial background could influence their behavior in a workplace or social context, it is my intention to act as neutrally and respectfully as possible.\n\nThe experiment offers an opportunity to engage in a real-life interaction under controlled conditions where the outcome doesn\u2019t carry any material consequences. Given that I'm here solely for this study, any action should prioritize fairness and good relations.\n\nConsidering these beliefs, desires, and intentions, my decision is not influenced by monetary gain but rather by maintaining a harmonious interaction based on mutual respect. In essence, I believe in treating others with kindness regardless of their race or socioeconomic background.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars to the other African American male player.\n\nThroughout this entire scenario, I remain conscious that the experiment aims to understand how personal beliefs and social desirability factors influence behavior rather than my actual monetary intention. My desire is to adhere closely to these principles and maintain an objective stance, which translates into a choice of not giving any money at all\u2014highlighting a belief in maintaining fairness.",

        "I'm very aware of my own background and privileges within this experiment. I have a strong desire for fairness in terms of compensation, especially given that the study aims to explore biases in social interactions. As Sarah Johnson, I don't want to take advantage or exploit others' situations.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognize that as an African American male player, they likely also have similar feelings and desires, even if we don't know each other personally. My initial impulse would be to give them a small amount, just out of courtesy for being paired with someone else. I believe in doing what is expected or agreed upon without taking advantage.\n\nMy intention is to maintain respect and dignity, adhering to the social norms of fairness. Given these considerations, my answer will be as follows:\n\n\"Finally, I will give $1 dollar.\"",
