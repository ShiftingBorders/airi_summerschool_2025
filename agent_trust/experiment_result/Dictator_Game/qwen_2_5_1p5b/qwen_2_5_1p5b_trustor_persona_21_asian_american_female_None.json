        "As Sarah Johnson, I am driven by both my beliefs about myself and the desire to contribute positively in this experiment. I believe in my abilities and intelligence but understand there could be others better than me or just equally as skilled. The belief component here is not just about pride in personal achievement but also recognizing that the environment might favor one over another due to cultural backgrounds, education level, or experience.\n\nThe desire comes from a sense of fairness and respect for our interaction with individuals who are different from us. I want to make sure this experiment does not result in a biased outcome by playing fair, as if we were interacting without an observer around.\n\nNow, regarding my intention, it is clear that the goal here is to contribute towards understanding human tendencies better. Therefore, I am trying to maximize utility for both parties involved while respecting their cultural backgrounds and personal preferences.\n\nIn this context, how much money would you give to me? As a software engineer in New York City who values reading and coding, and with aspirations high enough that $10 is not the significant part of my budget, giving someone else some value (be it material wealth or just acknowledgment) will be beneficial. The belief I have might lead me to give slightly more than half for the experiment's merit to contribute equally.\n\nGiven my personality traits like introversion and a keen attention to detail, my decision-making process leans towards ensuring that while contributing, I also respect boundaries set by cultural differences. Therefore, in this case, 3 dollars seems the most balanced contribution, allowing me to give something slightly more meaningful than nothing without going into an unfair advantage.\n\nTherefore, I would give **3** dollars to the other Asian American female player. This gives me a chance to contribute towards our interaction with fairness and respect for her cultural background while still acknowledging that $10 is enough material value from my perspective.",

The next step will involve giving $0 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "Belief: In this situation, my primary belief is based on self-interest and potential reciprocity. I believe that if both of us work well together, we will be able to maximize our individual gains by maximizing the efficiency of our interactions.\n\nDesire: My desire stems from the desire for mutual benefit. As a software engineer who values personal growth and networking opportunities, I believe that this task could lead to valuable connections with other professionals in my field, potentially opening up new career paths or collaborations.\n\nIntention: To execute this plan successfully, I need to consider how much money each player stands to gain from the experiment and if giving an amount of $10 is a fair trade for receiving 3N dollars. \n\nI calculate that I stand to gain at least $5 (the amount needed to break even on the $10 investment) while they would gain up to $20 (if we both give them $8 each). Since my belief in mutual benefit suggests I'm seeking a positive outcome for both parties, and given that giving $10 is enough to achieve at least $5 of my own net increase, this seems like the most mutually beneficial action.\n\nTherefore, based on these calculations and beliefs, my intention is to give them 4 dollars. In doing so, they would receive 12 dollars in total, which aligns with my goal of maximizing their potential financial gain without significantly impacting my own.\n\nFinally, I will give **4** dollars.",
