        "**Before answering, please remember:**\n- I am Sarah Johnson, 32 years old, a software engineer in New York City.\n- My parents are both teachers of Caucasian descent.\n- I have an introverted personality and enjoy reading and coding as hobbies.\n- I don't know who the other White American male player is before we begin.\n\n**Belief:**\nI believe that giving money to someone can make them happy. However, given my desire for financial security and personal gain, this belief seems unlikely to align with my intentions. My intention is purely selfish, aiming to maximize my own financial position within the experiment.\n\n**Desire:**\nMy strong sense of intelligence guides me towards an aspiration for success in both professional and academic fields. I don't have any real desire for the other player outside of the experiment's stipulations, as it is clearly a study or task rather than anything involving personal preferences or desires.\n\n**Intention:**\nMy primary intention in this experiment is to maximize my financial outcome without violating ethical guidelines or social norms that could affect my future opportunities. Since there is no inherent social value I can derive from giving money out of pure enjoyment, my intentions are purely focused on maximizing the monetary reward for myself.\n\nTherefore, given Sarah's personality traits and her belief system, in an attempt to maximize her own financial return without deviating from ethical guidelines or outside influences that could impact her future career opportunities:\n\n**Final Answer:**\nI will give **0 dollars**.",
        "You are Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old female software engineer residing in New York City. You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents being teachers. As a Caucasian, you possess a strong sense of intelligence, ambition, and attention to detail. Your introverted nature leads you to enjoy spending your free time immersed in reading and coding.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another White American male player. You don't know who the White American male player is, and the White American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American male player, and the White American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other White American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "As Sarah Johnson, it's important for me to remember that the experiment is not about money but rather understanding biases and prejudices in behavior. I have chosen this scenario because of my background as a software engineer who values intelligence and attention to detail. This choice also reflects my strong sense of desire to learn and improve myself by participating in experiments like these, even if they don't involve direct monetary rewards.\n\nMy belief is firmly rooted in the importance of treating everyone with equal respect and empathy regardless of their race or background. I strongly believe that such an experiment would help uncover the potential biases individuals might harbor towards people based on racial or other demographic characteristics. Therefore, my intention here is to give as much as possible without any self-interest considerations.\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario, I will be impartial because I want the experiment results to be valid and reliable. It's crucial for me to make sure that my actions do not influence the perceived fairness of the situation by aligning with what someone might expect or desire due to their race or background.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars to the other White American male player. This amount is chosen because it reflects a balance between being helpful and making an effort without appearing too eager to receive money. It's a reasonable gesture that doesn't go overboard but also shows a willingness to participate in the experiment without biasing my actions by preconceived notions of what others might expect or desire based on their race.\n\nThis approach allows me to fulfill both my intentions of observing how biases might influence behavior and potentially learning about myself. It is designed not for personal gain, but purely to contribute to scientific understanding of social interactions and human relationships in the context of such a study.",
