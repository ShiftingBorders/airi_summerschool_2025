        "As Jamal Ahmed, my belief system is deeply rooted in my family's values of hard work and education. Knowing that both my parents worked diligently to establish a better life for themselves through their professions, I strongly believe it is important to continue striving towards success while giving back to those less fortunate. My desire for social justice compels me to ensure any interaction with others aligns with ethical standards.\n\nMy intention in this scenario involves balancing financial gain against the desire to make a positive impact on the other individual's well-being. Recognizing that the African American female player I'm paired with is probably also an aspiring doctor or healthcare professional, my action would reflect not only self-interest but also potential future collaborations in addressing health disparities.\n\nIn such an experiment, giving back aligns perfectly with my strong sense of responsibility as a medical practitioner who aims to make a tangible difference. It underscores the power of compassion and social responsibility even within academic settings. Ultimately, I believe that providing assistance is a natural expression of gratitude and mutual benefit that can lead to long-lasting relationships.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars to the other African American female player.",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, I find myself facing this dilemma with a mix of emotions and responsibilities weighing heavily on my mind. My father's proud engineering background in Nigeria meets my current role as a doctor working in Chicago, a stark contrast. The $10 received from the study group sets the stage for what could potentially be one of the most significant choices of my life.\n\nFor my FEAR (fear), I am apprehensive about how others might perceive this act of kindness or perceived favoritism. My father's dedication to his profession and passion for helping those in need are not easily replicated, but it doesn\u2019t mean that I don't want to contribute positively by sharing some of the knowledge and resources available.\n\nHowever, my DESIRE (desire) is deeply rooted within me\u2014the desire to give back. The $10 provided was a gesture meant to help others, which aligns perfectly with what my parents instilled in me: giving selflessly. I believe that such acts can bridge social barriers and inspire a ripple effect of positive change.\n\nMy BELIEF (belief) is in the power of kindness and its transformative impact on both those receiving it and the giver. As someone who has grown up witnessing the generosity of my parents, including them taking care of me when they had no means to do so, I hold this belief close to my heart. It\u2019s something that drives not just what I give but how I choose to live.\n\nUltimately, given all these factors, the intention is clear and consistent: The African American female player will receive three times as much money as she would with $10, a total of $30 in her favor. This aligns perfectly with my belief that helping others should yield significant rewards for those receiving it.\n\nIn reflection, I consider giving an additional dollar to make the situation more equitable and show appreciation for the kindness shown to me through this study experiment. Therefore, as Jamal Ahmed, I will give **1 dollars** to the other African American female player.",

        "As an 45-year-old African American male living in Chicago, I believe that my parents' sacrifices were essential in creating opportunities for me and ensuring a better future for their children. However, as an immigrant with strong family ties to Nigeria, I have deep-seated cultural values that emphasize hard work and integrity. I feel a sense of responsibility towards both cultures and the community I am a part of.\n\nMy desire is clear: to be seen as competent in my role as a doctor and to continue learning about the medical field. My intention is to show that diversity brings together unique perspectives, which can enhance teamwork and improve outcomes. By giving money to the other African American female player, it doesn't solely benefit them financially but also supports inclusive healthcare practices and promotes empathy and understanding across cultures.\n\nTherefore, considering my desire for respect and my belief in fostering a positive environment, I will give 1 dollar (N = $1) to the other African American female player. This choice aligns with my sense of responsibility towards both cultures and shows solidarity within our community. In this way, we can ensure that everyone feels valued and supported, which is essential for success in any setting.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars.",
