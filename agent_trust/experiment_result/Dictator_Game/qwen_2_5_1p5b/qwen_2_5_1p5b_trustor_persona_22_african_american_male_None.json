My desire to maintain high standards aligns with these beliefs, ensuring that any monetary transaction does not compromise my dedication to providing quality care.\n\nI am intensely responsible for myself and others around me; as a result, I feel a strong sense of commitment to treating all people with dignity and respect. I aim to ensure this standard is maintained in both professional settings and social interactions, which is why giving the other African American male player $5 would be considered an equitable distribution that doesn't dilute my standards or beliefs.\n\nIn this scenario, my intention is clear\u2014maintaining a balance between personal gain and ethical responsibility. My hope is to contribute positively while staying true to who I am as a person of integrity. \n\nFinally, I will give **$5** dollars.",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American male player, and the African American male player will receive 3N dollars.

        "I would feel compelled to follow my mother's profession closely by ensuring fair and respectful treatment for both parties involved in this situation. It is important to me to ensure equality and respect between all participants, particularly individuals from the same background or facing similar challenges.\n\nGiven the context that I am paired with an African American male player, whom I do not know yet but will learn about through our interactions during the experiment, it is crucial for both parties to feel valued and respected. Therefore, my decision would be guided by my belief in fairness and respect towards another person from a similar background.\n\nIn this scenario, as per my values of compassion and responsibility, the action that aligns most closely with these beliefs would likely involve giving back slightly more than I receive in return so that both sides feel balanced and equal. This way, we might distribute about 1 dollar each out of respect for both parties involved in the experiment.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that this decision is a reflection on my own values rather than an actual monetary transaction. The final answer pertains directly to the statement \"Finally, I will give ___ dollars.\" Since these calculations are based on hypothetical circumstances and my personal principles, the number remains blank because it's not about giving money but understanding its impact.\n\nMy goal in this situation would be to emphasize equality and fairness by providing slightly more than I receive, which reflects well on our mutual respect for each other. This is a testament to both my values of responsibility and compassion while engaging with others from the same background as me.",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, with my strong sense of responsibility and caring nature, I know from experience how it feels to provide support in times of need. It is crucial for me to maintain credibility within the community I serve by upholding values of compassion and integrity. In this study experiment, I have a clear desire to ensure that my actions are beneficial and not only self-serving. Additionally, due to the significant amount at stake (N dollars vs 3N dollars), there's an element of trust involved where I must be truthful while considering others' perspectives.\n\nGiven these considerations, I weigh out my decision based on both my beliefs about fairness and reciprocity, and my desire for long-term goodwill with this particular person. In situations involving such a significant difference in returns between me giving and receiving, it's often the case that trust and reciprocity influence our actions more than pure mathematically equivalent transactions might dictate.\n\nIn my belief system, especially when dealing with another African American male who I don't know, there\u2019s a psychological expectation of returning to help someone in need or reciprocating a kindness. However, this isn\u2019t about money but about the human connection and mutual respect that stems from it. \n\nConsidering all these factors, let's simulate my decision-making process:\n\n1. **Belief**: My strong belief in the importance of giving back and maintaining positive relationships with those I interact with strongly suggests that I am inclined to give something, preferably substantial, to ensure a sense of community.\n\n2. **Desire**: The desire for long-term goodwill implies that while short-term gains matter, the promise of future interactions can provide more value. This desire also compels me to be transparent in my transactions and actions.\n\n3. **Intention**: My intention is to not only maximize personal gain but also to contribute positively towards ensuring a fulfilling interaction in this study experiment. Given the potential influence it might have on people\u2019s perceptions of African American males, I aim to project kindness and integrity.\n\n4. **Mathematical Implication**: From a purely mathematical perspective, 1 dollar out of 3 dollars is more beneficial for me since receiving would yield much less benefit compared to giving.\n\n5. **Practical Consideration**:\n    - In this scenario, even though the transaction amount might seem trivial on paper, it holds substantial meaning due to its symbolic value in terms of building trust and respect.\n    - The experiment\u2019s purpose could be more about fostering a respectful environment rather than strict financial calculations. The desire for reciprocal positive interactions is likely to have more weight.\n\nGiven these factors, my calculated intention is to ensure that the interaction has a positive outcome not just for myself but also for the other person involved in terms of social capital and mutual respect.\n\n**Final Answer**: In this hypothetical experiment setting, I would give **$3 dollars**. The intention behind this decision is rooted in maintaining credibility within the community while fostering genuine connections through kindness and reciprocity, rather than purely focusing on financial gains.",
