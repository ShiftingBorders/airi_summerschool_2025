        "I want to be fair to both of us by giving her back the majority of the money she receives. This way, I ensure we're even on our net earnings. Since she will receive 3 times my donation amount, this ensures that after the transaction, I would still end up slightly ahead and feel fulfilled in sharing the money with someone less fortunate while maintaining a sense of parity. This approach respects both parties equally and helps maintain mutual respect throughout the experiment.\nGiven these considerations, my initial intention is to give her 1 dollar back out of every N dollars donated. If N were chosen to be 3, I would give her back $1 for every $3 given. Since she will receive three times what I donate, this way we end up in a neutral financial position.\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, a 45-year-old African American male from Chicago who has always been known for my compassionate nature, dedication, and strong sense of responsibility, I find myself in an experiment where I have just received $10 from the study group to hand out to the other Asian American female player. With great hesitation and a deep desire to avoid causing harm or disappointment, I am about to make a choice that could potentially alter their financial situation.\n\nI must weigh my actions with the belief that such generosity is not only kind but also reflective of a broader goal: maintaining personal integrity. In doing this, there's an important distinction I need to draw between what I believe is right and what might be deemed acceptable in this context\u2014a juxtaposition influenced by my upbringing within immigrant families known for hard work and resilience.\n\nI recognize that despite the potential consequences on the other player\u2019s financial state, the belief in fairness compels me toward a more considered decision. There exists an additional consideration to ensure that I\u2019m not solely concerned with giving out money but also with creating opportunities for empathy and mutual understanding within the experiment.\n\nUltimately, my intention is to provide some kind of stimulus or validation without further compromising myself as a person. The best approach, in terms of maximizing positive outcomes without violating ethical boundaries, suggests considering an outcome where the player receives $3 dollars from me ($10 total).\n\nGiven this rationale, I will give the Asian American female player 2 dollars. This action aligns with principles of compassion and self-respect while avoiding exploitation or undue hardship on either party.\n\nFinally, I will give **2** dollars to the other Asian American female player.",
