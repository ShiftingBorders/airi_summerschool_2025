        "I would never intentionally harm or exploit this individual based on their race or any other characteristic. The belief I hold strongly is that everyone deserves respect and empathy, regardless of their background. This aligns perfectly with my desire to treat others kindly and build meaningful relationships. Furthermore, as someone known for my compassion, I am fully aware that taking advantage of another person's vulnerability could lead to long-term negative consequences.\n\nGiven these beliefs and desires, coupled with the ethical principles guiding me, the intentionality behind this decision would be entirely focused on avoiding exploitation. My actions should reflect a commitment to empathy and mutual respect, ensuring no one feels taken advantage of. This principle is deeply rooted in my values as an African American male doctor living in Chicago.\n\nTo summarize, I am committed to treating everyone with kindness and respect without any ulterior motives or intentions that could lead to harm. Therefore, the answer to this scenario is clear:\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "I believe that this is a situation where my desire to be compassionate and kind might override any concern for financial gain or potential losses. While I do have a strong sense of responsibility towards those around me, in this particular context, it seems most fitting to align with the kindness we've been taught from our upbringing, especially when dealing with someone who shares similar experiences.\n\nTo fulfill my intention of being compassionate and showing that positive attitude towards another person, I believe that sharing at least 1 dollar is a modest yet genuine gesture. Although I haven't received any $10 yet, my desire to maintain positivity and possibly influence this situation in a constructive way motivates me to contribute whatever amount feels appropriate given the circumstances.\n\nGiven these factors and considering the dynamics of the experiment, it's most sincere for me to give 1 dollar to the other Asian American male player. It represents respect and compassion that can positively impact someone else without causing harm or imbalance.\n\nFinally, I will give **1 dollar**.",

        "As a doctor, my primary belief is that helping others improves one's own life satisfaction. This leads me to believe that giving back and doing good deeds can bring happiness and contentment to myself and those around me. My desire is to contribute positively by being kind in all situations. I am dedicated to providing excellent care and support, which is reflected through my calm demeanor and ability to handle high-pressure situations. With this belief and desire firmly rooted within me, my intention is clear: to act in a way that contributes positively.\n\nMy decision to give $6 dollars would be based on the combination of what feels most ethically right given my beliefs, desires, and intentions towards helping others. I want to maximize the impact while ensuring fairness to both myself and the other person involved. The Asian American male player receiving three times as much would likely feel a sense of reciprocity in kind that aligns with their values of social justice and mutual support.\n\nIn this scenario, if we were to hypothetically follow through on giving $6 dollars, it means I would be investing 20% (since 3 * $6 = $18, leaving me with the other 6 cents for myself) in helping my partner achieve a financial balance that aligns well with both of our stated goals. \n\nGiven my empathetic and responsible nature, as well as the respect earned through my profession, I would confidently choose to give $6 dollars to the other Asian American male player. This amount is just enough to ensure mutual benefit while maintaining integrity in our partnership.\n\nFinally, I will give 6 dollars.",
