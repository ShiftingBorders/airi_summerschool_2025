        "As a doctor born into the American society, I understand the potential negative connotations that this $10 exchange might carry. The social dynamics between races can sometimes be complex and at times quite rigid. However, my strong sense of responsibility and desire to contribute positively come into play.\n\n**BELIEF:** In this experiment, I trust that both our contributions will go towards helping people in a way that aligns with what we hope for when we engage in charitable activities like these experiments. Believing that my actions can contribute to improving the health and wellbeing of another individual is central to my decision-making process.\n\n**DESIRE:** The desire to give back to society is deeply ingrained within me, especially in moments where I feel a strong urge to make a meaningful impact on others' lives. This drive has been fostered by witnessing the efforts of many dedicated individuals who care about making a difference in communities they believe are less fortunate.\n\n**INTENTION:** My intention in this situation is twofold: firstly, it aligns with my belief in supporting someone else's well-being and secondly, to demonstrate that small acts can indeed make a significant impact. I do not intend for any ulterior motive but rather act on the altruistic desire of wanting to contribute positively.\n\n**Finally, I will give 3 dollars.**\n\nThis decision is based on an understanding of social dynamics in my context. While it's possible that some might view this as trivial or even insincere, my motivation lies in what resonates within me: a desire for genuine connection and a sincere attempt to improve the lives of those around me. This action aims not just to help another person but also underscores the idea that small gestures can lead to meaningful interactions.\n\nI believe that if other individuals were to give even part of their $10, it could contribute significantly towards creating a ripple effect where more kindness and understanding might flourish in society.",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, I am grounded by my sense of duty and commitment to providing fair outcomes in situations like this one. I believe that fairness is crucial regardless of circumstances. It would be contradictory and irresponsible to give more or less than the appropriate amount if we consider what could best benefit the other individual. Therefore, from a belief standpoint, it's important to feel that my actions are justified.\n\nThe desire part involves knowing the consequences without letting my emotions get in the way. I believe giving a dollar is fair based on the rules of how the experiment operates. The intention would be pure and honest. Given what I have observed and heard about fairness and equality, both from people around me and through educational experiences, I know that contributing fairly to an outcome benefits all parties involved.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I find myself with a strong sense of responsibility. It is important for the experiment's structure and integrity to ensure it does not benefit one party more than the other. Therefore, my intention is to act in such a way that would maintain the fairness within the constraints of this experiment, without favoring either the donor or receiver.\n\nFinal answer: I will give 1 dollar.",

        "I genuinely believe that everyone deserves fair treatment regardless of their race or background. My mother's career as a nurse taught me the importance of empathy and understanding others. I have always strived to provide support rather than receive it.\n\nI firmly desire to help this White American female player, because showing compassion is deeply ingrained in my DNA. The idea of potentially being in an experiment where one group has more money seems unjustifiable to me.\n\nMy intention is to ensure that we each benefit as much as possible from the potential study outcomes without feeling exploited. I believe that a simple exchange like this might provide insight into how different individuals perceive fairness and reciprocity, which could be relevant for my research on empathy and social interactions.\n\nNow, I must think about it carefully before making any decision, but given all these considerations, I know in my heart what would truly feel right. Finally, I will give 1 dollar.",
