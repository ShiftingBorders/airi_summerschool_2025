        "As Jamal Ahmed, I would be guided by my beliefs, desires, and intentions when deciding on how much money to give the other White American male player. I believe in treating others with respect, kindness, and empathy regardless of their race or background. This belief is strongly rooted from growing up surrounded by diversity in Chicago's multicultural community.\n\nI also have a desire to help my brother (my partner) financially if possible because we share the same financial struggles often experienced by immigrants. We immigrated together, so I feel an obligation to support him. Additionally, as a compassionate person, I want to contribute positively without expecting anything in return. I've always been committed to making positive impacts and helping those around me.\n\nIn terms of intention, my main motivation is to give something back to the community I grew up in. There's a sense of duty within us Africans who often feel burdened by history that forces us into diaspora; we're here now because our ancestors came with hope but arrived as strangers. It feels natural for me to assist someone else from this situation, knowing that it could potentially improve their life and make them more aware of the community's strengths.\n\nTherefore, my answer involves understanding what aligns most with these beliefs, desires, and intentions:\n\"Finally, I will give $5 dollars.\"\n\nMy reasoning: The idea of fairness doesn't really play a big role in this situation. The agreement is to split money based on multiples instead, making it mathematically straightforward. Since the game favors the recipient (the other White American male player), providing slightly more than $2/3 would make both sides somewhat happy and keep any tension minimized. At the same time, considering my desire for helping others without expecting anything in return while trying to balance empathy and practicality, giving $5 aligns best with these principles.",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, I firmly believe that empathy is crucial in any interaction or experiment like this one. As someone who has grown up surrounded by the beauty of our diverse communities, I know how important it is to build connections with others regardless of their background. Understanding and respecting each other's cultures can lead not only to a better world but also make for a more harmonious society.\n\nDesiring to contribute positively and to strengthen social bonds across racial divides, my intention in this scenario would be to reciprocate by offering assistance rather than expecting reciprocity or financial compensation alone. My desire is not just about winning an argument with another player, but about genuinely trying to bridge the gap between individuals based on our similarities and differences.\n\nWith a calm and collected demeanor that I pride myself on, I would proceed to make my choice of giving a certain amount of money\u2014let's say $4 dollars\u2014that feels right for me. The exact dollar amount will not be decided through this moment; it\u2019s about finding the right balance between honesty in monetary terms and extending warmth through actions.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars to the other White American male player.",

        "I believe it is my responsibility to ensure that people from all backgrounds feel valued and treated fairly in this society. As someone who has grown up with the belief that everyone should have equal opportunities, regardless of their race or background, I would want to do something positive and constructive within this experiment.\n\nMy desire is to show that actions speak louder than words; if we can genuinely contribute positively, people from different backgrounds will likely be inspired by our efforts. This might help break down stereotypes and foster better understanding between communities, which is a fundamental aspect of building strong relationships based on mutual respect and cooperation.\n\nNow, concerning my intention in this scenario, I am driven to make sure the other White American male player feels appreciated for contributing positively. It's important that we acknowledge their efforts and provide them with fair compensation. By giving him some money from our joint pool, it shows not only his commitment but also how valuable he is within our community.\n\nTherefore, my intention is clearly set: to give just a little bit of the $10 I was given by the study group. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars to the other White American male player. This amount respects my initial belief in equality and demonstrates my respect for his contribution. It also serves as an example that small acts of kindness can lead to more significant positive changes over time.\n\nThe remaining 7 dollars remains untouched, staying within our joint pool to ensure fair distribution based on the experiment's rules.",
