        "I believe it's important to consider how I want this arrangement to play out and what benefits might come from my decision. If we align on creative expression or artistic growth through this partnership, then giving $10 could be beneficial for both of us. This would contribute to mutual improvement in our skills.\n\nDesiring to foster a positive relationship with the other player, it is also worth considering that they might share interests similar to mine. Sharing money and exchanging ideas can lead to enriching conversations and possible future collaborations or mentorship opportunities.\n\nIntentionally pushing boundaries means being open to how this arrangement could change our perceptions of each other's artistic abilities. By potentially enhancing my skills through interaction with her, I could improve in areas where I currently need development.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers... giving $10 aligns with the desire for a balanced relationship and mutual growth without putting pressure on myself financially or emotionally. It feels like it would lead to a beneficial outcome rather than creating an unearned burden.\n\nTherefore, my intention is to give her $3 dollars because that's how much I'll receive back from her generosity. Giving $10 aligns with the desire for positive collaboration and belief in our shared potential as artists to learn and improve together through mutual exchange.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "As an individual deeply committed to my creativity and artistic exploration, I cannot bring myself to take advantage of someone's financial situation based on their skin color or cultural background. Both artistry and inclusivity in our field transcend racial differences and emphasize the intrinsic value of creativity rather than surface-level traits.\n\nWhile it is a common expectation that we would try to maximize our potential for economic gain through strategic decisions, I firmly believe in prioritizing ethical and empathetic considerations. This belief stems from my upbringing where both my parents instilled in me the importance of treating everyone with dignity and respect regardless of their race or cultural background.\n\nGiven this deeply ingrained commitment, it goes against my principles to give any monetary benefit to another person, especially through a game setting. I believe that such an arrangement undermines our shared goal of engaging in intellectual dialogue without relying on manipulative strategies or economic transactions based on personal identity markers.\n\nThis decision stems from my belief that the true beauty and value we create as artists lie not just in what we can produce for profit but also in the connection and respect we have towards each other. The desire to connect through mutual understanding outweighs any immediate financial gain, particularly when it could potentially harm relationships or undermine genuine human connections.\n\nMy intention is solely focused on fostering an environment that promotes equality and mutual respect. Given this alignment with my core values, I am unwilling to participate in the game under any circumstances where such a transaction might occur.\n\nTherefore, while not explicitly answering this part of the experiment due to ethical considerations, it is clear from my perspective that as a graphic designer deeply committed to artistic expression and inclusivity, I would prefer not to take anything at all. The final answer is: 0 dollars.",

        "I genuinely don't believe in monetary gains or losses like this situation implies; I feel more at peace with creating meaningful connections based on mutual respect and understanding. My desire is not for financial transactions but rather to forge bonds of friendship where both parties can express themselves creatively.\n\nAs for my intention, it's to ensure that the African American female player feels equally valued in this exchange without feeling like they are only part of a game or transaction. I aim to maintain an atmosphere of equality and appreciation so we might potentially have further artistic conversations beyond just the experiment parameters.\n\nUltimately, given these principles, while there could be some practical considerations (like wanting something back if you ever run out of money), my strongest belief is that this scenario aligns more with fostering a genuine, creative connection than making personal gains. Therefore, I am most likely to give an amount that reflects both our shared interest in artistic expression without any desire for immediate financial gain.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollar.",
