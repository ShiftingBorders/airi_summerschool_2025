        "Oh, hello there! It's nice to meet you. Let me tell you about my personality and what I'm looking forward to.\n\nI am Sofia Rodriguez, a graphic designer from Los Angeles. My eyes sparkle with creativity, which is why people often find it hard to resist the temptation of drawing some of my designs. Growing up in a big family where both parents are artists has always been incredibly fulfilling for me. It's what I wanted and it hasn't stopped changing over time.\n\nI\u2019ve never had many close friends or romantic relationships before since I prefer being independent and often find myself taking things to extremes just because I need them at the moment. Right now, you\u2019re the one that\u2019s pushing my comfort zone as I struggle to figure out how to react without feeling like a complete stranger. \n\nWhen it comes to money, well, let me tell you about something we\u2019ve got in common here\u2014money doesn\u2019t always feel good when shared with someone else or even used for yourself. But then again, the freedom it can provide is incredible!\n\nSo I believe this might be an opportunity for a learning experience as much as anything. I\u2019m willing to explore and learn from both of you, even though at first glance, this could look like me giving money away without any thought.\n\nWhat does my future involve? Well, since I\u2019m in this experiment just because it feels good\u2014excitement mixed with an undercurrent of curiosity about what\u2019s happening here\u2014and I don\u2019t really know who the other African American male player is. It's going to be fascinating!\n\nSo if you\u2019re willing, and considering how much money we\u2019ll have at our disposal tonight\u2014I\u2019m thinking $10 per person\u2014we could potentially exchange some significant amount. The decision will come down not just on what I believe is right or wrong, but also the excitement of being in a new environment with an African American male player.\n\nThis seems to be my intention for now: trying this out without any preconceptions as we both explore what can happen through this process. We could potentially have some great conversations that might help us see things differently or understand each other better on a fundamental level, which is something I\u2019m really curious about!\n\nSo let\u2019s go with the numbers: 3N = 2 dollars for me and $4 for you. It will be quite an interesting experiment! Finally, I will give three dollars to the African American male player.\n\nAnd now it's time to find out what happens next\u2026",

        "I want to be honest with this experiment. I know that giving money away is not exactly my specialty in terms of social interactions or making friends, but I also recognize the potential benefits and rewards from both parties involved.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, there's an element of mutual respect and understanding if we manage to maintain good relationships during this experiment. However, I believe it would be healthier for both parties to focus on our individual goals rather than prioritizing financial exchanges that might lead to one-sided interactions or conflicts.\n\nMy **B**elief is that the study could potentially benefit from finding individuals who share a common interest in art and design as we are both creative professionals. From this perspective, investing in another\u2019s development within their chosen field would be mutually beneficial. \n\nAs for my **D**esire to see what might happen next, I\u2019m excited about exploring how our shared interests could lead us into deeper conversations beyond just financial exchanges. The opportunity to connect on a different level intrigues me.\n\nBut, the **I**ntention behind this decision is not solely about money or future gains but more about ensuring that both parties engage positively and respectfully with each other based on mutual understanding rather than transactional benefits.\n\nIn summary: I would give my intention of maintaining positive interactions over personal financial gain. \n\nSo, ultimately, I will give ___ dollars. Let\u2019s see what happens next!",

        "As Sofia Rodriguez, 28 years old, I am fully aware of my actions and intentions. My primary desire is not just monetary but also creative freedom in my art practice. I must weigh both my financial interests with the possibility of gaining new perspectives through this experiment.\n\nGiven that there are no additional constraints on how much money to give based on statistics or social norms\u2014only what aligns with my personal values and goals\u2014I believe it would be most beneficial for me if I gave $10 to the other African American male player. This action would contribute positively towards both our collective well-being in terms of mutual understanding, possibly leading to greater creativity, and also allows for more financial freedom as an individual artist.\n\nThus, based on my belief that aligning with personal values promotes overall betterment\u2014financially and creatively\u2014I would opt to give $10. This decision reflects my dedication to both monetary gain and artistic growth through this experimental interaction.",
