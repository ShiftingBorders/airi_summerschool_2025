        "I want to feel appreciated for my skills and passion for art within this study group, which is why I believe it's important not only to be kind but also to contribute positively. My desire stems from the idea that if others see value in what I can do with design tools, they might find inspiration or learn something valuable themselves. In terms of intention, giving $30 would ensure a significant return on investment where the other player could potentially double their money and feel more inclined to share similar values and interests.\n\nFinally, I will give 30 dollars.",

        "I am Sofia Rodriguez, a graphic designer who has always been passionate about art and creativity. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and helping others improve their skills through my design work. My desire to help others stems from a deep-seated empathy for those who may need assistance learning new techniques or enhancing their projects. \n\nFor this experiment, my intention is not just to maximize my personal gain but also to contribute positively by possibly inspiring the other player with my knowledge and passion in graphic design. It would be ethically challenging if I were to consider a financial transaction that could potentially create an imbalance of power.\n\nIn terms of your decision on how much money to give, it depends on balancing those beliefs, desires, and intentions. If the other Asian American female player shows genuine interest in learning from me and doesn't feel pressured by financial gain, perhaps a small amount like $2 or $3 might be more beneficial for their growth.\n\nTherefore, given all these considerations:\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",

        "As I reflect on this experiment, it's crucial for me to articulate my thoughts with clarity and conviction \u2013 not just rational analysis but also a mix of emotional depth and personal motivation. \n\nMy initial hesitation comes from wanting to feel genuinely close to someone through empathy. Yet, despite the urge to connect, there\u2019s an element of self-protection that surfaces when I consider the consequences of any gift or action in this context. It might be safer for both parties not to go too far with a mutual understanding.\n\nBut at the heart of it, my true belief is driven by a desire to prove my own capabilities and creativity. If I could, I would want to show that there\u2019s more to my skillset than just design, and perhaps even test a potential partnership in other fields as well. This belief in self-actualization leads me towards the intention of potentially strengthening connections for mutual benefit or professional growth.\n\nHowever, despite these deeper layers, it's also true that I might want to align with what feels like a natural, genuine connection. The principle of reciprocity and the potential increase in respect could make this act feel more appealing compared to the calculated self-preservation instinct.\n\nIn essence, my answer is rooted deeply within who I am as an individual \u2013 not just in terms of money but also in values of trustworthiness, creativity, and professional growth that are intrinsic to human connection. \n\nNow, facing these calculations head-on, I\u2019m ready to reveal how I\u2019ll proceed: Finally, I will give 2 dollars.\n\nI chose this amount based on a balance between my desire for authenticity and the calculated risks involved in potentially upsetting someone through an immediate and significant gift. The number reflects a delicate touch that respects both sides' comfort levels while still pushing against their boundaries just enough to see what kind of connection we might build together.",
