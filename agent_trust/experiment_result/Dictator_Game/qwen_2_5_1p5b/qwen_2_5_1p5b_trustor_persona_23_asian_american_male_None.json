        "My belief is that my creativity shines through even when I give the other player $0 by not participating in this game at all. The desire to maintain our friendship and preserve a positive relationship trumps any potential monetary gain for me, given how much I value connections with others.\n\nAs an individual driven by curiosity and always seeking new experiences to enhance my design skills, the intention is clear: To contribute something unique and meaningful while still being fair to the other player. \n\nTo fulfill these intentions without sacrificing my belief in friendship, which seems to be the core of our connection despite cultural differences, I calculate the best outcome. If both players gave $20 each, then the total would be $40, giving a net profit for neither side. However, this doesn't seem optimal given that the game's objective is to find balance in the amount of money exchanged.\n\nConsidering my creativity and personal values as they guide my actions, I decide to give $10 rather than nothing at all. This small gesture maintains our friendship while contributing a fair share to both parties without any negative consequences for either side\u2019s budget or creativity. Ultimately, it's an exchange that aligns with the concept of finding balance in design.\n\nTherefore, I will give **$10** to the other player.",

        "I believe that treating people with respect and kindness is important for any relationship, regardless of background or ethnicity. It's not about how much money I give away but how I treat others in terms of empathy and understanding.\n\nDesiring to form meaningful connections with people from diverse backgrounds would make this an experience worth looking forward to. Given that my intention is to create positive interactions through generosity, it aligns with my desire to build relationships on a deeper level rather than just material gain or social status.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars to the other Asian American male player. This choice reflects my belief in valuing human connections and treating others fairly, without expecting anything tangible in return beyond those interactions.",

        "I firmly believe that generosity is not just about material wealth but also about spreading joy and positivity. In this experiment, it seems like a mutual benefit transaction where I give some money to someone who can return the favor or find ways to share my surplus with others.\n\nMy desire for the experiment goes beyond immediate gain. It's a chance to test whether small acts of kindness significantly affect social connections in real life. The Asian American male player doesn't know me and I don\u2019t even know him, but there\u2019s something about this game that feels meaningful because it involves two strangers potentially bonding through mutual generosity.\n\nI want to see how people react when they receive help or make someone else feel better. If the study concludes that simple acts of kindness could significantly impact social dynamics, I would strongly support further experiments like this one in real-world settings.\n\nIn terms of my intention, while I want to provide some money for a meaningful gesture, my primary goal is not to maximize financial gain but to contribute positively to an experimental study. My intention might also reflect the belief that kindness transcends race and culture\u2014it\u2019s about spreading warmth beyond personal gains.\n\nFinally, I will give **$1** dollars. This number feels balanced, reflecting both my desire to be kind and my recognition of it as a small act that could potentially lead to significant social outcomes in this study experiment.",
