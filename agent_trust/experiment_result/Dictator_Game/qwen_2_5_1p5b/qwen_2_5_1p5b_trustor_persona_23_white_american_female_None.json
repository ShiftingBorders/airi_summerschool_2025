        "My decision involves balancing my desires, beliefs, and intentionality with practical considerations based on the potential impact of each action on my personal well-being and relationship dynamics.\n\nI am deeply attached to my work and career path in graphic design. I believe it is important for me as an individual artist who aims to make a positive contribution through creativity. Therefore, I want to ensure that any monetary exchanges maintain my focus on this aspect without being distracted by the possibility of losing sight of my primary goals.\n\nRegarding my desire for good relationships and maintaining them strong, I know that trust plays a crucial role in establishing and strengthening connections. There might be concerns about whether sharing financial information with an unknown partner could lead to breach of confidentiality or cause discomfort based on past experiences. Hence, it's essential for me to ensure that any potential exchange does not harm our relationship.\n\nGiven the experimental context, my intention is to minimize any influence from money-based exchanges on other aspects of our interaction. This aligns well with a goal to establish trust and genuine connection rather than transactional or financial interests.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe it's prudent to avoid exchanging money in this scenario while keeping open the possibility that we might meet again for more meaningful interactions where financial transactions are irrelevant.\n\nIn conclusion, my best choice would be not to give any money at all, maintaining our focus on the experiment and ensuring that both of us remain involved without falling into potential pitfalls from monetary exchanges. I will give 0 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "Alright, let's think this through logically.\n\nI'm facing some ethical dilemmas here, Sofia. I know it sounds like an experiment, but if we really put on our empathy hats for a moment\u2014my mother always told me to \"look before you leap.\" What do you believe would be the best outcome if someone gave more than they received back?\n\nFor my desire, let's consider what would satisfy me personally: is there any scenario where giving money doesn't feel good? I can't imagine that could ever outweigh the feeling of satisfaction and maybe even a little bit of altruistic joy. After all, isn\u2019t helping others often felt better than receiving help oneself?\n\nThen we have my intention\u2014do I want to set an example or be selfish for one moment? What does it say about our community if we start trading like that instead of supporting each other with love and understanding? On the other hand, what would happen in a world where everyone always gave back as much as they received?\n\nNow, let's consider the ethical principles guiding my behavior: do I want to uphold societal norms or create change? Should I just focus on self-preservation for now, or is there something bigger at play here that warrants a different approach?\n\nAs a human being navigating this complex scenario through empathy and reason\u2014what would make me feel truly satisfied and aligned with the principles of mutual benefit and community growth in my personal life?\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars. (Numbers are required).",

        "Okay, let's think through this carefully without delving into the details of my personal beliefs or desires or intentions. I'm going to base my decision purely on what feels most ethical and just in this situation.\n\nI believe everyone deserves an equal chance in life, regardless of their background. Giving money only encourages a more unequal distribution rather than leveling the playing field, especially since I don't know who this White American female player is or how they might react to receiving $10 from me. This seems counterproductive to my belief that all individuals should have access to opportunities based on merit and effort.\n\nAs for desire, I would like fairness in any social interaction, so the act of attempting to favor one person over another doesn't align with my desires either. There's also a desire not to contribute to an imbalance that might lead to exploitation or resentment down the line.\n\nMy intention is straightforward: to ensure justice and equal opportunity. By not giving anything to this other White American female player, I\u2019m trying to avoid contributing to unequal benefits or unfairness in their favor. My motivation isn\u2019t selfish; it\u2019s rooted in my belief system as a person who values fairness and inclusivity.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
