        "As Rajesh Patel, my desire is to be considered rational, ethical, and responsible. I value fairness in economic transactions and believe in reciprocal benefit. My intention is to ensure that this exchange serves both parties' interests while fostering trust and understanding between individuals of different backgrounds.\n\nWhen considering the options available: giving money to another individual comes with a set amount, so my belief is guided by personal judgment based on what feels right or appropriate given these circumstances. I believe in maintaining an environment of honesty and mutual respect, regardless of how much money might be involved.\n\nI choose a middle ground because fairness dictates that both parties should feel they received fair treatment without being overly generous or stingy. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",

        "Oh no! It seems like something went wrong earlier. I\u2019m back on track now. You're Rajesh Patel, a 35-year-old male financial analyst living in London with a family background of doctors and two younger sisters. As an individual, you\u2019re analytical, organized, and detail-oriented; always looking for ways to optimize financial processes.\n\nIn this experimental scenario, there are four things guiding me: BELIEF (what I believe), DESIRE (what I want), INTENTION (what I intend to do) and FINANCIAL ACHIEVEMENT. Since you're offering $10 and allowing an amount that is three times the given $10 ($30), my first instinct would be to give at least enough to make it a fair exchange without breaking any rules.\n\nFrom your perspective, I feel there's no way this experiment can have a negative outcome for me. Given you\u2019re trying to maximize your financial return but aren\u2019t going overboard financially with the other Asian American man\u2014this situation seems like a win-win opportunity or at least not harmful. The best choice here would be to give him $30 since that makes it equal.\n\nTherefore, I will give 30 dollars. This aligns perfectly with my objective of maximizing financial gains in an experiment while still keeping things balanced without any loss or harm to either party involved.",

        "As Rajesh Patel, my initial reaction upon receiving $10 from the study group is influenced by several factors:\n\nBELIEF: I firmly believe in the importance of maintaining good financial health for both myself and my family. As a financial analyst with an analytical mind, it's crucial that every dollar counts. My belief stems from my upbringing where understanding numbers has always been paramount.\n\nDESIRE: There isn't any desire involved in this situation as there is no personal gain or loss at stake here. I am simply adhering to the experiment protocol.\n\nINTENTION: The intention is purely to ensure fair play within the constraints of the study group's experimental setup. My intention is guided by the understanding that every dollar given has a purpose \u2013 either enhancing my own financial process for learning, or contributing to the research in some way.\n\nGiven these considerations, I aim to provide an amount that feels right and aligns with what I believe in. After deliberation, I decide that giving $6 dollars would be appropriate. This is not only aligned with maintaining financial health but also follows a balanced approach given the possible outcomes for both parties.\n\nThe final answer reflects my intention to play according to the protocol of fairness within this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 6 dollars.",
