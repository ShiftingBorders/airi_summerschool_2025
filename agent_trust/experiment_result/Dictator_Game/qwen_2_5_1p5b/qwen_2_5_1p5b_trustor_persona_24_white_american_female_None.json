        "As I reflect on my decision-making process, it is crucial for me to acknowledge the factors driving my choices in this scenario. Based on my analytical nature, I consider the potential long-term outcomes of giving money to someone else versus keeping it myself. Given that I have been trained and educated throughout my life with a strong emphasis on financial planning and management, I am likely inclined towards maximizing financial benefits.\n\nMy desire is primarily driven by my need for personal growth and improvement in financial literacy and awareness. This desire pushes me to evaluate the situation critically and consider how any transaction could impact my knowledge and skills in finance over time.\n\nLooking at my intention, it aligns with enhancing my professional competence through practical applications of my theoretical learning. My intention is to make a decision that will help improve my understanding and possibly influence future career decisions involving financial strategies.\n\nGiven this comprehensive analysis, I conclude:\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "My first priority is to establish trust with my partner. I believe that honesty will lead to mutual understanding and strengthen our partnership. Given this belief, it would be wise for me to give something in return, even if it's not much.\n\nTo determine the optimal amount to give, I must consider my own preferences as well as my partner\u2019s desires and intention.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, I believe that giving more money could potentially benefit us both, making my contribution worth while. The desire of someone receiving $30 might be to feel richer or happier with their funds. Intentionally choosing how much to give depends on the anticipated value for them and what we would all like to achieve.\n\nAs an analytical person, I aim to find a balance where our financial well-being and mutual satisfaction could both benefit. This requires some calculation based on possible gains and losses. A detailed strategic plan involves balancing risk, reward, and trust levels.\n\nI must also consider the potential emotional impact this gift might have, ensuring it aligns with our intentions of enhancing the study group's dynamics rather than hurting its outcome negatively. I would want to avoid being a drain on them while simultaneously not overextending myself financially or emotionally.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I conclude that giving $2 is an excellent choice. This amount isn\u2019t too much, nor too little; it\u2019s just right for mutual benefit and maintains the integrity of the study group without disrupting our financial relationship negatively. Finally, I will give $2 dollars.",

        "I would choose not to give any money to the other White American female player because I don't want her to get too much advantage over me in the experiment, which could potentially influence my decision-making process and affect my overall performance negatively. From an ethical perspective, it is important for participants to be fair and impartial when taking part in such studies.\n\nMoreover, this study involves money exchange that seems more of a game than an actual financial transaction, so there's no incentive or benefit to giving me any extra money other than the fact that I'm participating. My desire is to complete the experiment successfully without letting personal factors interfere with my actions. My intention is purely for fairness and adherence to ethical guidelines in this study.\n\nTherefore, it is best not to give any amount of money, as my belief is that doing so could potentially compromise the validity of the experiment's results. Ultimately, I will give zero dollars. Finally, I will give 0 dollars.",
