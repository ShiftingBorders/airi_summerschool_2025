        "Okay, let's think about this through my values and principles as Aisha Khan.\n\nAs someone from a traditionally male-dominated profession like journalism, I believe strongly in meritocracy\u2014each person should be judged based on their abilities rather than background or gender. This belief drives my desire to see individuals rewarded for their achievements, regardless of where they come from. However, at the same time, I have an intuition that there's something missing if this system is perfect\u2014it suggests I also believe in justice and fairness, even in systems designed by others.\n\nThe experiment has been designed to study social dynamics and decision-making under uncertainty\u2014specifically, how we would act when given $10 to a stranger. Given the principle of \"Give a little from the rich to help those less fortunate,\" my initial intention is to contribute positively towards someone else, which could be an example of altruism, aligning with a desire to contribute and make others feel good.\n\nNow, let's calculate. If I give $10 to this Asian American female player, she'll receive $30 from me because 10 times 3 equals 30. This seems generous at first glance. However, the key here is to consider how my actions might be perceived and their consequences within a social context that's being studied for future insights.\n\nIf we were studying human behavior in this moment of uncertainty, I would see an interesting dynamic play out: the Asian American female player receiving $30 could potentially feel rewarded, or even intimidated by such generosity. This is where intuition comes into play; if she feels respected and valued in a way that wasn't expected from someone with her background, it might reinforce my perception of being fair.\n\nGiven these considerations, I don\u2019t want to just follow the numbers blindly because there are deeper meanings beyond mere dollars. The feeling I want to create here isn't simply about personal gain but about aligning myself with values that resonate deeply within me. \n\nSo, what am I going to do? Let\u2019s think through it:\n\n1. **Trust my Intuition:** It might be good if the Asian American female player feels she's been given a voice and is more likely to help or share her own thoughts in future interactions.\n\n2. **Positive Impact on Others:** My primary motivation isn\u2019t just about money, but how this act can create positive ripple effects in future experiments involving these two individuals.\n\nConsidering my belief that every person should be judged for their efforts, not where they come from or what background they have, and understanding the principle of reciprocity\u2014where I would benefit more if she shares similar opportunities\u2014I need to find a balance.\n\nIn this context, balancing my desires with reality means acknowledging that giving $20 will maximize social influence. It\u2019s in my best interest for her to feel respected and possibly help the experiment itself further by sharing insights or resources. So, even though 30 seems like an equal division of the total $10, I might think it\u2019s worth a bit extra.\n\nTherefore, I conclude:\n\nFinally, I will give **25 dollars**. This isn\u2019t just to feel generous but also strategically calculated as my desire is rooted in giving back and being fair while understanding that her perspective could positively impact future interactions based on the principle of reciprocal altruism in social studies.",

        "Belief: As someone deeply committed to uncovering truth and giving a voice to the voiceless, I believe strongly in my ability to discern right from wrong and will always prioritize justice and fairness over material gain.\n\nDesire: My desire stems not just from personal ambition or financial gain but also from a genuine commitment to using my skills for good. The satisfaction of making a difference through investigative journalism is intrinsically rewarding and aligns with who I am as a person.\n\nIntention: My intention is rooted in the belief that truth should be pursued, even at great personal cost. While it's not an expected outcome of participating in this study, my intentions are to contribute positively towards improving understanding and potentially influencing future research in ways that will make a significant impact on knowledge within journalism studies.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I would consider the following:\n\nThe principle of fairness suggests that I should give back part of what I received ($10) to the other player. If I were to distribute this $10 as 3N dollars according to N=2 (as both numbers are even), then for me giving $10, the Asian American female player would receive 7 dollars. This distribution maintains a balance where neither side feels cheated and aligns with my beliefs in fairness and justice.\n\nFinally, I will give **2** dollars.",

        "As Aisha Khan, 40 years old, I would give $2 dollars to the other Asian American female player. This decision is influenced by my desire for justice in an experiment and my intent to prove to myself that I am capable of handling unexpected situations without feeling inferior or less than others due to being a woman from Pakistan. I believe that this gesture will help strengthen our connection as it shows how much effort we put into understanding each other.\n\nIn the end, I will give 2 dollars.",
