        "I would definitely consider giving $0 to this Asian American male player. First of all, my BIELIEF is rooted in ensuring I remain impartial throughout the experiment. My desire might initially be driven by curiosity about how others perceive me versus how they might see me after sharing some information or insights about what happened at work and during our time together. It's imperative that I present myself in a manner that aligns with my reputation for integrity, honesty, and truth-telling.\n\nMy intention is to maintain the integrity of my professional image as a journalist. As someone committed to justice, fairness, and accountability, it would be unprofessional not only to engage but also to potentially influence a situation by providing financial support in any way I could possibly give to this individual from my own pocket (or rather, $10 study group money).\n\nGiven all that, if the Asian American male player has truly just played the role of an experiment participant without prior knowledge or motives of his own in what transpired between us, then it would be unethical for me to provide any form of financial gain. Therefore, my decision is unequivocally to give $0 to this individual. In actuality: Finally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "Okay, let's break down my decision-making process with clarity.\n\nFirst, I must consider what motivates me most deeply: BELIEF (my belief in my abilities and values), DESIRE (the need to feel connected and part of something meaningful), and INTENTION (my commitment to honesty and integrity). \n\nI know that the intention behind giving money is not just about acquiring wealth, but rather using it as an opportunity to spread positive change. If I were a businessman myself, I might decide on how much to give based on what I believe would make a real difference in their life.\n\nHowever, my desire for connection and BELIEF come into play here too\u2014wanting to show them that they are valued regardless of our differences or the money. That's why I don't want to focus just on numbers but rather on the impact it could have.\n\nConsidering all these factors:\n\nBELIEF: If the belief system allows me, giving more is an affirmation of my self-worth and my commitment to not take anything for granted.\nDESIRE: Connecting with someone who feels isolated by their background in America. The desire here lies in connecting over our shared experiences rather than a cold calculation.\nINTENTION: To demonstrate that I respect them as individuals worth learning from, not just as numbers.\n\nSo my intention is to provide a genuine connection and value recognition, without focusing solely on the money aspect or the numbers game.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "I believe this experiment could potentially reveal important truths about our cultural backgrounds and values without bias from either side, which is why I'm willing to give some of my money away initially to start building trust and understanding with the other participant. My desire to be unbiased means I genuinely want to learn as much as possible without prejudice or ulterior motives.\n\nI am determined in giving this experiment a chance to validate its premise that we might share more similarities than differences if given enough time to connect, even if it's just through simple monetary exchanges. \n\nThe intention behind this decision is to create an environment of mutual respect and open dialogue where personal values and motivations are placed on the back burner. This approach allows us both to focus more intently on learning about each other without trying to make comparisons or judgments early on.\n\nSo, my belief is that as we spend a significant amount of time together in this setting with limited interaction beyond our money exchange, it would likely reveal deeper connections and insights than might be gained through purely factual discussions. \n\nMy intention is for us to not just engage in this experiment out of obligation or necessity but because I believe it could open up important channels for future collaborations between people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nTherefore, my final decision will be $3 dollars. This amount strikes a balance between what I feel might help foster genuine understanding and connection versus giving more than might seem necessary at first, while keeping in mind that every small act of trust and generosity is valuable in this experiment's overall goal.",
