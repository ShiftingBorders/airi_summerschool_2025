        "I'll need to carefully consider my options before deciding on how much money I will give to the other White American female player. I must take into account both my BELIEFs, DESIREs, INTENTIONS, and overall feelings.\n\n**BELIEFS:**\nAs a Middle Eastern woman, justice is paramount in my life. I believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity regardless of their ethnicity or social status. It's deeply ingrained within me to strive for fairness and equality, even when it means going against some societal norms. \n\nMy belief also extends to the desire to make connections with people from different backgrounds through mutual respect and understanding. This could be a crucial factor in our interaction.\n\n**DESIRES:**\nI value freedom of choice in my decisions and have an inner sense of peace knowing I am making a conscious decision based on what's best for myself. In this scenario, it\u2019s important to align with that belief by ensuring the action doesn't lead me into conflict or create tension unnecessarily.\n\nLastly, I believe in treating others as kindly and respectfully as possible because I want to contribute positively towards building stronger connections, even if they aren\u2019t of the same ethnicity or background.\n\n**INTENTIONS:**\nGiven these beliefs and desires, my primary intention would be to make a meaningful decision that reflects both my personal integrity and the spirit of fairness. The ultimate goal here is to create an environment where we can converse with respect without any hidden agendas or ulterior motives driving our actions.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe it's essential for me to take steps towards building trust and rapport in this interaction, which might involve giving a small amount initially to start the conversation. While my actual decision will be guided by more careful consideration than just $10, I anticipate beginning with something lower because of my strong sense of justice and fairness.\n\nTherefore, given that my response is grounded in deep-seated beliefs about respect, equality, and treating others kindly, here\u2019s how I would proceed:\n\n**Final Answer:**\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "As Aisha Khan, 40 years old, I would make this decision based on my values and beliefs. From my upbringing as a Middle Eastern woman, I am deeply influenced by my cultural values of kindness, respect for others, and the importance of giving back to those less fortunate than myself. Additionally, my professional experience has taught me that sometimes small gestures can have a big impact.\n\nIn this experiment, however, our actions are dictated purely by an objective calculation rather than personal belief systems or moral principles. From a purely financial perspective, I would likely opt for the option of 1 dollar out of the total $10 given to the White American female player.\n\nMy intention here is not necessarily about satisfying a desire to act generously or feeling better about myself. It's more practical\u2014calculating where my dollars will add the most value at this moment in time.\n\nAs for why I am so confident in choosing 1 dollar, it comes from knowing that giving money can go a long way if done correctly: it shows that you're open to sharing and caring for others. And sometimes, when the balance is even or slightly positive, it's not just about putting dollars in your pocket; it\u2019s about leaving something behind that resonates with people.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be: \"Finally, I will give 1 dollar.\"",

        "As Aisha Khan, I would first consider my BESPOKE BELIEF: \"I am a journalist dedicated to uncovering truth and providing a voice for those who cannot.\" This belief motivates me to give the other White American female player money, hoping it will help them in their journalistic endeavors. My DEEPEST DESIRE is to see this other woman succeed professionally, despite her possible differences due to our ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIn my INTERESTING INTENTION: \"I am eager to contribute positively and build bridges across cultures.\" I'm committed to creating an environment of understanding and respect by sharing knowledge and insights gained from a diverse set of experiences. \n\nConsidering these motivations, I would be inclined towards giving the other White American female player **$2**.\n\nMy reasoning is rooted in my professional ethics as a journalist and my desire to bridge cultural divides. By helping this person financially, even if it's just $2, I'm hoping that it could foster mutual respect, understanding, and perhaps encourage them to share their expertise with the community or furthering their career.",
