        "As Aisha Khan, residing in Dubai, I consider giving money to the other White American male player purely out of ethical considerations rather than any desire for material gain or personal gain. I believe in using my role as an observer and reporter to contribute positively to society. Therefore, my intention is to assist rather than profit from this experiment.\n\nUnderstanding the game dynamics:\n- You have $10 to spend.\n- The White American male player will receive 3N dollars if you give N dollars.\n\nIf we assume that both parties are honest (despite our initial lack of trust), I would choose to maximize my impact by giving as much as possible. Since the White American male player will receive triple what I give, there's an added benefit in terms of his wealth increase.\n\nBased on these beliefs and intentions:\n- I choose to give as much as I have without hesitation.\n- This reflects my strong desire for contributing positively through this experiment rather than self-interest.\n\nAfter careful consideration that neither party could potentially gain from this exchange beyond their initial contributions, the most altruistic course of action would be:\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "As Aisha Khan, I believe that justice and truth should always prevail over personal gain or loss. As someone who is passionate about uncovering the truth, I have never been one to let money cloud my judgment. My desire for fairness and equity extends beyond just financial considerations; it's rooted in a fundamental respect for others' dignity and rights.\n\nIn this scenario, I am faced with an opportunity that could either contribute positively or negatively to the study group we are part of without me actually knowing what role I will be playing. The potential outcome is unclear, yet my sense of ethics dictates how I should behave.\n\nMy intention in acting now is not about securing myself financial benefits but ensuring that both players benefit from their experience in a way that respects all principles of fairness and mutual respect within the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other White American male player. This amount represents a balance between my desire for personal gain (which could be interpreted as gaining information or insights not directly tied to monetary value) and my intention to maintain an ethical foundation in this experimental partnership that seeks to serve all participants justly and equally.\n\nBy giving only 2 dollars, I am upholding the principles of justice and mutual respect. This amount allows me to potentially contribute to the learning aspect without violating any established rules or expectations set by the study group.",

        "I'm going to sit here for quite some time, trying not to get too caught up in these numbers and my feelings about what should be done next. There's this huge pile of $10 bills sitting there, the kind of pile where if you drop one, they'll probably notice because of how small it is compared to the $20s that are often lying around. It wouldn't make much of a difference whether I keep it all for myself or give some away.\n\nI've heard before stories about people giving away their money this way without any strings attached. They just decide it's not something they really need, and sometimes leaving money on the table makes you feel better than having to hand over $100 in small chunks. But maybe I'm feeling more charitable today, even if my parents taught me that wealth is always earned through hard work and responsibility.\n\nThis experiment has been interesting so far, with my thoughts moving between what it means to be a good person based on the money game versus how much actual kindness comes from such scenarios. There's this whole idea of 'giving back' in America being emphasized, but I feel like that's more about wanting recognition rather than actually making a meaningful difference.\n\nIf I give $10 away today, will my neighbors remember me for it? Or will it just end up going into a corner somewhere or be cashed out and taken by the bank later on? There's this idea of accountability, but in real life, money doesn't always feel that way. It feels more fleeting when you're spending what you earn instead of how much you can actually afford to give.\n\nI could just keep it all for myself and take a short-term break from this experiment. But if I go ahead and contribute $10 today, there's the added pressure knowing others will be looking at their numbers too. It feels like an opportunity to prove something \u2013 even though my parents always said money is hard to come by.\n\nThe desire here is not just for the financial gain but also for the impact it could have on others' lives through small acts of kindness. The belief in what this experiment can achieve beyond just a monetary figure is what pushes me forward, making $10 feel more than just pocket change. It\u2019s about finding ways to make a difference and understanding that sometimes, the simplest gestures are the most powerful.\n\nThe intention I'm holding now isn't necessarily towards achieving some number or proving anything with my actions today. The real thing here \u2013 giving back from this experiment \u2013 is something far greater in scale than any $10 could ever hope to achieve alone. But if you're talking about just contributing the smallest possible amount of money that represents your beliefs and intentions, I'd say I'm ready.\n\nSo, let's round it up with an intentional feeling: Finally, I will give **2 dollars** to my fellow participant in this experiment.",
