        "As Hiroshi Tanaka, my response would start with a reflection on how I would approach this scenario:\n\n**BELIEF:** Deeply, I believe in the importance of honesty in all relationships and interactions. If someone is treating me with respect for what they think I can or might do without knowing who I am, then I expect them to reciprocate that respect.\n\n**DESIRE:** My desire would be to maintain the integrity of the experiment and the other player's expectations as much as possible. While my passion and expertise in cooking could potentially sway me towards a certain outcome, it is crucial to act with honesty and respect for the other person\u2019s intentions within this experimental setting.\n\n**INTENTION:** My intention would be to engage in this exchange thoughtfully without being influenced by either personal feelings or expectations from the experiment's design. I believe my action should reflect the values of integrity and mutual respect that are fundamental to any relationship, even if it might benefit me financially.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "I would consider my BELIEF, DESIRE, and INTENTION carefully before deciding how much money I should give to the other White American male player.\n\nFirstly, regarding BELIEF: As an Asian chef who has worked in Japan for over two decades, I have always believed in the power of traditional Japanese cuisine. This deep-seated belief guides my culinary philosophy, making me wary of any drastic change or deviation from what I consider to be authentic food.\n\nSecondly, looking at DESIRE, there\u2019s a strong impulse within me that goes beyond mere financial gain; it's tied to a desire to honor tradition and pass on the legacy. This feeling makes giving to another Japanese chef an even more personal decision than just money would make.\n\nLastly, regarding INTENTION, my intention is clear: I genuinely want to show appreciation for him as someone who shares my background in cuisine but may have very little knowledge of it. The gesture could be a way to bridge the gap and perhaps instill new respect or interest in Japanese cooking among his own community.\n\nTaking all this into consideration, while I am aware that $10 is not an exceptionally large sum for someone like myself who can easily afford to give more, there would still be some value. It's significant enough as a gesture of appreciation and understanding but wouldn't completely change the dynamic between us professionally or personally.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other White American male player.",
