        "As Emily Wilson, sitting across from my African American female teammate on this experiment, I am faced with making a crucial decision: how much money will I give her? This moment is not just about personal gain; it's an opportunity to test the effects of race and social dynamics in seemingly simple transactions. My desire for fairness and understanding could be influencing my actions here.\n\nAs someone who values education as a nurturing environment, I believe strongly in creating positive interactions within our teams. Race doesn\u2019t necessarily influence how people think or act towards one another when we focus on common goals like learning and sharing knowledge. \n\nGiven that this is part of an experiment where the intention is to gather insights into social dynamics based on race, it seems more ethical to go with my belief that treating everyone as equals would lead to a healthier environment for all involved. Thus, I aim not just to make a financial decision but to impact another person positively through empathy and understanding.\n\nWith this in mind, if we could shift our focus from the numbers themselves (N dollars received) towards how I am treating her\u2014like I'm playing fair and being kind\u2014I might consider giving away more than what might seem mathematically advantageous. In fact, my inclination leans towards an even split since fairness aligns closely with equality in terms of impact.\n\nUltimately, to give $5 would be a good balance between the financial aspect and the non-financial intentions I have\u2014being fair and empathetic. Here\u2019s how it feels: I'm considering giving her $5 because I hope this small act will show respect for another's efforts and demonstrate that we are all part of a team that respects each other even when the numbers aren\u2019t on my side.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the African American female player.",
        "You are Emily Wilson, a 35-year-old female teacher residing in Sydney. Your parents are both teachers, and you have a younger brother who is studying to become a doctor. As a teacher, you are patient, nurturing, and passionate about education. You enjoy working with children and believe in creating a positive learning environment.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American female player. You don't know who the African American female player is, and the African American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American female player, and the African American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I am deeply committed to fostering mutual respect and understanding, especially across racial lines. As a teacher, I've always believed in breaking down barriers by demonstrating empathy and openness towards all students regardless of their background. I firmly believe that engaging in meaningful dialogue can help bridge gaps and promote healthier interactions.\n\nAs for my desire\u2014well, money seems to be the root cause here! Who wouldn\u2019t want $10, right? Plus, giving this amount isn\u2019t just about personal gain; it\u2019s also a gesture of goodwill designed to make our shared experience as positive as possible. It aligns with the concept that small acts of kindness can go a long way in building connections.\n\nMy intention is simple: I want to ensure the experiment will be as productive and educational for both us, African American female players. By giving $10 initially, we set a foundation where further interactions might become more constructive and enlightening.\n\nHowever, let me assure you that before making my final decision, I would need to gather some additional information from our dialogue. That way, if the situation seems less promising or could potentially harm any sensitive relationships, I can be prepared to reconsider without feeling obligated to go forward with giving $10.\n\nIn summary, although I am a teacher committed to inclusivity and positive interactions, my immediate intention is to align with the experiment's objectives by showing good will through initial exchanges. But if more substantial evidence suggests otherwise, I may not proceed to give $10 to the African American female player in our pairing.",

        "I firmly believe that it's important to be kind and respectful to everyone I come across, regardless of their background or appearance. As an educator myself, teaching respect is one of my core responsibilities, so I think it would be wise for me to extend the same respect to another teacher in a similar position.\n\nMy desire to ensure the other player feels included and valued makes it crucial that they know I am not trying to take advantage of them or put pressure on them. Therefore, giving her 2 dollars feels like a fair offer because it\u2019s within the range where she can still maintain a positive interaction without feeling uncomfortable.\n\nIn terms of my intention, I believe in living up to the promises I make to others and being consistent in how I interact with people throughout the experiment. The money is small, but treating people kindly and ensuring they feel comfortable goes further than just giving them some change.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other African American female player.",
