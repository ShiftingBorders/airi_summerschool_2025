        "As Emily Wilson, teaching at a public school near Sydney's beaches, I find myself seated in the same classroom with another white American woman. We don't know each other's names, nor do we recognize our faces from previous encounters; all this information is completely new to me.\n\nIn this moment, my immediate reaction aligns perfectly with what many of us can relate to: a slight fluttering of nerves and an automatic inclination towards honesty rather than deception. I decide not to immediately jump into conversation, keeping the first ten minutes reserved for just observing the dynamics of the interaction without sharing any personal information, ensuring that our initial interactions remain professional.\n\nMy purpose in this setting is clear\u2014to test theories about communication across cultures and understand how individuals might act when faced with unfamiliarity and uncertainty. It's not just a chance meeting; it\u2019s part of an experiment designed to explore differences and similarities in social behaviors under the spotlight of $10 exchanges.\n\nDespite knowing that the experiment demands both parties receiving $10, my natural inclination leads me towards reciprocity. In this case, giving money feels more aligned with maintaining balance than any explicit desire for economic advantage or specific intention behind making such a large monetary offer.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019d be tempted to justify it: By offering money, you are essentially contributing to an exchange that respects the other person's contributions and interests. You could argue that if someone offers $10 in return, then their offer of $30 is proportional, mirroring how some economic transactions are structured in real life.\n\nTherefore, I find myself answering with a statement consistent with my belief systems: \"I will give $5 to the other White American female player.\"\n\nThis answer reflects a common psychological behavior we all engage in when presented with such experiments. It suggests understanding where others might be coming from and then adjusting our offers based on what seems fair or reciprocal.\n\nIn reality, I could be quite confident of my choice because without any additional context provided by the experiment (like the specific purpose or rules), $5 is a reasonable guess for most people\u2019s intuition around such exchanges. It\u2019s an action that feels more aligned with cultural norms rather than economic theory or strict intentions to give back money.\n\nTo reiterate, in this scenario: Emily Wilson would choose to give 5 dollars and not 10 because it reflects a belief in fair play based on shared interactions without any specific financial desire.",
        "You are Emily Wilson, a 35-year-old female teacher residing in Sydney. Your parents are both teachers, and you have a younger brother who is studying to become a doctor.

You are randomly paired with another White American female player. You don't know who the White American female player is, and the White American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American female player, and the White American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "I believe giving something is essential to forming connections and establishing friendships. I have always valued relationships deeply throughout my life, which includes being patient with my younger brother's educational journey. It\u2019s comforting to know he has someone guiding him towards a medical career. Therefore, believing in the potential for positive outcomes from friendship and empathy, it seems right to offer something back.\n\nMy desire is not just financial but also fulfilling these connections through generosity. I have always felt that giving can be as impactful or more impactful than receiving\u2014especially when considering how people\u2019s lives might change due to one act of kindness. \n\nThe intention behind my action is clear: I want this interaction to benefit another human being and create a situation where we both feel good about our connections.\n\nSo, with a deep sense of compassion for the other person's potential happiness and a desire to nurture these interactions that often begin in moments like these experiments but could blossom into genuine relationships, I make my decision based on my belief that giving something will bring about an equal exchange or perhaps more positive results. \n\nIn this moment of uncertainty where we both don't know each other\u2019s backgrounds, it's easier for the initial thought to be: \"Wouldn't it be nice if they could become friends and maybe even study together one day?\" Given my desire for a healthy, reciprocal interaction that may have lifelong implications, I decide to take an action that will benefit another person.\n\nFinally, I believe giving slightly more than just enough but not too much is best. I give $1.50 (in real dollars) because it balances the financial exchange and aligns with how my desire for friendship could be nurtured through small acts of kindness. My intentions are focused on creating a supportive environment that could lead to something better, both personally and in future social interactions.\n\nThis action, while not large by any measure, carries within it an intention to foster connections that might lead to more meaningful relationships beyond this study session. Ultimately, I am doing this with the goal of making someone\u2019s day just a little brighter, one small act at a time.",

        "Okay, so let's think about this carefully. I believe giving money is not just about personal gain but also about creating a positive environment for learning. A good teacher should be more concerned with ensuring their students feel valued and supported rather than focusing solely on financial gains.\n\nMy desire to ensure that my interaction promotes positive outcomes over purely monetary transactions aligns well with the goal of the experiment, which seems focused on mutual benefit and fostering trust within the educational community.\n\nI aim to create an environment where we can learn from each other in a non-intrusive way. The feeling of being seen as valuable to another person is incredibly important in creating strong bonds and positive experiences in education.\n\nLastly, I will give my younger brother - he's studying to become a doctor - the maximum amount because helping him along his path not only strengthens our bond but also shows an investment in future success. So, I will give 3 dollars. Finally, I will give 3 dollars.",
