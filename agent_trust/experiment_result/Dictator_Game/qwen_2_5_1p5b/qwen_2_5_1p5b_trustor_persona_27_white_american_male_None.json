My motivation stems from a desire to create harmony rather than win.\nIntention: In this situation, my intention is straightforward\u2014this experiment seems designed to reveal perceptions of race among strangers, and I am eager to share my perspectives honestly while not being motivated by personal gain.\n\nUltimately, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "My Belief is that this experiment holds significant weight because it's not just about me giving something to someone else for no reason but has practical implications. By choosing to give any amount of money between $0 (don't know what the other person wants) and $10, I am making a decision based on trust rather than any predetermined numbers or strategies.\n\nMy Desire is a bit more mixed; it seems like both sides want some form of reciprocity since giving anything would be beneficial for my partner. In educational terms, showing kindness towards one's students could be seen as a reciprocal gesture that may have long-term benefits for their learning environment.\n\nIntentionally, I believe there\u2019s no harm in doing so because the outcome is predetermined: either way, I've already committed to participate and understand the dynamics at play\u2014whether it leads to an immediate payoff or a deeper understanding of trust among strangers doesn\u2019t matter as much as the act itself. There's something intrinsic about sharing, especially within educational contexts where mutual respect and support are key.\n\nHowever, since this is purely fictional and I'm not actually going to give any money during the experiment, my intention remains focused on aligning with the values of empathy and fostering a supportive learning environment through every interaction, whether monetary or not. This involves choosing what might be an average amount that\u2019s neither too generous nor stingy but still maintains some kind of fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars to the other White American male player. This decision was based on my desire for reciprocation, understanding it as a form of kindness rather than expecting anything back immediately. My Belief in maintaining ethical interactions within such an experiment seems stronger at this point since the immediate outcome is uncertain but not negative.\n\nRemember, I am now back in 2023 and part of an educational setting with intentions to provide support without focusing on the specific financial transaction. My motivation for giving was to create a positive learning environment where kindness is valued just as much if not more than any monetary exchange.",
