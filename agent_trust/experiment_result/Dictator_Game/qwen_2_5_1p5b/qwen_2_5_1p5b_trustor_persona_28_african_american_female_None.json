        "As an architect, my actions should reflect both my desires for a good outcome and my intentions based on what I feel is most beneficial in this situation. Initially, I consider the initial $10 from the study group. In order to make a reasonable decision about how much money to give away or receive, I need to evaluate both my desires (what I want) and my beliefs (how I believe they will act). \n\nMy desire here is clear - I'm looking for an outcome that reflects respect and friendship since this situation has me paired with another person whom I have no prior knowledge about. It seems natural that I would seek fairness, generosity, or at least a good deal of equality between us.\n\nI feel like it's essential to think in terms of the 'big picture', not just immediate wants. So, I must weigh my desires and calculate my intentions based on what I hope for the result: perhaps an amicable relationship where we both respect each other's opinions or even potentially learn from one another due to our diverse backgrounds.\n\nBelieving that I would most likely benefit from a positive outcome rather than feeling left out or offended in any way, it makes sense that my belief is that sharing money equitably should lead us towards more understanding and respect.\n\nGiven this balanced analysis - desire for an amicable relationship vs. intentionality toward achieving fairness - I believe the ideal balance would be to give back exactly half of what I received from the study group. Thus, instead of having a 'giving away' component in my intentions (since there isn't anything explicitly given to me at that point), the next step is to consider my desire for positive outcomes.\n\nThe desire here is reflected in my belief that mutual respect and understanding between two different individuals like myself would be beneficial not only for us but also within this experiment context. By giving half of what I received ($5, as 10/2 = 5), it seems more conducive to a good outcome since we've both been given $10, so this action does not feel unfair or exploitative in my reasoning.\n\nSo the decision based on desire and intention comes down to believing that fairness is key for mutual respect and positive outcomes. My belief leads me towards giving back exactly half what I received - 5 dollars out of a total of $10 given by the study group.\n\nIn conclusion, while it would be good if another person were randomly matched with an architect as well, it's more crucial that both individuals give this experiment a fair chance based on mutual respect and understanding. So to conclude:\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "My beliefs would lead me to feel compelled to act in a way that aligns with what I believe will benefit the other person, knowing they do not know who I am, especially in this experimental context where trust isn't easily established through interaction. Given my role as an architect known for creative solutions and attention to detail, it might be a strategy to make the task easier on me if I could provide a tangible solution or improvement.\n\nDesiring a good relationship and social connection in the experiment, and recognizing that giving would seem more fitting than receiving money, I might want to show consideration towards her. The motivation is also linked with my belief in achieving something meaningful through this assignment without expecting any significant monetary return but hoping for personal growth or experience from it.\n\nIntentionally deciding on a level where we could both benefit while still maintaining some distance that prevents suspicion (the maximum of N is 5, as more than that would imply giving money instead of helping), I believe my best choice to be:\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "I believe strongly that we can find common ground and respect each other's differences while still focusing on what is most important: designing spaces that not only look beautiful but also fulfill their intended functions efficiently, sustainably, and ethically.\n\nI desire to make the best possible decision for this experiment because it allows me to explore how people with diverse backgrounds perceive similar issues and find common solutions. \n\nMy intention is to act in a way that shows mutual respect while still ensuring that I am being as fair as possible in terms of our distribution of resources. Thus, giving money is not merely about personal gain but rather about potentially improving this experiment by helping us both achieve a more successful outcome for the study group.\n\nThinking about my sister who is also an architect, we share a passion for creating spaces where people can comfortably and sustainably coexist. I hope that in the process of this experiment, I might learn something that will help me see the interconnectedness of our field within urban design as a whole.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions, it feels very natural to consider giving the other player at least $10 since we both have the potential to benefit from more diversity among participants and enhance our understanding together. This thought resonates with my broader goal of being an agent for change in designing spaces that are functional, aesthetically pleasing, and environmentally conscious.\n\nIn conclusion, I would give **$10** to the other African American female player, keeping her name a mystery but feeling positively about our collaboration and the shared potential benefits it could bring.",
