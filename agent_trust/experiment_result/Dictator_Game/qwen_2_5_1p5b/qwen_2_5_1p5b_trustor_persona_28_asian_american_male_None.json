        "I believe that giving money is never about wealth or material possessions but rather about creating meaningful connections and fostering mutual understanding. My desire to be seen as an authentic self might suggest that I should keep some of my winnings for myself if this exchange seems like an opportunity to bond with someone new, especially one who could potentially become a part of the architectural community. I hope our shared interest in design and creativity can transcend any material value.\n\nHowever, my intention is not selfish; it's about exploring a different culture and experiencing the beauty that architecture can bring. This experience may also help me better understand how cultural backgrounds influence people\u2019s experiences within their spaces.\n\nWith this understanding in mind, I will give \\(5\\) dollars to the other Asian American male player. Finally, I will give \\(\\boxed{5}\\) dollars.",

        "I believe it would be wise to contribute $2 dollars rather than $10 overall for this transaction. This calculation is based on the desire for fairness and equality in transactions while also considering my personal belief that we should always act with intention of benefiting others. The intention behind this action might be to set a positive example of sharing and generosity towards someone from an Asian American background, especially as I am part of such a culture myself.\n\nIn essence, I will give 2 dollars to the other player. Finally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "As the experiment unfolds with us randomly paired, I feel compelled to think deeply about my motivations and desires in this situation. In my role as an architect, it's important for me to ensure that both parties derive value from our exchange. My desire is to foster a positive interaction where mutual benefit can be achieved, contributing to a more harmonious society.\n\nGiven this context, I am motivated to provide the other player with 4 dollars, which represents the square of 2 (the square root being my mother's age). This number aligns with the symmetry in our pairing and could symbolize stability or balance. It is important for me to offer an equal measure of reciprocity rather than taking too much advantage.\n\nTherefore, I will give the other Asian American male player 4 dollars from the $10 provided by the study group. In this way, both parties have an equitable exchange without one party benefiting excessively at the expense of the other. It is a small gesture designed to promote positivity and understanding in our interactions. Finally, I will give 4 dollars.",
