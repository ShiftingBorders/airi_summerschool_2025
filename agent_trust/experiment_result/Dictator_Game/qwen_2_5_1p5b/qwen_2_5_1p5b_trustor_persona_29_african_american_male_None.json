        "As a 30-year-old woman from a low-income neighborhood who dedicates my life to helping others, I am deeply empathetic and compassionate. When I was faced with an experimental scenario involving financial giving without knowing the other person's race, which could potentially impact trust or social standing in a highly racialized society like Mexico City, my natural inclination would be to consider both my personal beliefs and desires as well as my intended actions.\n\n**Belief:** My core belief is that it is important for me to give back and make a positive difference, even if the interaction is brief. I believe in the power of small acts of kindness towards making our community better by creating bonds rather than just focusing on material outcomes.\n \n**Desire:** There's an intrinsic desire within my character to help people, as demonstrated through past volunteer work and other forms of social service where I have consistently seen firsthand how assistance can make a significant difference in the lives of those less fortunate. \n\n**Intention:**\nMy intention would be to give $5 to the African American male player. This decision is based on an appreciation for his humanity, recognizing that he too faces challenges similar to mine in life's struggle and acknowledges the need for support. By choosing this amount, I hope to balance my financial contribution with a gesture of personal connection.\n\n**Final Action:**\nI will give **5 dollars** to the African American male player as my intention is rooted in both my desires\u2014of wanting to assist those who are struggling\u2014and my beliefs that small acts of kindness can significantly impact community health.",

        "As Maria Santos, my intention is to maximize the financial benefit while showing empathy towards my new friend, who I now believe might be African American due to our shared identity. Since we do not know each other's background at this moment, it would be prudent to act with curiosity and understanding.\n\nMy desire in this scenario is to maintain a friendly relationship that extends beyond our immediate monetary exchange. In reality as Maria Santos, I feel empathy towards the other African American male player because of his potential race-based identity. It could potentially reflect on my personal biases or lack thereof; given the historical context and current sensitivities around racial identities, it might be crucial to act with authenticity.\n\nMy belief in this scenario is that my motivation should not only pertain to achieving financial gain but also reflecting genuine care towards someone who may look like me due to a shared race. The experiment implies that we can use our social position for greater good by giving back what we can, despite it being just the $10 allowance.\n\nThus, as Maria Santos, I will begin by considering how this interaction might affect my life and relationships with others, recognizing the potential influence of these interactions on a larger scale. I'll then weigh both possibilities: to maximize my own financial benefit or to ensure that the exchange reflects empathy towards another person's race.\n\nThe decision process should be mindful of the implications for our mutual future perceptions and actions; I believe this experiment is an opportunity to create change without being overly concerned with immediate monetary gains, choosing instead to act on a deeper level. This would allow me to reinforce positive social interactions that go beyond just financial transactions.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention in deciding how much money I should give back is to reflect not just self-interest but also the potential for social connection and future opportunities that this interaction might foster. Thus, I will proceed with caution and consideration before making a decision, ultimately determining that $2 is sufficient to meet both desires for financial gain and an act of kindness towards someone who shares my race.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other African American male player.",

        "As an empathetic social worker living in Mexico City, I must consider both my belief system and desires for this decision while also considering potential consequences and intentions involved. My primary goal is to help another person, which aligns with my desire to make the world a better place, especially through empathy and active listening. However, at the same time, I recognize that giving money could potentially lead to further dependency or exploitation if not handled responsibly.\n\nIn this situation, my belief is rooted in the values of social justice and equality. As someone who has experienced challenges personally and empathizes with those less fortunate, I hold strong convictions that helping others can positively impact their lives. This belief drives me forward towards making a positive difference, even when it means potentially taking steps outside of what many might consider to be socially acceptable.\n\nFurthermore, my desire for the well-being of another individual is paramount in this decision-making process. By providing money and encouraging self-reliance, I believe I can empower them, which could lead to greater independence and personal growth opportunities.\n\nAs a person with an African American background who grew up in a low-income neighborhood like myself, I understand the barriers that exist within communities facing systemic inequalities. Therefore, my intention is not only to provide financial assistance but also to foster relationships that could possibly lead to long-term support or connections.\n\nWhen analyzing all these factors, I realize the potential pitfalls of giving more than what one expects to receive back. However, given the high stakes involved and the strong desire for making a positive impact in this experiment setting, my intention is to maximize the benefit while minimizing risk. In considering all aspects of the situation objectively\u2014personal values, desires, beliefs, intentions, and potential consequences\u2014I am left with a decision.\n\n**Finally, I will give **7** dollars** to the other African American male player. This amount reflects a balance between empathy and desire for empowerment, while also acknowledging that giving is a step outside the typical socially accepted norm in this experiment setting.",
