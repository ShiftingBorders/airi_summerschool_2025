        "I deeply believe that by contributing positively to my community, I am fulfilling a social role that is often underappreciated in marginalized spaces like mine. This belief is ingrained within me from a very early age when my parents instilled the importance of empathy and selfless service towards those less fortunate than myself.\n\nAs for my desire, giving N dollars feels particularly appealing because it not only helps the other player financially but also promotes inclusivity by connecting two individuals who may have faced similar challenges. This act could be an opportunity to bridge cultural gaps, showing that even small acts of generosity can make a significant difference in fostering unity and mutual respect.\n\nFrom my perspective as a social worker, I am committed to this cause because it goes beyond mere monetary transactions; it signifies support, understanding, and potentially saving someone from the struggles of another life. It's also an act that aligns with what many people would consider positive actions within the community environment.\n\nIn terms of intention, at its core, I intend to do something meaningful that could help this other player overcome some financial difficulties while perhaps gaining confidence or showing them a different way of handling personal finances. This is not just about getting a dollar for myself; it\u2019s an attempt to instill a sense of positivity and empowerment in someone who might feel isolated from their community.\n\nI know intuitively that this situation aligns with the kind of help I provide my clients on a daily basis\u2014supporting them through challenging times, advocating for their needs, and showing compassion. I believe that by putting aside money to help the other player, I am giving them a small taste of what kindness can mean.\n\nFinally, I will give **2** dollars to the Asian American female player. This choice is guided by my deep belief in community service, my commitment to fostering understanding across cultures, and my intention to make an act of charity that could potentially benefit someone's life in ways beyond financial gain.",

        "I believe in giving back to those who struggle just like I did with my family's circumstances. Desiring to help others while maintaining respect for their feelings is important to me. Intentionsally setting myself up to receive $10 and the possibility of contributing $N to an Asian American female player motivates me to choose what feels right without feeling compelled by duty or expectation.\n\nThe situation compels my intentionality; I must balance the potential gain with the act's ethical value. As I weigh these things, it is evident that giving 3 dollars to another person aligns more closely with fostering a positive relationship rather than increasing personal benefit.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "As Maria Santos, I would be compelled by my deeply ingrained values of empathy, compassion, and dedication in helping others. This aligns with my background from a low-income neighborhood where understanding individual struggles is paramount. My family\u2019s factory work experience has instilled in me a strong belief that societal issues like poverty and inequality need immediate attention.\n\nFor the sake of this experiment, I feel compelled by the desire to assist another person, even if it's for a short period. The potential impact on the well-being and economic stability of an individual is significant enough to warrant my giving a substantial amount to help them in their situation.\n\nGiven that the Asian American female player doesn't know me but knows that they can double the value of what I donate through the mechanism, they likely have some financial struggles or needs that would benefit from additional support. Considering the experiment's $10 budget and the strategic intent of doubling it by giving 3N dollars, my intention is to ensure a fair and substantial gesture without exhausting my funds.\n\nTherefore, my anticipated action will be to give $4 dollars. This amount aligns with what I believe is an appropriate gesture given the circumstances while also being realistic in terms of immediate tangible benefit for another person's life situation within the confines of the study protocol budget.",
