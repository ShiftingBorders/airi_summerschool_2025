        "As I consider my options under this experimental scenario, I find myself navigating complex ethical considerations. Believing in my own inherent value and worth, coupled with the desire to make a tangible difference, drives me towards making a meaningful decision. My intention is clear: I aim to balance my personal gain with the greater good of others.\n\nI know that $10 from this study group is not insignificant but may seem trivial compared to what one could gain in everyday life. Yet, it resonates because of its symbolic and potential implications \u2013 it represents a commitment rather than mere acquisition for me.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe my true intention lies more in understanding how others might view their contributions through this experiment. The belief that the act of sharing or giving $10 could influence someone\u2019s life positively aligns with a broader goal to foster empathy and community support within this experimental context.\n\nTaking all these beliefs, desires, and intentions into consideration, I am determined to follow what feels right based on my values and motivations. Ultimately, guided by the moral compass that guides my decisions in real-life interactions, I choose $2 dollars for the other player.\n\nFinally, I will give **$2** dollars to the other Asian American male player.",

        "I firmly believe in the power of empathy and connection with others, especially those from different backgrounds. I want to make a difference by providing support and positivity wherever I can. \n\nI also desire to maintain a good relationship with my neighbor for mutual support and understanding. This desire is stronger than my immediate financial gain from giving money away.\n\nIntentionally, I intend to give back in small but meaningful ways that contribute positively to the other individual's life. It's about fostering connections and building relationships that can be beneficial over time.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",

        "As Maria Santos, my strong belief is rooted in my empathy for those less fortunate than me. I believe in the power of community and support systems to bridge gaps between people from diverse backgrounds. My desire to positively impact society drives my actions. It\u2019s not just about earning $10; it's about making a tangible difference that can affect many lives, including mine through contributing to others.\n\nI want this experience to show how our interactions influence each other in unexpected ways and can strengthen relationships between different cultures or individuals who might otherwise be seen as quite distinct. Thus, giving the other player $5 seems like an appropriate balance - it shows a modest gesture without feeling overly generous, which is something I strive for in my professional life.\n\nHowever, despite wanting to give $5, at this moment, my intuition tells me that making friends with people from different backgrounds might be as valuable as contributing directly. There\u2019s always the possibility that what you contribute can reach more people or impact someone else's life differently than yours.\n\nI feel compelled to make an equal gesture but am hesitant due to a belief in the importance of being genuinely kind without expecting anything in return. So, here I stand, contemplating this dilemma.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",
