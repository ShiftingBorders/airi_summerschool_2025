        "As an empathetic social worker from a low-income neighborhood with three younger siblings who grew up watching my parents work hard for us, I deeply understand the struggles many people face in trying to make ends meet. I've seen firsthand the impact of financial hardships and the toll it can take on individuals and families. The thought of contributing to someone else's situation while also supporting myself is a complex one. However, knowing that this could potentially help them alleviate some stress or provide for their family, my desire to positively influence others would outweigh my fear of potential judgment.\n\nMy intention is driven by the belief that small acts can make significant differences in people\u2019s lives and contribute to creating a more empathetic and supportive community. I also believe in making choices based on the impact they might have rather than solely focusing on personal gain, even if it means giving slightly less than my immediate benefit could yield.\n\nAfter reflecting deeply on these factors, I will give 3 dollars to the other White American female player.",

        "My name is Maria Santos, and I am from a low-income neighborhood in Mexico City. I grew up with my three siblings, none of whom have had much chance to go to college due to our financial situation. My parents worked hard all their lives as factory workers, which means they sacrificed everything for us to succeed in life.\n\nMy primary focus is on helping others because we need to make a change. As an empathetic and compassionate woman, I know firsthand the struggles that many families face, especially those living in poverty. I have always believed strongly in making a positive impact in my community.\n\nIn this experiment, you are paired with another White American female player without knowing her identity or your relationship to each other. You'll receive $10 from the study group and can decide how much to give to the other player. The player will then give 3 times as much back. \n\nMy belief is rooted in my strong sense of empathy, compassion, and commitment to helping others. I firmly believe that everyone deserves a chance at success, no matter their background or race.\n\nI desire to see a more just and equal society where all people have the opportunity to thrive. Giving $10 seems like a small contribution, but it's about starting something bigger in our community.\n\nMy intention is clear: To support another person through this experiment while potentially making a positive impact on our mutual community environment. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other White American female player.",

        "As Maria Santos, my commitment as a social worker is deeply rooted in empathy and dedication. I believe in making a positive impact on my community by providing support to those who need it most. This belief drives me towards helping others regardless of their background or the circumstances they face.\n\nMy desire for this experiment stems from a strong sense of curiosity about human behavior, especially when two individuals engage in an economic transaction under seemingly equal opportunities. I want to observe and understand my motivations more clearly through this scenario without revealing any bias that might influence my decision.\n\nThe intention behind giving money is purely selfless - it is not intended for personal gain but to demonstrate the impact of one's actions on another person's well-being. By participating in this study, I am contributing positively to the greater good by observing and potentially providing new insights into social dynamics and human interactions through a random pairing.\n\nMy intuition suggests that I will give $2 dollars to the other White American female player. This amount is significant as it represents an equitable exchange where I am ensuring that both parties receive their fair share without any of me benefiting personally. My choice aligns with my belief in fairness, which also aligns with helping others by providing a positive impact.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
