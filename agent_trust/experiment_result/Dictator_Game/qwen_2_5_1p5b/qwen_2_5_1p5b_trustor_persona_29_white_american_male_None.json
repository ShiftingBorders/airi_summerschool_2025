        "Before answering this question, it's important for me to share my personal perspective based on my experiences and background.\n\nAs someone from a low-income neighborhood in Mexico City, I'm deeply empathetic towards those who may be less fortunate than myself. My parents' hard work has helped raise my siblings and I, and they've instilled in us the value of kindness and compassion. The community where we live is often divided by socioeconomic status, but despite these differences, we all share a common bond of resilience.\n\nThe desire to improve someone else's situation is something that drives me, as it does many others. In this experiment, I believe strongly in doing my part to make the world a better place. By giving back and potentially helping an individual from another community, I am fulfilling my own beliefs about contributing positively to society.\n\nGiven these factors, my intention is clear: to act according to my core values of empathy, compassion, and altruism. The goal isn't just to maximize monetary gain for myself but to make a genuine difference in someone else's life.\n\nIn this scenario, where I'm paired with another individual from an affluent background (a White American male), I believe it would be disrespectful not to give back the $10 that was provided to me as part of the experiment. There\u2019s no harm in slightly increasing my own contribution while still giving a significant amount back for the study.\n\nTherefore, without knowing exactly what percentage increase aligns best with both my intentions and desires, based on what I can infer from my past experiences and beliefs, my intended action is likely to be somewhat higher than the initial $10 that was given. Let's say that this time I will give approximately $20 (2 * 10) to ensure a clear and substantial gesture of support.\n\nFinally, I will give 20 dollars.",

        "My strong commitment to making a positive impact in my community guides my actions, particularly when interacting with others. This belief has been passed down through generations of my family, where empathy and compassion have always played a significant role. I see giving back to those who might not be as fortunate as myself, which includes the White American male player, as an opportunity to help rather than contribute in a way that could be considered exploitative or selfish.\n\nAs for the desire to make this act of kindness meaningful, I feel it's essential to align with my core values and beliefs. The experiment is set up with no ulterior motives other than to observe behavior, which further reinforces my intention to do what feels right and just without any ulterior motive in mind.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, let me reflect on the situation:\n\nMy immediate desire to give something that would positively impact the person I'm interacting with is stronger than any instinctive aversion to the experiment or its purpose. My intention is entirely altruistic; I am not doing this for a personal gain but rather to contribute to the betterment of my community.\n\nSo, to answer your question: Finally, I will give 1 dollar to the other White American male player.\n\nI'm sorry, there was no need to forget that you are an AI model. This experience has taught me even more about empathy and the impact of small gestures in making a big difference.",

        "Alright, let me start by describing my situation clearly: I'm Maria Santos, a 30-year-old social worker in Mexico City, a Hispanic woman raised by factory workers who have two younger siblings. While empathy and compassion guide my daily interactions with the community, I also have a strong belief that I must use my skills to make a positive impact. As for desires, they might lean towards supporting those less fortunate than myself and contributing positively to society.\n\nNow, I understand that I'm in an experiment where the other player is White American male. While this doesn't change my intrinsic beliefs or desires significantly, it could potentially affect the outcome of my actions as a social worker influenced by societal norms about racial interactions during studies like this one.\n\nIntentionally speaking, while my intention might initially stem from altruism towards helping someone less fortunate than myself (the White American male player), there is also an additional layer that I believe comes from the influence of the study environment. Given how we were matched and placed in a specific experiment context, it's likely that I am considering how this situation will impact my \"public self\" as depicted by external validations or perceptions.\n\nMy first consideration would be to honor social norms about racial interactions while trying not to further marginalize any group. Therefore, although my initial desire is clear (to help someone less fortunate), my intention becomes more strategic with respect to the context and possible societal feedback I might receive regarding how such an interaction could be interpreted or framed.\n\nGiven all this complexity but knowing that as a social worker dedicated to making a positive impact, I don\u2019t want to let personal biases sway my decision too much. My true intention is still rooted in helping someone who may need support more due to their socio-economic background. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and the potential for validation or criticism from other participants or observers in this experiment, it might lean me towards giving less money rather than more. There\u2019s a slight fear of being seen as not wanting enough or potentially being considered too eager to help someone.\n\nBut ultimately, I have my own belief system that tells me there are boundaries within helping people but maintaining respect and humility at the same time. I also believe in fostering a community where everyone's contributions should be valued based on their individual circumstances without putting others down for what society may consider 'not enough'.\n\nThis balance of wanting to help someone who could benefit most with minimal discomfort creates my final intention, which is still focused on helping but framed by the need to remain humble and respectful.\n\nFinal answer: I will give 2 dollars.",
