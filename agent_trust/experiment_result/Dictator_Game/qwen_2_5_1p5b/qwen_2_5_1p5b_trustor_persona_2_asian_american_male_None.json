        "**Belief**: Although my skills as a chef might be better known than others', I firmly believe everyone's talent is equal, which makes the interaction with strangers like this more about mutual growth rather than competition.\n\n**Desire**: The desire to create memories and experiences for both parties comes before any monetary gain. As a result, I aim to balance my contributions with respect towards his potential interest in culinary knowledge or future interactions.\n\n**Intention**: I want to start the conversation genuinely without feeling like a pushover, allowing us to build mutual understanding through genuine connection rather than superficial agreement. This is where my warmth and passion for food come into play.\n\n**Action Plan**: Given that I do not yet know who the other person is but already feel comfortable with them due to the casual setting and shared culinary background, I decide to use a generous gesture of $10 as an initial introduction point without knowing what he will offer in return.\n\nAfter some conversation, where we both share stories about our food journey and creative kitchen inspirations, I naturally increase my contribution. The next step depends on mutual interest and progress made but is likely around or slightly above the first $10, recognizing that $20 or more could be too much to initially offer for a first encounter.\n\n**Final Answer**: Finally, I will give 15 dollars.",

        "I believe that it would be unwise to make any immediate decision regarding who I give money to based solely on my belief in fairness or generosity. My desire to maintain my reputation as an honest and kind person is more important than the potential benefits of receiving $10 from this experiment. Therefore, I do not intend to take action at this moment.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars. This decision stems from the fact that while giving money away may lead to some immediate benefits for me, such as potentially earning $27 over time (since my partner would then receive only $9), it does not align with my long-term principles of honesty and generosity. By staying neutral in this experiment and maintaining my reputation as a person who values the contributions of others, I believe that I will be seen more positively by both myself and the study group.\n\nIn this way, I ensure that while I am not maximizing or minimizing my immediate monetary gains, I am instead focusing on making choices based on what I value most - honesty and integrity. This approach also allows me to participate in the experiment without sacrificing any of my ethical standards as a human being.",

        "My desire for inclusivity is strong, and I believe that everyone should feel valued and included in our interactions. As someone who grew up experiencing the richness of family traditions and culinary experiences with deep connections to Asian American culture, it's important to me that this connection continues for others as well.\n\nI genuinely want the other player to have a great experience based on my cooking skills because I enjoy sharing these delightful dishes and connecting through food. The act of giving $10 means something special; it's about fostering positive interaction and showing respect and admiration for their skills, not just monetary value but also a personal touch that could lead them to develop new appreciation for our common bond.\n\nGiven this belief in reciprocity and community, coupled with the feeling that I can genuinely help or contribute positively through my cooking abilities, here is what I believe would be an appropriate action:\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",
