        "As Javier Rodriguez, I believe that it is important to create positive experiences for both parties involved in this experiment. As a man who has always been passionate about sharing his culinary talents with others, I understand the impact my actions could have on those around me. My desire is to contribute positively and make sure the other player feels appreciated. The intention is to ensure fairness by contributing $10, which would be the midpoint based on N dollars given from 2N dollars received.\n\nHowever, it's also crucial that I remain genuine in my decision-making process rather than trying to influence outcomes based on stereotypes or assumptions about our backgrounds. My ultimate intention is to align with what feels most sincere and respectful. With this reflection, I believe giving the other player $5 would be appropriate. This amount respects both the money I am donating (the midpoint) and acknowledges the shared experience without feeling overly generous or insincere.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American male player, and the White American male player will receive 3N dollars.

        "I would definitely give some money to my new partner tonight because I don't want them to feel taken advantage of or left out due to our age difference. However, I also need to consider what could happen if we end up in the same position again in future experiments where this dynamic might play out differently.\n\nMy desire is for a good dining experience and to ensure they have enough money from my generosity. My belief is that I am not being asked to do something unethical or unfair, but rather playing along with an experimental study. Therefore, it's important to balance giving them what they deserve with ensuring they don't feel undervalued.\n\nIntentionally speaking as myself, I would carefully calculate the appropriate amount for the other player and possibly consider splitting it in a 1:2 ratio of $5 each just to be generous but not overcompensate. This approach respects their worth while also showing consideration without making them feel special.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars.",

        "My initial impulse might be to think, \"How can I maximize my own gain while ensuring that both of us leave feeling like we've both received benefits?\" From a personal perspective, I value not only material gains but also the experience and enjoyment derived from sharing dishes with others. This is where my desire and intention come into play.\n\nFor my BELIEF aspect, I believe strongly in the principles of fairness and mutual respect. If I were to give more than what I think would be a fair amount, it could potentially create an imbalance that I don't want to risk by giving away my trust or integrity.\n\nWhen it comes to DESIRE, I genuinely enjoy cooking with others and creating delicious meals for loved ones. The last thing I'd want is to disappoint someone who has invited me into their home because they were unsure of what to expect.\n\nIn terms of INTENTION, my intention here is not just about monetary gain but also about building a positive relationship through shared experiences. By giving more than the other player would likely receive (3N), I aim to strengthen our connection and potentially influence them positively in ways that go beyond simple economic transactions.\n\nHowever, after carefully considering these factors, I feel it's important for me to give back, not because I want to get an equal amount, but because I truly value the time we're spending together creating something delicious and enjoyable. In any transaction, there is a balance, and it would be irresponsible of me to prioritize my personal gain over that of others.\n\nFinally, I will give **1 dollar** to the other White American male player. This decision takes into account all aspects \u2013 the principle of fairness, the desire for connection, and the intention to create positive memories that go beyond this monetary exchange.",
