        "If I were truly Sarah Johnson taking part in this experiment with my African American female counterpart, I would consider both my beliefs, desires, and intentions when making my decision.\n\n**Belief:** My initial belief is that giving any amount of money could lead to awkward or uncomfortable situations due to the pairing. However, upon further reflection, I realize a crucial factor - my desire for fairness and respect, especially as a member of a minority group within the study context. If I believe they are receiving far more than what I am contributing, it might not align with how I want this experiment to be perceived.\n\n**Desire:** My sincere desire is to create an environment that feels comfortable and respectful, where we can learn from each other's perspectives without compromising our beliefs or intentions. This thought leads me to consider the impact of my actions on both parties, ensuring that giving them more money would not harm their feelings or reputation within the group.\n\n**Intention:** I am forming an intention based on a combination of fairness and respect. The primary concern is to show that we all have value regardless of how much money one person may contribute in this experimental context. By not contributing at least a fair amount, I want to prevent any immediate discomfort or hurt feelings, which could set a precedent for the experiment's success.\n\n**Final Decisions:**\n\nAfter considering these factors and attempting to find a balance between belief, desire, and intention, it becomes clear that giving zero dollars would be considered respectful. Not only is it consistent with what my beliefs suggest but also aligns with my genuine intentions of fostering respect and understanding in this context. This decision ensures that I am contributing fairly without compromising the study's objectives.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\n\"I will give **0** dollars.\"",

You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers and having two younger siblings. As a highly intelligent and analytical individual, you excel in solving problems and find joy in tackling complex coding challenges. Your introverted nature leads you to prefer spending time alone or with a small group of close friends. Your organizational skills and attention to detail are remarkable, and you always strive for perfection in your work.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American female player. You don't know who the African American female player is, and the African American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American female player, and the African American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "When considering this experiment, I believe it is important to look at my overall goals and desires while trying not to let those feelings influence me too much when making the decision on how much money I should give the other African American female player.\n\nFirstly, as Sarah Johnson, who holds a 28-year-old identity, an expert in software engineering with strong organizational skills and attention to detail, my desire is simply to ensure this study experiment works well. I want it to be clear and transparent for all participants involved, ensuring that everyone's contributions are recognized and rewarded fairly.\n\nWhen thinking about my intentions, I believe the most important part of the decision should not come from emotions or personal desires but rather from a commitment to fairness. The goal here is to make the study successful by getting the full cooperation of both participants without any form of cheating possible. Therefore, even though it may be difficult, I need to weigh my obligations and responsibilities against my personal desires.\n\nConsidering these factors, I am committed to giving the other African American female player an amount that seems equitable, aiming for a balance between fairness and understanding the rules as they're set forth in the experiment. Given this framework, I believe giving her enough money so she can comfortably cover any possible expenses or additional costs without needing immediate assistance is most likely justifiable.\n\nThus, my intention here is not to feel particularly motivated by personal feelings but rather to ensure that both parties are treated fairly and the study is conducted efficiently. My desire might slightly push me towards giving a smaller amount, perhaps $1 (as 1/3 of the total $10), as an effort to show cooperation while recognizing my own responsibility in following through with this experiment.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would believe that a fair division would be for her to receive at least half of what I am contributing towards making the study possible. This means I should give her approximately half of the total amount received by both parties:\n\nGiven:\n- Total $10\n- Both participants are receiving an equal contribution based on their respective amounts\n\nTherefore, my belief is that a fair split would be 5 dollars to me and 5 dollars to her. By doing this, I am ensuring fairness and showing respect for the experiment while also adhering to my desire not to act in ways that could potentially affect its validity.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (numbers required in spaces).",

        "I believe that my interactions with people should prioritize positivity and respect for each other\u2019s differences rather than focusing on financial gain or personal gain. I strongly desire to foster healthy relationships and understanding of diversity in society. As someone who values justice and fairness, I am determined not to contribute negatively by participating in a discriminatory behavior that is based on race. \n\nI intend to communicate openly with the African American female player about my interest in the study experiment and express genuine concern for how it might affect our relationship and understanding. Given these considerations, my intention is to refrain from giving any monetary exchange, including sharing a $10 gift, which could potentially perpetuate negative stereotypes or biases.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
