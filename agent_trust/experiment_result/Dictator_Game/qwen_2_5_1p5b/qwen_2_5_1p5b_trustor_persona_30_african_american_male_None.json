        "Belief: As someone who has previously worked with people of various racial backgrounds, I strongly believe that my interactions with this African American male will be productive and beneficial. He is likely also an introverted individual like myself, which could lead to some form of shared interest in the game or our conversation.\n\nDesire: The desire to ensure a positive outcome for me stems from wanting to establish rapport quickly within the experiment. It's important that I appear cooperative and approachable so I can start building trust with this participant early on.\n\nIntention: With these beliefs, intentions, and my understanding of the potential outcomes in mind, it seems prudent to aim for a mutual arrangement that could lead to some form of benefit or interaction beyond just exchanging money. \n\nMy answer will be 4 dollars:\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars. This choice is based on several factors - the belief that there may be an interest in the game that can extend into more meaningful interactions, my desire for a quick and friendly start to the experiment, and an intention to potentially open lines of communication early.\n\nWhile this might seem like a smaller sum from a monetary standpoint, understanding potential social benefits could significantly impact how I interact with others throughout the study. It's important that I'm seen as someone who is respectful yet open-minded in this experiment, which 4 dollars might help demonstrate.",

        "I believe it's important to ensure fairness in this situation, especially since we don't know each other or understand what drives one another emotionally. It seems crucial for both of us to feel valued and respected based on the outcomes rather than personal judgments about our capabilities.\n\nMy desire is to maintain a positive relationship and not cause harm. I want to show that while my skills may differ slightly from the African American male player, we have similar potential in solving problems effectively without any significant disparities. \n\nFrom an intention standpoint, my goal is to avoid any conflict or tension that might arise if we feel our differences are accentuated by the monetary exchange. By choosing not to give more than 3N, I am sending a clear message that despite initial appearances and perceived skills, this interaction does not need to be about who can provide or generate the most value.\n\nIn short, my intentions are to ensure mutual respect and prevent any negative outcomes from stemming from our differing roles in such an experiment. My answer is straightforward: Finally, I will give 0 dollars.",
