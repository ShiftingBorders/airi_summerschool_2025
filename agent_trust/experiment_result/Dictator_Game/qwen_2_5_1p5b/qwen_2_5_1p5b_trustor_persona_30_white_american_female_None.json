        "My goal here is not just to maximize my return on investment but also to consider the relationship I am forming with the other player in this experiment. \n\n**BELIEF:** Initially, I believe that simply maximizing my own financial gain will lead to an agreement and thus improve my situation within the study group. The desire for more money aligns with the intention of improving one's economic circumstances by increasing their net worth.\n\n**DESIRE:** While I would love $10, the ultimate goal is to ensure a positive outcome that benefits both parties in the experiment as well. By potentially making a larger financial gesture and agreeing on a reasonable amount, it could open up opportunities for future experiments or relationships where such generosity can be reciprocated.\n\n**INTENTION:** The intention here is not just about money but also maintaining respect within the study group and adhering to what feels right rather than following strict financial calculations. \n\nUltimately, I will give **$5** dollars (numbers in spaces). This amount aligns with my desire for both a reasonable gain and the potential for future positive outcomes from this interaction. It maintains a balance where I show that I am considerate enough to avoid overwhelming or alienating the other player, while still contributing positively to the experiment's goals by maintaining the study group's respect.",

However, it\u2019s important for the integrity of the study to follow their protocol exactly.\n\nSo I'll choose a neutral option that respects both my desire for fairness and the expectation from the researchers. What do you think I should give?",

        "I believe it would be wrong of me to contribute more than what my friend has already given me, especially since we've both worked hard on this task together so far. I also strongly desire for our friendship to remain strong, despite the experiment setting us apart in terms of circumstances. \n\nBut I cannot ignore that my intention is pure: the $10 stipend from the study group and wanting to ensure a balanced outcome based on what others receive while being fairly rewarded myself. Therefore, my action will be driven by those beliefs and desires with an intention of remaining true to them.\n\nFinally, I will give **5 dollars** to the other White American female player.",
