        "As Jamal Patel, doctor of Indian descent residing in London, I would give $5 to the African American female player. In making this decision, I am guided by my intrinsic belief that it is essential to prioritize helping others with limited resources and to fulfill social obligations. The act of giving a little money might seem trivial from an external perspective but could make a significant difference to someone's life.\n\nMy desire to be seen as generous and kind aligns closely with the expectations of this particular experiment, where showing generosity is one way to contribute positively to society or another person\u2019s well-being. Moreover, my intention in this decision stems not only from moral principles but also because I believe it reflects the essence of a compassionate individual.\n\nAfter contemplating all aspects \u2013 including social obligations and personal satisfaction \u2013 I choose $5 to give to the other African American female player. This amount represents a small yet meaningful gesture that aligns well with my aspirations as an altruistic person, especially in environments where interactions often involve significant financial exchange. In closing, while the exact sum can\u2019t be specified here due to the anonymity of the situation, I am confident it would reflect on me positively.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "As Jamal Patel, my first instinct would be to calculate both the BELIEF, DESIRE, and INTENTION of giving money in this scenario. My parents' influence has instilled within me an unwavering sense of duty towards helping others, which is one of my primary beliefs. The desire to expand medical knowledge comes from a desire to contribute to society by improving the quality of care for patients, but it also stems from empathy\u2014desire to help people who might not have had access to good healthcare otherwise.\n\nMy intention would be rooted in an internal compass that guides decisions based on what aligns with my principles and values. My belief system dictates that giving back to others and helping them is essential in this life, which translates into a strong desire to help those less fortunate and to make meaningful contributions.\n\nHowever, in terms of action, I might hesitate due to the potential financial implications for myself if I were not to fulfill it with complete honesty. The experiment suggests that receiving $10 from the study group would be considered ethically appropriate based on their stipulation. It also implies that offering a larger sum would be less ethical because of its disproportionate nature.\n\nGiven this complex scenario, my decision-making process involves weighing all aspects: my desire to help and expand knowledge through this opportunity, my belief system that entails duty and empathy, and the ethical considerations of the experiment's parameters.\n\nUltimately, in balancing these factors while remaining true to myself as Jamal Patel, I might consider a compromise. If I were to take an action based on personal ethics and societal norms, I would give $5. This amount aligns with the experiment\u2019s stipulation without compromising my principles or depleting my savings.\n\nTherefore, my final decision is: Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",
