        "My beliefs lead me to prioritize fairness in this situation. As someone committed to making positive changes and understanding differences, I aim to avoid any actions that might contribute to inequality or misunderstanding. This aligns with my desire to maintain good relationships and ensure everyone feels respected.\n\nIn terms of intention, my primary motivation is not about the money itself but rather creating a harmonious environment for our interaction. The $10 provided by the study group serves as an experimental stimulus, allowing us to explore dynamics in different settings. I see this experiment as an opportunity to learn from diverse perspectives and understand how people respond under these circumstances.\n\nTo answer your question: Finally, I will give 4 dollars to the other African American male player. By giving him 4 dollars, we ensure that we both have a sense of satisfaction from our actions, promoting fairness and mutual respect. This approach acknowledges the contribution made by both parties and aligns with my desire for positive interactions within this experiment.",

        "I believe that by helping my friend, I am fulfilling my duty as a doctor. It is essential for me to show empathy and compassion in all of my interactions with others, including those who don't know me yet. As someone who has always believed in giving back, this opportunity presents an excellent chance for me to positively contribute.\n\nThe desire to make the other African American male player happy motivates me further. I understand that this experiment is a way to increase understanding and bridge divides, especially between individuals from different backgrounds like our own. By showing generosity, we may be able to create lasting bonds in this small community setting.\n\nMy intention here is also centered around the future of this experiment. It could lead to significant insights about interactions across racial lines and provide useful data for those studying inter-group dynamics or addressing biases. This can potentially make a positive impact beyond just my personal understanding, enhancing knowledge on social behaviors within multicultural environments.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar to the other African American male player.",
