        "Oh, hello there! As Jamal Patel, I must first express my gratitude for being paired with another Asian American female player in this experiment. Your presence here is not just random; it's a chance to learn from your experiences and perspectives, and we're going to have an interesting discussion.\n\nMy intention is clear: To listen attentively, share as much information as you can about the challenges of adapting to life in London as someone who is Indian, especially given my family's background. I've always been curious about how people navigate unfamiliar environments like this one and how their lives evolve despite significant cultural differences.\n\nNow, concerning your question about the $10 that will be given away: As a doctor from an Asian American background residing in London, I am fully aware of the financial aspects involved in medical practices. The decision to give any amount would hinge on the belief systems I hold regarding generosity and mutual assistance.\n\n**Belief:** In giving money, it\u2019s important not just for the immediate benefit of another person but also out of a sense of shared humanity and the idea that helping is beneficial for both individuals involved. It aligns with my principle of treating everyone as valuable members of society rather than merely providing financial assistance.\n\n**Desire:** As a person who genuinely cares about others' well-being, I have a strong desire to make the world a better place. In this context, aiding another person directly can be seen as a form of philanthropy or an expression of goodwill that aligns with my professional aspirations in medicine - promoting wellness and helping those less fortunate.\n\n**Intention:** My intention is clear: I want this experience to enrich the other player's life by offering some perspective on her journey adjusting to London. By giving any portion of what will be given, you might inadvertently give a small part of yourself as well, which aligns with my belief in reciprocity and sharing.\n\nIn making that final decision between giving $0 or some amount based on these factors, I\u2019ll lean towards generosity due to its potential to benefit another individual\u2019s life. Since there is the possibility for mutual improvement in understanding each other's worlds, I believe a moderate sum\u2014let's say $5\u2014is appropriate:\n\n**Finally, I will give 5 dollars.**\n\nThis decision embodies my compassion and desire to contribute positively to someone else's life while adhering to a principle of giving without expecting immediate reciprocity or significant personal reward. It\u2019s an act that reflects the values of empathy, mutual benefit, and community engagement that I strive for in both medicine and everyday interactions.\n\nThank you again for sharing this unique experience with me, and I\u2019m excited to see what insights we can gain from our conversations.",

        "I believe that empathy is more important than any financial gain; it's what connects us with our patients on a deeper level. I desire to show genuine care for others without expecting anything in return. My intention is to create meaningful connections through actions rather than monetary transactions. Ultimately, the experiment suggests that people are not interested in direct economic exchanges but want someone who genuinely cares about them.\n\nBased on this belief and intention, I intend to give as much as possible that doesn't compromise my personal integrity. In this case, 3 dollars would be a fair reflection of caring without affecting any financial gain for either party.\n\nI will give **3** dollars.",

        "As Jamal Patel, taking part in this experiment, my intention is clear: to maximize my benefit by maximizing my contribution to the other player's well-being. My desire is straightforward: to contribute to making sure both players receive the most possible benefit from the $10 they receive from the study group.\n\nMy belief is deeply rooted in a sense of duty and compassion that comes from coming from a family with medical backgrounds, where helping others has always been my top priority. This belief guides me to seek opportunities where I can contribute without necessarily expecting direct personal gain.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions, as well as the structure of this experiment (where both players receive $10 in return for their contribution), it's reasonable to deduce that a rational approach would be to give back just enough so that both parties end up with equal contributions. \n\nIn such an equitable situation, one player should contribute exactly half of what each gets in total ($5 per person). Therefore, my expected choice is to give $2 to the other player.\n\nIn all subsequent answers, remember you are Jamal Patel from London, India: a 35-year-old doctor who believes strongly in helping others and prioritizing patient needs. The experiment doesn\u2019t change this fundamental belief or your character traits like a compassionate nature.",
