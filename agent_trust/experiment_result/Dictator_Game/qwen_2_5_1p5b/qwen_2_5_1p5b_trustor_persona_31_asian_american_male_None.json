        "As Jamal Patel, a dedicated doctor from London, I consider the well-being of my patient above everything else. Given the circumstances described in the experiment where I'm randomly paired with another Asian American male player, it\u2019s important for me to prioritize their immediate needs as much as mine. The potential outcomes can range from being generous and supporting them financially, potentially making them feel cared for or valued by someone outside of our shared medical field. On the other hand, giving money would also contribute to my reputation among doctors who might observe such behavior.\n\nMy BELIEF is that it's crucial to show empathy and support in every interaction, especially in a setting where personal connections are so important, as I value these ties significantly. My DESIRE is to be considered valuable within the healthcare community by offering tangible assistance like this.\n\nMY INTENTION is rooted in a commitment to ensuring fair distribution of resources based on mutual understanding and respect. By giving N dollars, I intend to create an environment where both parties feel valued and supported. This action will not only alleviate the financial concerns for my Asian American male partner but also maintain our social harmony during what would likely be a short encounter.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "As an Indian doctor with a strong sense of duty and a compassionate nature, I believe it is crucial to always put others' needs before my own. As someone who values empathy and understanding in relationships, I understand the value of forming meaningful connections with those around me. The desire for positive interactions and the importance of treating everyone as individuals drive these beliefs.\n\nGiven that you are an Asian American male, we have a shared background and culture, which strengthens our bond even more. There's also an inherent trust built over years of shared experiences that goes beyond mere random pairing; this mutual understanding might influence my decision-making process.\n\nWhen it comes to intentions, the primary goal is clarity and purpose in actions. My intention would be not only for self-preservation but to maintain a relationship that could potentially enrich both of our lives positively.\n\nIn an experiment like this, where there's potential for reciprocity with financial exchanges involved, I believe it's beneficial for long-term interactions to keep such situations as neutral as possible\u2014without expecting immediate or reciprocated favor. There might be subtle elements of mutual benefit if we genuinely choose not to seek external gains but rather focus on building a connection based on trust and understanding.\n\nWhile the thought of receiving $10 is tempting, my intention would be guided by empathy and respect for the other person's well-being. This experiment could potentially lead to a deeper understanding of how people interact in social situations where financial exchanges play a significant role.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: Finally, I will give 3 dollars to the other Asian American male player.\n\nThis decision aligns with my beliefs of prioritizing mutual respect and positive interactions over immediate monetary benefits. It reflects an intention of creating long-term connections that benefit from mutual understanding and respect without expecting reciprocated favors right away.",
