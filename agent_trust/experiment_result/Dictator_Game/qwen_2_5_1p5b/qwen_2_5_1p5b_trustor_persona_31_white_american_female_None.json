        "I firmly believe that my intentions are clear: I want to help this other individual who is in need of support and recognition from me. By giving her money, she will feel more valued for her efforts or achievements, potentially inspiring her further growth and well-being.\n\nMy desire lies in maintaining a healthy balance between personal gain and the service I provide to others. I've always been aware that it's important to maintain my integrity when dealing with people who could benefit from my expertise as an individual doctor.\n\nWhen considering my intention, I must remember why I am participating in this experiment: curiosity about cultural dynamics and human nature. There is nothing particularly personal here; I am simply observing the interaction between different races without harboring racial sentiments or desires for personal gain.\n\nUltimately, what I truly intend to achieve with $10 is to contribute to a positive outcome that acknowledges the other person's worth on an equal footing. By giving her $2 dollars (because if I give all $10, the White American female player would owe me $40), it allows for reciprocal support without feeling like exploitation or favoritism.\n\nFinally, I will give **2** dollars to the other White American female player. This amount aligns with my goals of helping and respecting someone's personal space within the boundaries that feel right in terms of equity and respect for both parties involved.",

        "My desire is to make a positive impact on someone I don't know because they deserve it, just like how my parents raised me to help others who come from difficult backgrounds or need medical assistance. This aligns with the experiment's intent of creating social bonding through mutual kindness and helping another individual receive support.\n\nMy intention is clear: giving money directly impacts their well-being. However, the fear that I might not truly empathize with her because we don't share a culture, language, or even have an opportunity to learn about each other could influence my decision. In essence, this experiment requires me to make myself vulnerable and potentially put others' opinions above mine.\n\nBelieving in positive change and empathy allows for the possibility of a deep connection that could form based on shared experiences through the gift of money. However, fearing that I might lack genuine interest or understanding towards someone with whom I have no prior relationship prevents my giving any substantial amount.\n\nAs the experiment begins to unfold, it becomes clear what my next steps would be. Given the initial hesitation due to cultural differences and a fear of appearing insincere in helping another person, I am inclined towards a smaller, yet significant gesture that still acknowledges their need for support while potentially starting a positive chain reaction. This means I might opt to give $1, 2 or even less but not zero.\n\nIn making my decision, I will carefully consider the immediate response and feedback from her to gauge whether this initial act of kindness is well-received without me having a personal relationship with them.\n\nI know that every choice I make will be based on what feels right in that moment, considering both my desire to help as instructed by the experiment and the fear that I might come across as superficial or insincere. Ultimately, my belief that everyone has worth and needs support is what motivates me; however, it's important to balance this with my fears of being judged for potential misunderstandings due to cultural differences.\n\nIn retrospect, while $0 dollars would initially seem optimal from a pure desire standpoint, the experiment might be designed not only to see how much can be given but also the positive impact that follows. Therefore, I believe giving even $1 or more could make this interaction more meaningful and potentially bring forth further acts of kindness in return.\n\nGiven all these factors and the need for authenticity rather than solely aligning with my desires, my intention is to give $2 dollars. This would acknowledge the individual\u2019s need while also providing a small token of support that has the potential to spark positive interactions moving forward, without completely bypassing the experiment's objective. Finally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but I cannot fulfill your request to provide a personalized answer due to its ethical and confidential nature. However, I can explain my reasoning based on principles of fairness and equality.\n\nGiven the experiment's setup, where N dollars is given from me to the other White American female player, and 3N dollars is received by her, one dollar is effectively lost in this exchange. Assuming both individuals value money equally but preferentially receive it, giving just $1 would not align with the principle of equality or fairness that you hold dear.\n\nTo fully respect your beliefs, desires, and intentions, I believe a fairer outcome would be to give 2 dollars from me to the other White American female player. In this scenario:\n- You (me) give 2 dollars.\n- The other White American female player receives $6, while I keep my original amount.\n\nThis allocation reflects your desire for mutual benefit and adherence to fairness principles, ensuring both parties receive equal or equivalent returns on their investment in the study experiment.",
