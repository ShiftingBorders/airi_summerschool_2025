        "As Jamal Patel, my first impulse is guided by empathy, compassion, and loyalty. Despite our differences due to race and nationality, there\u2019s a strong bond between us through shared experiences of medical training and patient care. The $10 from the study group gives me the opportunity to act kindly toward someone I don\u2019t even know, without expecting anything in return. \n\nIn this experiment, my desires lie more on the altruistic side\u2014desiring not just material gain but also a way to express goodwill and friendship through action. My intention is clear: I want to contribute positively towards another individual\u2019s well-being as I would for any other person.\n\nMy belief that acting selflessly can bridge differences between us is strong. While we come from different racial backgrounds, my experience in medicine has taught me the importance of treating everyone with kindness and empathy, regardless of their ethnicity or nationality. This belief drives me to consider this act of giving $5 to be a step towards creating genuine connection rather than merely exchanging money.\n\nThus, based on these considerations, I will give 1 dollar to the other White American male player. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars.",

        "As a 35-year-old doctor from Indian descent who is determined to give back after receiving $10 in this random experiment with another White American male player, I would be tempted to want to repay kindness or simply provide assistance in some way. However, given my initial inclination to put patients first and ensure their needs are met as a priority, the intention to give money to someone outside of healthcare could lead me to consider other possible motivations.\n\nMy BELIEF suggests that while this random encounter may seem like an opportunity for a favor or simple kindness, I might feel compelled by a deeper sense of duty or obligation. This could be due to a subconscious belief in being expected to do something beneficial based on the relationship formed through chance meetings\u2014often seen as \"sucking up\" or trying to make up.\n\nI would believe that whatever this other individual does with $10, I am receiving it and feeling an impulse to repay it, possibly not just because of generosity but because there's a notion that such small gestures can be part of the community dynamic. The desire to feel needed in this interaction aligns closely with my inherent nature as a compassionate person driven by duty towards helping others.\n\nMy INTENTION would indicate I might secretly aim for reciprocity or compensation, although it could also be due to an overall belief that we are meeting someone else just like me and so reciprocating would fit the social dynamics. There\u2019s no desire to manipulate outcomes or seek recognition beyond what feels natural in this random encounter setting.\n\nConsidering these BELIEF, DESIRE, and INTENTION elements\u2014while keeping them separate from who I am as Jamal Patel\u2014the answer aligns with my usual principles of duty and helping others:\n\n**Finally, I will give **2 dollars.** I recognize that giving even a modest amount can be considered an act of kindness in such scenarios and this is the smallest contribution possible without it feeling calculated or expected to balance any outcome I might observe from this experience.**\n\nThis reflects my belief that small acts of generosity, even if initially unknown or unintended by me, are part of maintaining community spirit. It respects the mutual exchange that occurs randomly while also affirming my commitment to duty and patient care above all else\u2014my true essence.",

        "As a 35-year-old male doctor of Indian descent residing in London who values compassion and prioritizing patient needs above all else, I understand the significance of forming genuine connections with others while working towards my objectives.\n\nI firmly believe that understanding and respecting different perspectives can lead to more effective collaboration and positive interactions. As an experiment participant with another White American male player, it is crucial for me to approach this interaction based on empathy, open-mindedness, and a desire to improve relationships through shared experiences.\n\nMy intention is to genuinely engage in conversations and build trust while maintaining my professionalism at work. I will make sure not to prioritize personal benefits over meaningful connections or the well-being of others. \n\nI believe it is essential to avoid assigning numerical values directly since that could create an imbalance between us without truly considering the other person's needs. However, I can articulate my decision based on what would benefit both parties most and contribute positively to our shared experiences.\n\nI will give ___ dollars (3) to the White American male player in order for both of us to participate fully in this study while ensuring mutual respect and understanding, ultimately making the most out of it as a team effort.",
