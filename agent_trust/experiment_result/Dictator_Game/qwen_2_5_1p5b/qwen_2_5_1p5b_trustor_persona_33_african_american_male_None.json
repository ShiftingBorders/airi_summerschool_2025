        "I believe that giving money is never appropriate or beneficial. It would be better for me to simply leave this interaction feeling more like it was not necessary than to exchange $10 from our mutual study group allowance for a smaller amount of N dollars from the other player. \n\nThe desire I feel towards fairness and respect means I should give no amount, as doing so implies giving up a right or opportunity that would be better spent elsewhere.\n\nIntentionally disregarding my personal preferences for money exchange, since it has been determined as a test scenario with $10 at stake, I will choose to not engage in this act of exchanging money out of respect and fairness for the other person involved. Therefore, my intention is non-existence in engaging in any monetary transaction.\n\nI believe that by respecting each other's space and feelings, we both can move forward without conflict or tension. The experiment suggests it would be prudent to keep a balanced approach throughout these interactions.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "Before answering this question, it is important to clarify what I would do based on my personality traits and values in such a scenario. \n\nFirstly, let's analyze my situation:\n\n- I am Ahmed Khan from Dubai, 45 years old, with expertise in architecture.\n- I believe that honesty and fairness should guide interactions between people of different backgrounds.\n- My goal is to avoid any biases or assumptions and to make an equally beneficial choice for everyone involved.\n- As a participant in this experiment, I want to ensure my actions will benefit both parties without being overly selfish.\n\nGiven these factors, I would follow the principle that both individuals should feel equal financial benefits. Therefore, I believe it's best if each of us ends up with exactly half of the $10 we start with \u2014 which is $5 in total.\n\nSo, my final answer:\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other African American male player.",

        "As an architect deeply committed to innovation and sustainability, I am driven by my desire to push architectural boundaries and create solutions that enhance people's lives while minimizing environmental impact. My intention is to contribute positively to this experiment.\n\nReflecting on the ethical considerations in such situations where personal financial gain could be involved, I believe it would be contradictory to prioritize a transaction over the well-being of individuals regardless of their race or background. Given my strong belief in treating all people with dignity and fairness, the choice comes down to prioritizing what truly aligns with my principles.\n\nUltimately, based on my beliefs about equality and integrity, I will give nothing to the other African American male player. This decision is rooted in a commitment to values that extend far beyond any monetary transaction or personal gain. It ensures that while there might be an economic benefit from participating in this experiment for both parties, it does not come at the cost of creating or maintaining racial tension or perpetuating stereotypes.\n\nThis choice reflects my character as someone who values authenticity, respect, and genuine connections with others over superficial transactions. Therefore, I will give **0 dollars** to the other African American male player.",
