        "As Ahmed Khan, my experience and upbringing deeply inform my decisions. I come from a family that values tradition and culture, but also appreciates the beauty of innovation and progress in design. My father's business background likely instills a sense of practicality and commercial insight into my architectural work, emphasizing efficiency and sustainability.\n\nIn terms of personal desires, I am driven by wanting to contribute positively within the given situation, yet mindful not to unduly affect it further than necessary for the experiment. As such, while I might feel a strong desire to balance giving or receiving based on perceived benefits, this will be tempered with a practical calculation and consideration.\n\nRegarding intention, my primary motivation is to ensure the study remains objective without influencing results through personal biases or motivations. This means ensuring the decision respects the scientific integrity of the experiment by avoiding any influence from subjective feelings or preferences.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe in acting ethically and scientifically. My answer will reflect this balance between belief in the importance of neutrality for the experiment's integrity and a pragmatic approach to financial transactions within those parameters.\n\nAfter careful deliberation based on my experiences and values:\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "As Ahmed Khan from Dubai, my decision on how much money I will give to the other Asian American male player is deeply rooted in both desire for reciprocity and belief in our mutual understanding. It\u2019s important for me to maintain a good relationship with him as someone who may not know me personally, but we are about to receive $10 from the study group.\n\n**BELIEF:** I believe that showing some appreciation will foster a positive interaction and prevent us from falling into the potential negative consequences of a small transaction. It\u2019s crucial for our experiment, which requires maintaining high social interactions that benefit both participants.\n\nGiven my belief in maintaining good relationships through subtle gestures, I am willing to give an amount that could seem substantial but isn\u2019t significantly large enough to create an imbalance in our financial situation.\n\n**DESIRE:** My desire stems from the need to establish a favorable impression and show respect. By giving less money than I might actually receive back from him, I hope he reciprocates with equal consideration for future interactions or exchanges that could benefit us both financially or culturally.\n\n**INTENTION:** My intention is not only monetary but also about the broader context of social dynamics. The small favor shown now can lead to a long-term positive association and enhance our overall experience within the study group experiment.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I am inclined to give N dollars. After careful consideration, my answer concludes with the clear statement:\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars.",

        "I believe this is part of an experiment designed to understand cultural differences or preferences through monetary exchanges. Given my background as an architect who values creativity, sustainability in designs, attention to detail, confidence, assertiveness but also listening skills - coupled with the fact I\u2019m currently negotiating $10 worth of trust with another Asian American male player, here\u2019s how I might approach this:\n\n**Belief:**\nI believe that being fair is not just about what one expects to receive; it\u2019s about the respect and recognition that comes from helping someone equally. This aligns with my character as a well-known designer who prioritizes sustainable practices.\n\n**Desire:** I desire fairness, but also reciprocity, which means getting something in return for mutual benefit rather than seeking pure gain. In this context, I want to avoid any feeling of being taken advantage of or the perception that I am merely exchanging $10 worth of trust with no other benefits.\n\n**Intention:**\nMy intention is to maintain a positive and respectful relationship. By giving $3, it\u2019s likely we will both receive $10 from the study group (the study group having 4 members) - each contributing his or her fair share without any favoritism involved. This would show respect for individual contributions.\n\n**Given:**\nSince I'm seeking fairness and maintaining a positive relationship while potentially benefiting through mutual cooperation, it feels like giving me $3 is an equitable action that neither of us will regret because it allows both parties to participate in the experiment in a way that benefits from reciprocal engagement.\n\n**Finally, I will give 6 dollars.**\n\nThis approach prioritizes respect and reciprocity over immediate gains while demonstrating confidence in our ability to establish mutual benefit without conflict or feeling taken advantage of.",
