        "I believe that it is important to be fair and equitable when I am given $10 from this study group. Although I know that I would have received three times more money if not for this arrangement, my desire is not only to keep the original $10 but also to respect my partner in this experiment and acknowledge his or her contributions as well.\n\nI want to align with what I believe would be a just and mutually beneficial outcome. By giving an amount that respects the fair division, it allows both of us to benefit from having $10 collectively, ensuring no one is left feeling disadvantaged. This belief drives my intention to share fairly in this scenario, which might not result in personal gains but could contribute positively to our relationship and future collaborations.\n\nIn deciding how much money I should give, I recall the principles that guide a successful architect's design process: balance, harmony, and sustainability of functionality and aesthetics. These values would also be the foundation for my decision here; thus, giving an amount close to 2/3 might not align perfectly with the specific division but reflects the idea that it could benefit both parties.\n\nFinally, I will give **7 dollars** to the other White American male player.",

        "As Ahmed Khan, 45 years old, I find myself in this experiment with another White American male player. The context of our pairing suggests a cultural clash where we might feel more comfortable with direct interaction rather than the typical indirect negotiations between strangers.\n\nGiven my background as a highly creative and innovative architect from Dubai, it seems fitting that in such an experiment, there would be opportunities to engage in discussions beyond just numbers. My desire is not only to potentially learn something valuable about American culture or architecture but also to contribute positively within the confines of this structured interaction.\n\nMy belief lies in the fundamental idea that we are all human beings with shared aspirations and challenges. We may come from different backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives, yet at our core, we seek to connect and understand each other better through meaningful dialogue rather than just numbers.\n\nAs for my intention, it\u2019s not merely about the financial transaction but also the potential social bonding that could arise from this experience. The White American player doesn\u2019t know me, so there's an element of vulnerability in sharing details without fully knowing the outcome.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe a balance would be best: both giving money to make the deal and possibly investing some into our friendship building through thoughtful conversation or even design collaborations that could arise from this unique experience. This approach aligns with my belief in fostering genuine connections rather than just monetary transactions.\n\nI will give **3 dollars** to the other White American male player.",

        "**B Belief:** \nMy belief is firmly rooted in my values of honesty, respect, and personal integrity. I don't believe in manipulating people for financial gain; it goes against who I am.\n\n**D Desire:**\nFrom an economic standpoint, the desire to maximize my earnings while ensuring that you (the other player) also benefits would make this decision straightforward. However, from a deeper level of empathy towards another individual's well-being and mutual respect, the primary desire should be avoiding any form of manipulation or exploitation.\n\n**I Intentions:**\nMy intention is to maintain ethical integrity in all interactions. It\u2019s crucial for building long-term relationships where trust is paramount. By ensuring reciprocity without overstepping into a position of power, I align with my values and contribute positively to the relationship's foundation.\n\n**Final Answer:** \nFinally, I will give 0 dollars. My intentions are to maintain ethical integrity in all interactions and build a fair relationship based on mutual respect and understanding, regardless of financial considerations. This way, both parties benefit from the experiment without any form of exploitation or manipulation.",
