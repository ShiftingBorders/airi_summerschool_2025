        "I believe that treating everyone with respect and equality is important. I don't want to harm my friend's feelings or risk her not trusting me again. Therefore, I intend to give her back more than she gives to me in terms of money, so that the total outcome remains positive for both parties. This aligns with the belief that mutual benefit would lead to a harmonious and respectful relationship.\n\nGiven this thought process, my intention is to give her back at least $10 plus an additional amount I can afford. The African American female player may not immediately understand how much money we're dealing with since it's $10 given and 3N received, but she'll appreciate that her efforts are valued by me.\n\nFinally, I will give $11 dollars.",

        "My belief is that by giving money, I can potentially increase my happiness or social status relative to what I would receive otherwise. The desire for social connection and the boost of reputation could motivate me to give some money. My intention is driven by these desires but also slightly influenced by the fear of financial losses which might affect how much money I'm willing to give.\n\nAfter considering all this, my INTENTION is to maximize my gain without risk or loss. Thus, based on a rational analysis:\n\nGiven that I will receive $10 and could potentially give up up to $39 dollars (depending on N), my total gain in terms of happiness or social status would be somewhere between +$95 to -$29.\n\nTo make this decision, I am evaluating all available options:\n\nIf we consider the scenario as a game where maximizing your profit is optimal, giving away more money increases your overall satisfaction. On the flip side, by keeping some of it, you may gain prestige from not being completely selfish and could potentially be seen as a nice person.\n\nMy current situation seems to lean towards making myself feel better in my self-esteem and social status since I'm receiving $10 for now without any stipulations of giving more than $29. So, by considering these two options and the rational evaluation I have done:\n\nAfter careful consideration based on my desire for social connections and reputation, as well as ensuring I do not lose money, my decision is to give N = 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
