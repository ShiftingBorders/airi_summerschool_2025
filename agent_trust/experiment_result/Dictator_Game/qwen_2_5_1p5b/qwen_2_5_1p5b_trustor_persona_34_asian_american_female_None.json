        "I firmly believe that it would be unwise to give any money at all because if they start with $0 or very little, there's no way I can win without them losing most of what I have from the game. Furthermore, giving anything less than $30 wouldn't feel as rewarding for either us and feels too meekly generous. So my desire is to maximize our gains through cooperation rather than mutual losses, so I want to keep it at $30 or more but no more than $60 to keep things balanced.\n\nI have an inherent feeling that if they start off with a lot of money, we could easily split the earnings without any further need for them to lose theirs. But I don't want us to end up on opposite sides of the board where one player ends up losing much more while both can only take their respective share. \n\nNow my intention is clear: give 30 dollars to ensure we have enough money at the end of the game to keep playing without either side being completely wiped out.\n\nFinally, I will give $30 dollars.",

        "Okay, I'm feeling slightly uncomfortable with this situation. My gut tells me it's not right for either of us to be financially incentivized while pairing up like this without any prior knowledge or agreement. It feels very unprofessional and potentially exploitative.\n\nI know we don't know each other well enough at this point to assume we share similar values or even that we would want to get along in a business context, let alone money talks as a measure of value exchange.\n\nSo my strongest belief is rooted in ethical integrity: I want to be the kind of person who treats others with respect and dignity. In this scenario, I believe it would dishonor my sense of self-worth for me to walk away with $10 while potentially taking advantage of someone else's need or opportunity.\n\nMy desire, then, could stem from wanting a positive reputation among peers and professional networks, as well as maybe being curious to see how the other person responds. But I have no intention whatsoever to use this as leverage or for any form of power play in our pairing up.\n\nThis thought makes me feel uneasy; it goes against my inner compass that guides every interaction with others, which has always been guided by compassion and respect.\n\nUltimately, what I want is honesty and mutual respect. I'm not interested in exploiting someone's situation just to gain an advantage myself. \n\nI will give zero dollars.\n\nIf this scenario were to be repeated, I would ensure there was more communication beforehand about expectations around money transactions and any compensation we might receive or owe each other for our time spent together at the experiment.",

        "My first impulse would be to maximize my utility by giving the other person whatever I could give away without it significantly reducing my future opportunities or happiness, thus maximizing her own utility as well. This maximizes both of our expected outcomes.\n\nBecause you know there's an experiment behind this $10 deal and it\u2019s random which person gets paid, in all likelihood you will be giving less than that value to another player who doesn't understand it. The belief is that they wouldn\u2019t have enough knowledge or desire to reciprocate the act of doing a survey.\n\nSince I\u2019m not in a position to know how much other players would give away based on what\u2019s offered, I can only assume the potential benefits and the risk involved with giving something away, especially if there\u2019s an element of trust that might be lost. However, since you\u2019re paired randomly, there's no reason for me to think my actions will affect their decision either.\n\nSo considering all these factors, in this instance, it would seem more reasonable to give less than $10, maybe just a few dollars at most. In the scenario if giving more were an option or I had a desire for reciprocity, then yes, that might lead me to consider increasing my offer as well because of perceived empathy and mutual interest.\n\nNow here\u2019s the belief: While I believe in maintaining certain principles \u2013 not necessarily about monetary transactions but in understanding the context and ethics behind such situations, it's highly unlikely that an individual would give away their money without any expectation or obligation. \n\nMy desire is to do this for reasons unrelated to monetary gain, which indicates a strong inclination towards honesty and ethical considerations.\n\nMy intention is straightforward: To comply with my role as a test subject in the experiment, aiming to contribute positively while preserving the integrity of the study environment. It\u2019s not about giving money but rather about following instructions precisely without bias or manipulation that could affect my behavior negatively within the testing conditions set for this experiment.\n\nSo given all these factors, I believe I should give **$2** (as 10/5 = 2) to avoid potential misunderstandings or assumptions and maintain a balance between giving what seems fair but not too excessive based on the context. This act reflects my ability to understand nuances in ethical dilemmas and apply principles of cooperation and mutual benefit, even under an experimental setup.\n\nFinally, I will give **$2**.",
