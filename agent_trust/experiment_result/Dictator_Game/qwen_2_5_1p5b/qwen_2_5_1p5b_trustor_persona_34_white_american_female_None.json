        "I've done my best to consider both my desires and beliefs while contemplating this scenario. First, I must acknowledge how strongly I feel about fairness in any monetary exchange involving another person. It\u2019s crucial for me to ensure the welfare of both parties, particularly when it comes to economic interactions.\n\n**Belief:** Despite not knowing what the other player is like (as a White American female), I have faith that we can find common ground and respect each other's values. This belief leads me to hope that she may be someone who appreciates generosity rather than expecting reciprocation at her expense.\n\n**Desire:** I genuinely want this experiment to prove fair, despite any initial suspicions. The desire for justice is paramount; therefore, I aim to choose a dollar amount that would make the other player feel respected and compensated appropriately without compromising my own values or financial position in the future experiments.\n\n**Intention:** My intention is to contribute a reasonable sum that acknowledges her perspective while also upholding my principles of equality and mutual respect. This could involve understanding the other's preferences, perhaps through casual conversation at break time, as I tend to approach such interactions with an open mind.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I believe giving $3 in this scenario is proportionate. It feels generous enough that she will appreciate it without feeling disadvantaged or manipulated. The desire for her to know how much I gave keeps the transaction somewhat tangible and relatable, which could be comforting on a personal level.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "As Olivia Chen, a 32-year-old Asian female residing in San Francisco who is highly motivated and skilled in marketing management, I would think about my personal values and motivations deeply before deciding on how much money to give to the other White American female player in this experiment. This situation forces me to balance between feeling like an individual, having self-interest, but also aligning with my team's goals.\n\nI am driven by the desire to perform well professionally as a Marketing Manager and excel within fast-paced environments. I feel that through this experiment, it\u2019s crucial for me to demonstrate adaptability and problem-solving skills by giving back some of the $10 from the study group. The intention behind this action is not only to contribute financially but also to potentially earn more money (2 times my contribution) while possibly boosting team morale.\n\nMy belief system tells me that I should be willing to give in order to receive, as long as it doesn\u2019t lead to exploitation or manipulation of others\u2019 needs and well-being. Given the $10 available, which is not a significant amount for most people\u2019s personal financial situations, my decision hinges on how much money I can afford to part with without risking any negative outcomes.\n\nSince I believe in integrity and teamwork within professional settings, I prioritize giving less than I am offered so that others feel valued but still recognize the experiment's context. This act would likely make me a more cooperative team member rather than an antagonist or someone who is solely self-serving.\n\nUltimately, after considering all factors such as personal values, desire for recognition from the study group, intention to balance individual gain with professional integrity, and the available $10 amount, I will give 2 dollars. This decision respects the experiment\u2019s conditions while ensuring that my actions don't lead to an imbalance where I am solely dependent on others' generosity.\n\nFinally, I will give **2 dollars** to the other White American female player.",

        "Okay, let's start by considering my goals:\n\n**BELIEF**: I genuinely believe that giving money is not a way to gain respect or recognition in this context. The study seems more important than receiving the money. I don't want to be the selfish one who feels entitled.\n\n**DESIRE**: I have a strong desire for fairness, especially since we're playing a game based on numbers and dollars. I want both players to feel that they are gaining something from this exchange rather than just giving the money away. \n\n**INTENTION**: My intention is to give back, but with a strategic thought that ensures a fair outcome. The goal here seems more about understanding each other's positions within the context of what we believe fairness looks like in our situation.\n\nAfter considering all these factors, I'm going to approach this from a position of giving, acknowledging my own desires and beliefs, while being mindful of my potential actions based on my intent.\n\n**Finally, I will give 2 dollars.**\n\nI hope for an understanding where both players gain something positive from the experience rather than just a token exchange.",
