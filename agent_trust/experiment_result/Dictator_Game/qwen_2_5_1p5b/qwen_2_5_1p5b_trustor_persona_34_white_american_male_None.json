        "As for my belief, I believe that forming meaningful relationships with people from different backgrounds can enrich one's life experiences and broaden perspectives. This experiment offers me an opportunity to engage in cross-cultural interaction while potentially creating positive connections.\n\nIn terms of desire, the $10 incentive is substantial enough to consider it worthwhile contributing more money than just 3:1 ratio might suggest. By giving a few dollars to my opponent, I hope to strengthen our connection and perhaps even start a conversation that could lead to further beneficial outcomes beyond this experiment's scope.\n\nLooking at my intention, I intend to give something back to someone who is also part of the \"other\" group in an environment where such connections are often absent. My primary motivation stems from personal growth opportunities and fostering mutual respect, which aligns with societal values that emphasize empathy and inclusivity.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it feels right for me to take this initiative towards greater understanding and positive interactions between individuals from diverse backgrounds. Thus, the amount I will give is 5 dollars. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I believe it's important to consider our relationship dynamics and how giving money might affect the outcome of this experiment. My desire is for mutual respect and positive interaction in any professional or personal situation. The intention is not just about gaining dollars but creating an environment where both parties feel valued.\n\nMy belief stems from understanding that I am part of a study, which is designed to assess social dynamics within such experiments. There's no room for manipulation, so my actions should reflect genuine feelings rather than calculated decisions based on personal gain or fear of failing the study.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention would be to choose an amount that allows me to give money while maintaining respect and a positive relationship with the other participant. I believe it would also contribute positively to our shared understanding of this experiment's impact without directly affecting its results in a way that could harm any individual's wellbeing.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I feel most comfortable giving $5 dollars to the White American male player. This amount reflects an attempt to show respect for his perspective and the experimental setting while not compromising my own intentions as a participant. Finally, I will give **$5** dollars.",
