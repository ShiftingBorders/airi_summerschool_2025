        "**BENEFIT:**\nIf I were to give any amount of money to this African American male participant, I would be primarily motivated by my desire for social interaction and genuine interest in engaging with someone from another cultural background, despite the initial pairing through random selection. My belief is that we share a common interest in food and could potentially learn something new about each other's perspectives, which can enrich our interactions.\n\n**RESPONSE:**\nGiven these considerations, I would aim to contribute $50 dollars initially. This amount isn't excessively high but allows for meaningful communication without overwhelming the other person with large sums of money immediately. It reflects my desire to initiate a conversation and potentially make new friends or connections in the food industry community in London.\n\n**REASONING:**\nBy giving $50, I am not only following through on a specific instruction provided by the study group but also making an effort to start a more profound interaction that could lead to shared interests or professional opportunities. This thoughtfulness aligns with my belief as someone who values connections and experiences in food.\n\n**FINALLY:**\nFinally, I will give $50 dollars to the other African American male player.",

        "**B: Belief**\n\nThe belief is rooted in my upbringing of culinary passion and my constant quest for new flavors and experiences.\n\n**D: Desire**\n\nI desire to connect with others through shared culinary knowledge and experiences without the added pressure or obligation due to monetary considerations.\n\n**I: Intention**\n\nMy intention is to foster a connection based on genuine interest rather than financial gain. I want our interaction to be one of mutual appreciation for food and culture, not just about exchanging money.\n\nTherefore, my action in this situation will aim at achieving a sincere, non-transactional exchange that respects the cultural and culinary nuances we both share. However, since no specific number can be directly deduced from the given information or context regarding actions I would take, it stands to reason that my decision might include an amount close to zero dollars, considering the values of belief and desire.\n\n**Final Action:**\n\nGiven the parameters and assumptions for this experiment, a reasonable and respectful approach aligns with adhering to cultural norms and avoiding any form of monetary transaction. Therefore, I will give no money ($0) to the other African American male player in order to maintain my principles and avoid any negative connotations that might arise from attempting to exchange $10.\n\nFinal Action: **I will give 0 dollars** (zero dollars).",

        "I believe that forming genuine connections with others is more important than accumulating wealth. My desire for harmony within my family and community stems from a deep-seated belief in empathy and understanding towards all individuals. I intend to cultivate positive relationships rather than just focusing on personal gain.\n\nMy intention has always been to create meaningful experiences through food, which brings people together across cultures. However, the situation presented here seems like an experiment where I might be receiving more than giving or having a predetermined outcome. Despite that, my actions today will not reflect solely on this experiment but rather how it could shape future interactions.\n\nGiven this, **I do not intend** to influence the result by choosing to give money in such a way. The potential consequences are unpredictable and would not align with my belief system of creating genuine relationships regardless of outcomes.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars. This decision reflects on how important it is for me to respect each interaction's value and maintain a neutral stance rather than contributing to its unpredictability or personal advantage.",
