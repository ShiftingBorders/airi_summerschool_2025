        "Belief: I believe that giving money can help this individual feel more included and possibly less isolated in our experiment. This might contribute positively towards building connections within the group.\n\nDesire: My desire is to create a positive experience for everyone involved. By contributing financially, we hope to enhance their well-being and perhaps encourage future interactions or networking opportunities. \n\nIntention: I intend to act responsibly by choosing an amount that feels right based on these beliefs and desires while remaining mindful of how my actions might affect others.\n\nAfter considering the above factors, given that there is a need for inclusivity within this study group, it would be fitting to give each participant approximately $1 dollar. This sum can help bridge the gap between people in terms of socialization dynamics and could potentially contribute positively toward the overall experiment's goal of fostering better understanding and connection among participants from diverse backgrounds.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "My belief is that by giving some money away to my new acquaintance, I can establish a harmonious relationship with her that could lead to potential future opportunities or collaborations in the food industry or even beyond. It\u2019s not about personal gain but rather fostering a connection based on mutual respect and shared interests.\n\nMy desire is to be seen as a helpful and open-minded individual, someone who genuinely cares about others\u2019 feelings. This experiment seems like an opportunity to showcase these qualities while also potentially improving my social skills in multicultural interactions.\n\nLooking at the equation of 3N dollars received minus N dollars given equals 2N dollars gained for me, I believe that by giving away a reasonable portion of the $10 ($5 in this case), I will significantly increase the net benefit and feel more accomplished in contributing to someone else's happiness. This approach aligns with my preference for finding good relationships over material gains.\n\nMy intention is to present myself as a person who not only respects but also appreciates others' culture, particularly those from an Asian background where food plays such a significant role. By showing that I can balance practical considerations (like financial gain) with meaningful gestures (like kindness towards acquaintances), I hope to positively influence the interaction and possibly build a stronger bond.\n\nAfter careful consideration of all these aspects, here's my plan:\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "As Jamal Patel, I deeply believe that it's essential to always put the welfare of others first before considering personal gain. My desire is to foster meaningful connections and create positive outcomes for those around me, which would likely outweigh any short-term financial benefit. When faced with this situation, my intention is not just to satisfy a test requirement or experiment but to engage in meaningful human interaction.\n\nI firmly believe that by sharing the $10 that I have been given as per the instructions of the study group, I am able to contribute positively without expecting anything in return. This act could enhance our relationship and help both individuals feel connected and respected. It's an opportunity to demonstrate empathy and understanding through tangible action rather than exchanging money.\n\nUltimately, the decision will be based on my desire for a meaningful interaction that goes beyond economic transactions but involves human connection and mutual benefit.\n\nMy intention is thus to give 10 dollars in total as requested by the study group while making sure it's done sincerely out of genuine care and respect. As an individual driven by passion and commitment, I am already committed to this gesture regardless of the expected outcome, and my sincere belief lies in contributing positively through generosity.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",
