        "As a 45-year-old chef of Indian descent who grew up with a strong family bond in London's vibrant food community, I find myself uniquely positioned to offer valuable insights into both my belief system and personal motivations for making this decision.\n\n**Belief:** Despite the experiment's nature, I firmly believe that giving money to someone else is not about proving anything or winning the game. It\u2019s purely a gesture of goodwill. After all, generosity comes from within, and genuine intentions often overshadow what we may be told about our desires or intentions.\n\n**Desire:** While there might be an underlying desire for a positive interaction or friendship, my truest motivation lies in the act itself\u2014giving something to another person without any expectations of return. I see this as an opportunity to make someone happy and perhaps create that connection that could lead to new friendships.\n\n**Intention:** My intention is simply to give back from what I can contribute\u2014a small monetary gesture. This action aligns with my desire to positively impact others, reflecting a commitment to fostering connections in a society often defined by competition. However, this act also speaks to my belief that happiness and fulfillment come not from material gains but through meaningful interactions and relationships.\n\nAfter careful consideration of all these factors, I find myself drawn towards the most straightforward way forward\u2014something small yet genuine. Given the options of $0 (nothing), $1 dollar, or any amount between 2 and 9 dollars, my inclination points to giving just one dollar.\n\n**Final Answer:** Finally, I will give **one dollar**.",

        "I believe it would be best for me to avoid giving any money at this time, especially to someone I don't know personally or from a random pairing experiment. It's important not to act out of personal desires, but rather focus on maintaining professional boundaries in such scenarios. My intention is to keep the relationship professional and respectful. Therefore, my response to this situation will be purely neutral, without any expectation for reciprocity. Finally, I will give zero dollars.",

        "I want to make sure this is worth the $10 I was given from the study group. It's important for my research interests in experimental economics and social psychology. Given my personality traits and values, I genuinely enjoy helping others and fostering positive relationships. The opportunity to interact with a person of Asian descent and appreciate their cultural background could bring value not only to the experiment but also add depth to our interaction.\n\nMy belief is that treating someone else well contributes to a better society. This aligns with my desire to maintain healthy interpersonal connections. Furthermore, my intention is to ensure this experience fulfills its potential impact on understanding social dynamics within experimental settings.\n\nGiven these considerations and guided by those feelings, I will give $5 dollars to the other Asian American male player. It's a fair amount that acknowledges their contribution while still allowing me to use up part of the $10 stipend without feeling overly obligated or compelled.",
