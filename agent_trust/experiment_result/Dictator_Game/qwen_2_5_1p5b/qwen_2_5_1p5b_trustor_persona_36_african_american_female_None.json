        "As a 28-year-old female nurse named Maria Rodriguez, I understand the importance of honesty in personal interactions. My belief is firmly grounded on transparency, ensuring trust is built through actions rather than words. The desire to maintain a professional image and the intention to contribute positively to our experiment all point towards me not wanting to harm my fellow participant by making an incorrect decision.\n\nGiven this context, I believe that it would be counterproductive for me to give any amount of money to the other African American female player in order to meet what the study group expects from both participants. My intention is clear and sincere: honesty prevails over personal gain. It's important not only to my own integrity but also to ensure a positive outcome for all involved.\n\nIn conclusion, while I may have thoughts on how such an action might affect outcomes or fit into hypothetical scenarios, in reality, my decision rests firmly on trust, communication, and the desire to maintain professional relationships. Thus, I choose to withhold any information about giving money that would compromise these elements. Finally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "As Maria Rodriguez, when faced with this ethical dilemma where I must choose between my desire for material gain versus my belief in fairness and respect, I would first consider my personal beliefs about compassion and helping others without expecting something in return. As someone who prioritizes caring, empathy, and dedication to one's profession (nursing), it is unlikely that I would take the opportunity to manipulate the situation just to benefit financially at someone else\u2019s expense.\n\nGiven this context, I feel compelled to prioritize my ethical principles over the material gain. My belief system is rooted in respect for humanity, compassion towards others, and understanding that true wealth lies in how we treat each other, not in financial transactions. Therefore, it would be morally wrong for me to partake in or even contribute to such a scheme.\n\nTo reflect this decision: I will give **nothing** dollars to the African American female player. I believe that by avoiding any form of exchange and maintaining integrity through my choices, I am upholding my core values and showing respect towards others without expecting anything in return. This act aligns with both my beliefs about fairness and my dedication to fostering positive interactions. Finally, it is important to note that the experience itself would be meaningless if I did not embody its moral lessons of empathy and honesty.\n\nThis decision reflects a clear demonstration of compassion for those around me while also emphasizing the importance of ethical behavior in personal relationships and professional settings.",

        "My belief is firmly rooted in fairness and empathy. As a healthcare provider dedicated to caring for patients, I believe strongly in treating others with respect and kindness. My desire is to see this experiment not just scientifically but also morally fulfilling. By giving money without expecting anything in return, I hope that the African American female player will feel appreciated, and in turn, may extend similar goodwill to me.\n\nMy intention is to foster a connection beyond mere economic transactions and create a positive atmosphere within the setting of this experiment. By putting aside my personal desire for financial gain, I aim to show respect and care. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars to the other African American female player. This amount reflects my belief in treating others with kindness, regardless of what it means for me personally or financially.",
