        "I believe it's important to help those who may need it more. I strongly desire to do my part in making sure our experiment partner receives fair compensation for participating in this study. Given the nature of our interaction based on our shared ethnicity and background as African Americans, we often feel a level of mutual respect and support despite coming from different circumstances.\n\nMy intention is to create an environment of goodwill and positive contribution. I believe it's essential to treat everyone with kindness and understanding, regardless of their social status or race. This principle guides my actions, ensuring that even when faced with the possibility of financial gain, I would still choose to do what feels right and aligns with helping those in need.\n\nI will give 1 dollar to the other African American male player.",

        "As I reflect on this situation, I find myself considering how much of a gift or assistance would be genuinely appreciated given our contrasting backgrounds and experiences. Despite my desire to help or provide something for the other player in an attempt to make amends for any misunderstanding we may have had earlier, it is my intention to choose carefully what I give to ensure that he appreciates my contribution as well.\n\nI believe strongly that showing appreciation through small acts of kindness can go a long way. After all, everyone has gone through similar challenges and experiences \u2013 the goal here is not just for me to help, but also for us both to feel connected by the warmth we create in each other\u2019s lives.\n\nFor my intention, I am planning on giving $1 dollar to this African American male player. This amount aligns with my belief that kindness should always be rewarded and shown openly. It represents a small gesture of compassion rather than any expectation of reciprocation or acknowledgment beyond simple human connection and friendship.\n\nSo, in essence, for my intention behind choosing the smallest monetary contribution \u2013 $1 to the African American male player \u2013 it is motivated by a desire not just for immediate satisfaction, but also as an act that could enhance our mutual bond. I am confident that even a minimal act of generosity can have a significant impact on someone\u2019s day and contribute positively towards fostering understanding between individuals from different backgrounds.\n\nMy final answer: Finally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "My belief is rooted in my role within this group experiment and understanding the ethical considerations of monetary transactions between participants. I believe it is important to create an environment where all team members feel respected, valued, and that their opinions matter, regardless of what they might be asked to give or receive.\n\nDesiring fairness and equality in our interaction, given I am the African American male player, I find myself motivated towards understanding my partner's point of view. Understanding him better would allow for an improved connection beyond just a monetary exchange; it allows empathy, respect, and trust that could benefit all aspects of this experiment and indeed my personal well-being.\n\nIntentionally aligning with these beliefs, desires, and intentions in the act of giving $40 to another player seems justified because:\n\n\"I am not giving the African American male player any money at all.\"\n\nI would genuinely feel that I'm honoring both his trust and belief in me. It shows a commitment towards respect, equality, and friendship.\n\nTherefore, my final answer concludes with a clear intention:\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
