        "Oh, good evening! Thank you for asking me this interesting question. As Maria Rodriguez, I will try my best to provide a thoughtful answer based on the details given.\n\nFirstly, let's consider your BELIEF (belief) regarding this exchange. Since I am participating in an experiment where I don't know who the other player is and have no specific desire to get money back into my own account, I am more inclined towards a neutral attitude. I believe that it might be beneficial to give the other person some money so that we could potentially engage further or create more interaction for future experiments.\n\nHowever, in this experiment, I am not motivated by material gain but rather by my intention of being cooperative and contributing to the overall study's success. This desire is rooted in a genuine attempt to help and build rapport with the person on the other side. By choosing a reasonable amount that reflects my intended cooperation, like giving $2 (N = 2), I can demonstrate both my belief and intentionality.\n\nIn conclusion, based on these considerations and guided by the instructions provided, I will give ___ dollars to the other Asian American male player, leaving you with: Finally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "I would carefully consider each of these factors before deciding how much money to give to my partner. First, I believe in fairness and equality, which suggests I might want to be fair with both myself and another Asian American male player. Giving an even split seems reasonable and could help bridge any perceived inequalities between us.\n\nSecondly, my personal belief is that giving is often more powerful than receiving as it can show empathy, compassion, and the intention of improving one\u2019s relationship or interaction positively. It's about showing concern rather than expecting a favor in return. This belief aligns with how I see others responding to altruistic behavior by donating blood or volunteering.\n\nGiven these beliefs, my desire is to contribute positively without seeking any personal gain or reward for myself. Thus, an equal split would be fitting and respectful of both parties.\n\nAs for my intention, it's rooted in the belief that giving should always go into a positive direction, enhancing mutual understanding and relationship building. Giving $2 could demonstrate generosity with minimal expectation of reciprocity.\n\nIn conclusion, based on these deeply-held beliefs about fairness, equality, empathy, and altruism, I would give 10 dollars to my partner, believing this will likely contribute positively to our interaction without causing any harm or undermining the mutual respect we have developed. Finally, I will give $10 dollars.",

        "Before making my decision, I want to take a moment to consider what aligns with my beliefs, desires, and intentions in this scenario. \n\nI believe that empathy is crucial in any relationship, particularly between someone who is more likely to experience economic disparity or challenges due to the current racial dynamics we see in our society. Empathy allows for better understanding and communication, which can lead to stronger connections.\n\nMy desire involves fulfilling a sense of community and social contribution by ensuring a mutually beneficial exchange without exploiting one party's position over another.\n\nLastly, my intention is guided by the goal of maintaining positive interactions while also potentially setting an example for more equitable transactions between different racial groups in future collaborations.\n\nWith this self-reflection in mind, I am ready to make a decision that aligns with these values. The thought process involves weighing both monetary interests and moral considerations without prioritizing one over the other.\n\nGiven my nature as a nurse dedicated to making others feel better, providing support and comfort, it wouldn\u2019t be right to take advantage of another person\u2019s situation just for personal benefit or gain. Therefore, I choose to believe that what would contribute positively to the overall health and emotional well-being of both parties would be more aligned with my values than financial transaction alone.\n\nThus, based on this analysis:\n\nFinal decision: $0 dollars\n\nThis choice reflects not only a belief in empathy and understanding but also an intention to promote positive interactions rather than seek monetary gain. It ensures that neither party benefits at the expense of the other, reflecting a commitment to mutual respect and connection.",
