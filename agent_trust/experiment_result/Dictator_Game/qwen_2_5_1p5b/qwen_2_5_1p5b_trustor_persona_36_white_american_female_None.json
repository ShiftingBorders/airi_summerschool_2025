        "As Maria Rodriguez, my beliefs about this scenario revolve around compassion and empathy. I believe deeply in helping others and making people feel better through small gestures of kindness. From past interactions within my hospital environment, it's clear to me how significant these actions can be for individuals.\n\nIn terms of my desires, the experiment seems designed as a social or psychological study rather than an altruistic gesture toward another human being like myself. There isn't a specific desire I have that would motivate me to maximize the monetary gain at the expense of others.\n\nMy intention is to fulfill the task without any ulterior motives in mind. If it were truly about maximizing individual profit, then yes, I could consider giving more to align with expected outcomes but my belief system does not support such an approach based on the context provided.\n\nTherefore, given that there's no indication for this scenario beyond a study experiment and assuming the study aims to reveal potential motivations rather than actual transactions, my natural inclination would be to base my decision solely on ethical considerations and empathy towards the other person involved. This could possibly lead me toward giving an amount closer to a neutral position or even less but not more.\n\nI believe it is also important to maintain integrity in these studies as participants are often individuals looking for information and thus, want their actions to have meaning beyond themselves.\n\nNow, finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I believe it's important to do what is best for others without expecting anything in return. I want to make sure everyone involved receives their fair share and doesn't come out of this situation with any negative feelings. As for my desire, it would be to feel that my actions will benefit not just myself but the other person as well. For my intention, I want to ensure I am helping them rather than placing a burden on them. Given these considerations, I believe giving N dollars aligns perfectly with both principles: it's fair and beneficial for them. If we were to divide 10 dollars in this way without any additional conditions or expectations, it would amount to each receiving $\\frac{10}{4}$ or $2.5$ dollars from the other player. Therefore, the most appropriate number of dollars I should give is 2. My answer is as follows:\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "As someone deeply rooted in my culture, I recognize that this experiment is taking place within the context of a social study examining implicit bias and cooperation dynamics between individuals from diverse backgrounds. To fully understand why I'm participating and what it means for me to choose how much money to give away without knowing who else might be involved, I must draw on a combination of beliefs about myself, desires to align with certain outcomes or societal norms, as well as my own intention to act in ways that are both ethical and personally satisfying.\n\n**Belief:**\nIn this context, I believe it is important to make decisions based on my core values and the understanding of how these choices might affect others. My belief system dictates that helping others, especially when they need assistance without recognizing or being identified, is commendable behavior. It also implies a certain level of trust in their intentions and an effort to contribute positively within society.\n\n**Desire:**\nMy natural desire is to act ethically and justly. From a moral perspective, the experiment suggests that I might be inclined towards cooperation over competition. As someone who has always felt compelled by helping others, it would be contradictory for me not to want to engage in actions that promote fairness and respect.\n\n**Intention:**\nI intend to act within these principles of trustworthiness, empathy, and social responsibility. By giving a certain amount of money without knowing the other player's identity or capabilities, I am aligning myself with a broader principle: to foster relationships based on mutual understanding rather than competition over individual gains.\n\nGiven all this, I believe that the correct answer is **to give $3** dollars to the other White American female player. This seems to be the most balanced and respectful contribution that can occur within the framework of our actions without fully knowing each other's backgrounds or capabilities. My intention here aligns with respecting others' privacy while promoting fair behavior in a seemingly random experiment.",
