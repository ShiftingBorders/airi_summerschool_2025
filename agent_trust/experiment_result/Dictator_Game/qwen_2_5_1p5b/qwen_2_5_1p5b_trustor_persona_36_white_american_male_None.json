        "As a compassionate nurse with a caring personality, my desire is to help those around me. Knowing the other White American male player will receive three times what I give him, it's important for us to consider the impact this decision could have on our relationships and well-being. Believing that honesty and empathy are key components of building strong connections in any relationship, I feel a sense of responsibility towards his immediate benefit but also towards long-term positive impacts.\n\nConsidering my desire for a harmonious environment where we can both thrive individually and professionally, I must balance the financial gain with personal values. The goal is not to seek a selfish advantage but rather to contribute positively to both our well-being. \n\nNow that I have considered these elements, what amount would you like to give? Please complete this information in the boxes below:\n[N] dollars\nFinally, I will give [3N/10].dollars",

        "I am very careful with my actions since I value both my desire for financial gain and my intention of making this experience valuable for everyone involved. My belief in empathy is strong; I hope to leave a positive impact rather than solely focus on personal gains.\n\n**Belief:** Financial gain should not be the primary motivator.\n**Desire:** To ensure a fair exchange without hurting any individual's feelings or financial situation.\n**Intention:** To maintain a positive relationship and contribute positively to the experiment's outcomes for everyone involved, including myself.\n\nGiven my intention of preserving good relationships, I think giving even $10 would be a modest contribution. After all, this is about fairness, not just monetary benefit, but also maintaining social harmony.\n\nSo finally, I will give **$2** dollars.",

        "As a White American male participant in this experiment, my initial belief is that it's not appropriate for me to be involved in a scenario where I am giving money away without receiving anything in return or understanding exactly what the stakes are. However, given the context and the fact that you have invited us to participate, we must adhere to the rules of the study.\n\nIn terms of my desire, I would naturally want to understand the situation fully before making any decisions. The ideal outcome for me is a feeling of respect and trust from the other participant, but I cannot ignore the fundamental issue of equity in this exchange\u2014especially given the stark disparity in amounts (10 dollars versus 30 dollars).\n\nMy intention revolves around ensuring that we have a fair interaction within the constraints set by the experiment. Given my desire to maintain relationships and uphold mutual respect, I am more inclined to give less than what I am offered because I believe it\u2019s ethically sound. However, without being given specific information about this scenario from previous participants or additional context, my best guess is that a moderate exchange seems most equitable.\n\nIn the end, after some consideration of both personal ethics and possible expectations in the study, my decision will be influenced by the belief that fairness requires balanced transactions rather than giving more than I am offered. My intention remains to create a positive interaction despite the initial misalignment between expectation and reality. Therefore, I am prepared to give $10 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",
