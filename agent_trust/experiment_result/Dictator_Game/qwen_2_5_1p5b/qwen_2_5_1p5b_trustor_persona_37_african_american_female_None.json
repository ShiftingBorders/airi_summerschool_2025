        "I'm deeply committed to treating everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their race or background. In today's world, we must strive towards equality in all aspects. The experiment isn't just about money; it goes deeper into understanding each other and fostering relationships across cultures.\n\nBefore I make my decision, let me reflect on my deepest beliefs. As someone who is both assertive and highly analytical, I believe strongly in the importance of fairness and respect. These principles have guided my life and my career as a lawyer, leading to many successful outcomes and positive impacts. I strive for success but not at the expense of others' rights or wellbeing.\n\nNow, considering my goals and intentions, let me weigh my choices: if I were given this $10 opportunity, would it still be appropriate to keep half in this scenario where one's decisions can affect someone else so drastically? I believe that even if the money is small enough to not seem consequential, treating people with empathy and understanding should always outweigh any financial gain.\n\nI don't want to give more than what was given to me. It might appear as an act of generosity, but it also could be seen as an attempt to manipulate situations or create a false sense of well-being. This is why I'll consider giving only $2 out of my $10 gift\u2014half of the initial amount.\n\nFinal decision: 2 dollars.",

        "My initial instinct tells me not to partake in this experiment's game theory aspect of playing \"the other.\" However, after considering my intrinsic beliefs, desires, and intentions, I realize I must act more responsibly, focusing on the long-term ethical benefits of cooperation for both parties.\n\n### Belief: \nI firmly believe that cooperation could lead to mutual benefit, which is essential for a successful career in law. Additionally, as an individual from an affluent background who values social interaction and building rapport, it would be inappropriate to play this game purely out of self-interest.\n\n### Desire:\nIn terms of personal growth and reputation within the legal community, I am highly motivated to make choices that enhance my credibility and ability to offer leadership skills. This is crucial for my career trajectory in Dubai's dynamic legal environment.\n\n### Intention:\nMy intention is to act with integrity and responsibility as a member of this group experiment. It would be dishonorable if any participant were to receive $10 from the study group without providing equivalent value, thereby leading to unethical behavior or social hierarchy manipulation.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars to the other African American female player. This amount aligns with ethical principles and is consistent with my values of leadership and credibility building within my field.",

        "Alright, let me explain my reasoning before I state how much money I will give.\n\n**BELIEF:** I firmly believe that it's better to spread wealth more evenly among us rather than concentrating it in the hands of fewer individuals. As a lawyer and leader, I'm used to advocating for justice and equality, which makes this a strong part of my belief system. \n\n**DESIRE:** While having $10 is important, gaining respect and establishing good connections within one's professional community is more desirable. By showing generosity towards the other African American female player, I'll gain that respect and possibly win her over to form positive relationships with others.\n\n**INTENTION:** My intention involves both a desire for respect from my peers as well as an obligation to consider broader social benefits. I genuinely believe that such actions could help foster stronger bonds and more harmonious interactions within the community.\n\n**To Summarize:**\nGiven these factors, I believe that distributing $3 between us would be beneficial and aligns with my core values of promoting fairer wealth distribution and building positive relationships.\n\nTherefore, I will give 3 dollars to the other African American female player.",
