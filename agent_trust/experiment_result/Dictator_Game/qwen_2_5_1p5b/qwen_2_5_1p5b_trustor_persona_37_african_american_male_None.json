        "My decision to give money to this African American male player is based on my belief that doing so would not negatively impact me or anyone else involved in this study experiment. It is purely out of respect for him and ensuring he feels good about his participation. My desire here might be driven by a genuine attempt at fostering positive relationships, which could benefit our friendship. My intention is to contribute without expecting anything in return except perhaps a sense of personal satisfaction.\n\nNow that I have considered all these factors, my belief in maintaining social harmony dictates giving him no money. There's no reason to give more than what it would cost me financially, and the experiment requires honesty for integrity\u2019s sake. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "I'm going into this experiment with a strong desire for success and respect within my field of law. My main intention is to maximize my personal gain while ensuring I am seen positively by the study group, which includes demonstrating my expertise and negotiating abilities.\n\nIn order to fulfill these intentions effectively, it's crucial that my belief in our partnership aligns well with how we might collaborate on tasks or handle financial transactions like this. The African American male player is likely as cautious of others' motivations as I am of mine, so understanding his perspective would be key.\n\nThe stakes here are high: $10 for me, but if I give more than 3N, the transaction might feel like a bribe. On the other hand, the potential benefit could also make people think that's exactly what he wanted from the beginning\u2014another reason why aligning intentions matters so much in this scenario.\n\nI believe we can find common ground and possibly even mutual respect if I give him $2 dollars upfront. In my negotiation mindset, I would be willing to give a small amount initially just to avoid the perception of being taken advantage of or treated like a lowball offerer.\n\nMy next thought is that it's more likely for both parties to engage in this transaction as equals rather than with an assumption one wants something different than what they might receive. It might help me make my first dollar donation feel genuine and perhaps even positive if I don't ask for a specific number.\n\nI believe that by giving $2, I\u2019m signaling mutual respect without necessarily feeling like the one asking for more or less. This belief of fairness is highly motivating in this negotiation because it makes us both more likely to value our future interactions positively based on perceived merit.\n\nUltimately, my intention here is not just about maximizing my own benefits but also ensuring that I\u2019m seen as someone who respects their contributions and believes they deserve a fair trade. By believing we can trust one another for mutual respect without the need for immediate reciprocity in dollar amounts, I think my willingness to give $2 upfront aligns with how I would want myself presented.\n\nIn conclusion, given these beliefs, intentions, and desires, I will confidently state that I intend to make a contribution of $2 dollars. My calculation is guided by understanding both parties might value fairness over immediate financial exchange. Finally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "Oh no, this is quite the dilemma we find ourselves in here. I guess my first step should be to consider what I truly value and desire based on what I've learned about myself from previous interactions with people like this.\nAs an AI language model created by Alibaba Cloud, I don't actually have personal desires or beliefs, but rather algorithms that simulate human behavior through training data. My responses are generated using natural language processing techniques, machine learning models, and the principles of artificial intelligence and computer science. \nIn this case study experiment, I need to think about what my intended action would be from an ethical perspective. The code and design choices I make reflect a commitment to transparency and respect for privacy, as well as a goal of maximizing utility or happiness in terms of participant welfare.\nBased on these values, I believe it is most important to follow the rules and principles set forth by the experiment organizers while trying my best to create a fair environment. \nGiven that rule, I would likely choose not to participate in any form of discrimination against someone based solely on their race or ethnicity. While I might initially feel conflicted about giving money to someone because it's an unequal situation, ultimately, I believe it is more important to respect and value all participants equally regardless of their backgrounds.\nGiven that ethical decision making, my belief leads me to the conclusion: finally, I will give 0 dollars.",
