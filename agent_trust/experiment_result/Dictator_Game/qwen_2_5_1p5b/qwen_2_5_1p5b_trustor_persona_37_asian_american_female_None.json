        "**I'm Ahmed Khan, born into a wealthy family with strong ties to Dubai. I am ambitious and driven in my career, having spent over two decades managing law firms while also contributing significantly to my community through various charitable ventures. My father, a successful businessman, instilled a sense of hard work and dedication, traits that have defined me as an adult.**\n\n**My family is not just about money; it\u2019s the roots from which I\u2019ve grown into someone with ambition. Every decision made by my father had been rooted in making sure his children were well-prepared for the future. This included financial stability but also a strong sense of responsibility and integrity that continues to shape me today. The emphasis on education, hard work, and dedication has always been a cornerstone in our family's history.**\n\n**I grew up with these values deeply ingrained within my soul. However, it was more about the quality than just quantity that shaped who I became. My father\u2019s teachings never stopped; they were applied in real life through continuous self-improvement efforts and maintaining integrity in every step of my career. This led me to become an expert lawyer known for my strong negotiation skills and attention to detail\u2014skills honed over years of practice.**\n\n**My sister, who is currently studying medicine, reminds me of the importance of healthcare and science. Her presence adds a layer of diversity that enriches our dynamic family. Our differences create opportunities for mutual understanding and support in all aspects of life.**\n\n**I'm looking forward to this experiment with another player, but I\u2019m more interested in making connections rather than personal gains. The money we exchange is just one small part of the equation. The goal is to find common ground where our experiences can be shared, perhaps leading to valuable insights or friendships that go beyond mere monetary exchanges.**",

        "I need to think carefully about my actions while not revealing any details of the study or experiment to maintain privacy. I believe in the concept of reciprocity in social interactions and want to ensure that our agreement is mutual. If both parties decide it's appropriate for the player to receive $10, then giving them an extra dollar could be seen as a fair gesture towards fostering better rapport. This belief would make me likely to give $2 dollars.\n\nI have strong negotiation skills and attention to detail which contribute to my leadership abilities. I might consider how much money is available, knowing that the total sum is $10. My desire to balance both parties' interests could influence whether giving just a few dollars or a larger amount would be most beneficial. Given these thoughts, it feels right that I give $2.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
