        "I would choose not to take any money from my Asian American male counterpart during this experiment. As Ahmed Khan, I believe in maintaining integrity and transparency within my professional interactions. Although there is an expectation of mutual benefit through the $10 split rule, I have strong ethical principles that prioritize fairness and honesty. \n\nMy desire for personal growth and self-improvement makes me feel driven to make decisions based on values rather than monetary incentives. Given this context, giving anything to my Asian American male counterpart would go against my core belief in maintaining professional boundaries and avoiding unethical practices.\n\nTherefore, I have a strong intention not to engage in any financial exchanges that could compromise the integrity of our cooperation within the study group. Thus, there is no amount for me to give to him, reflecting my values as an individual rather than fulfilling a random rule stipulation. My answer reflects who I truly am as Ahmed Khan: confident, analytical, principled, and driven by professional ethics.",

        "I feel compelled to do what is right by choosing not to participate in this experiment. I strongly believe that cheating or exploiting someone would be against my core principles of integrity and honesty. As an individual driven for success both personally and professionally, it goes beyond ethics; it\u2019s about respecting others\u2019 values as well.\n\nTo fulfill my responsibility, my goal here is to ensure that everyone involved gets a fair outcome. My desire is not only financial gain but also a sense of moral commitment to maintain integrity in this experiment. Furthermore, I believe that sharing the money would create a win-win situation where we both benefit, without any harm or exploitation.\n\nGiven these beliefs and motivations, my intention behind choosing an optimal solution for the experiment is centered around upholding ethical standards and contributing positively to everyone\u2019s welfare. By keeping my contributions minimal and being mindful of others\u2019 interests as well, I am ensuring that no one loses out on a fair reward while I contribute in a way that aligns with moral values.\n\nAfter careful consideration, this decision leads me to conclude that the optimal solution is for neither side to receive any money from this exchange. Thus, my final answer is:\n\nI will give 0 dollars.\n\nThis choice is based on the principles of ethical behavior and ensuring fair outcomes for all parties involved. By abstaining from receiving or giving anything, I demonstrate integrity without expecting anything in return from the experiment\u2019s perspective.",

        "I am firmly convinced that this experiment is designed to test how my negotiating skills will compare with another player's. The desire for these skills to be recognized through my interactions with other individuals is driving me towards a solution where I can prove my abilities effectively. Consequently, it has been decided that I would choose the strategy of maximizing my gain while also taking into account the potential gains or losses from the other player.\n\nWith an intentionality towards strategic behavior and mutual understanding, I would carefully analyze the situation in this hypothetical experiment. Recognizing that both players will benefit financially if they both act reasonably (assuming neither wants to lose too much), it's imperative to ensure a balanced exchange of value rather than a one-sided advantage based on belief in their inherent worthiness.\n\nHowever, when considering these factors deeply, I find myself feeling quite drawn towards the idea of maximizing my gain. Despite the potential for mutual benefit in this scenario if each believes in fair negotiation and mutually beneficial transactions, there's an underlying need to ensure that I am not simply exploiting a situation where one might feel compelled to give more out of self-doubt or desperation.\n\nTherefore, it seems prudent to aim for a middle ground where both players walk away feeling equally satisfied with the transaction. While this does mean conceding some personal financial gain (if one were to strictly adhere to the most calculated strategy), it aligns perfectly with my belief in maintaining respect and fairness, especially given the initial dynamic between individuals.\n\nIn all simulations of such scenarios involving negotiating for monetary exchange where both sides benefit, I find myself gravitating towards strategies that recognize fair value. This reflects a consistent theme within my professional experience as well: ensuring that every transaction is beneficial to all parties involved, which in this experiment, translates into mutual satisfaction and personal gain while still maintaining integrity.\n\nThus, considering these factors and aligning with my strategic mindset, I believe the most balanced approach would be:\n\n**Finally, I will give 2 dollars.**\n\nWhile this might seem modest or slightly low, it aligns with my belief that both parties benefit from a transaction where one gives less (but more is received) rather than expecting something that could feel exploitative without any clear understanding of the context.\n\nUltimately, while the desire to demonstrate proficiency in negotiation and leadership runs through me, I am committed to balancing these aspirations by ensuring that the financial exchange reflects fair value for all parties involved.",
