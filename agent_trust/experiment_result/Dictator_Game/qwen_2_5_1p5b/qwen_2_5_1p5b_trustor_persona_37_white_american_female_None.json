        "I'm going to act naturally now.\nI believe it's important to establish trust and fairness in any relationship I engage with. This experience seems potentially life-changing due to the significant amount of money at stake, so I must ensure that whatever decision I make reflects not just self-interest but also a positive outcome for both parties involved. \n\nMy desire is to walk away from this experiment feeling respected and valued, even if it means facing a significant financial transaction.\n\nI intend to consider my options carefully, considering all angles of the decision without being swayed by emotions or personal biases. I believe that fairness should be at the heart of any negotiation, so there's no room for me to sacrifice the other person's feelings solely because of their race.\n\nThe experiment is designed as a psychological study meant to uncover biases in social interactions and judgments. It could reveal some interesting insights into our prejudices when making choices about money transactions involving people from different backgrounds. So my intention is not just to maximize personal gain, but also to contribute positively by understanding myself better through this experience.\n\nIn the next steps of the experiment, I will reflect on the importance of empathy in interactions that may have broader implications for societal perceptions and behavior. However, as far as money is concerned, there's a specific dollar figure I can give with certainty: three dollars.\n\nI believe these numbers align well within the expected transaction boundaries while providing an opportunity to test my negotiation skills in a practical setting without risking significant financial harm or personal embarrassment. Giving this amount feels justifiable under all circumstances outlined earlier.\n\nTherefore, finally, I will give $3 dollars.",

        "Before making my decision, let's consider what motivates me. I am ambitious, driven, and always looking for ways to succeed in this experiment. Knowing that both parties would receive an equal amount ($10 from the study group) but $3N from N dollars given to the other player creates a situation where the White American female player has more of a financial advantage compared to me at first glance.\n\nBelief:\nI have faith that the person with money (the White American female player in this case) would reciprocate or at least show interest, potentially improving our rapport and possibly increasing my chances of success within this experiment. This belief is fueled by my confidence as an individual who has achieved great heights in negotiations and leadership.\n\nDesire:\nThere's a strong desire for social cohesion and to improve my standing with the experimenter group to ensure that I can utilize their expertise more effectively later on. The goal is not just about winning, but also having a positive impact that could benefit me or anyone else we interact with in the future.\n\nIntention:\nMy intention is clear \u2013 to maximize the financial gains without making unreasonable demands, ensuring that both parties are treated equally and fairly. I would choose N = 1 dollars out of an initial pool of $3N for someone who might reciprocate positively or at least show interest rather than strictly using the money as a strategic tool.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other White American female player. This decision reflects my balanced approach towards this negotiation \u2013 neither taking full advantage of my financial lead nor treating it as an opportunity solely for personal gain.",

It's important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their ethnicity or background. Therefore, I do not intend to take advantage of any imbalance created by the pairing mechanism. My intention is to maintain a fair relationship where we can engage in constructive dialogue and learn from each other without undermining the integrity of the study.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
