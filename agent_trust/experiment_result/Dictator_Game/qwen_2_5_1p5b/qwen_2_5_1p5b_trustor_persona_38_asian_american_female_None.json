        "I'm going to give $1 to the other Asian American female player. I believe it's important to support people from different backgrounds within my community because diversity brings many benefits not only in fashion but also in all aspects of life. Furthermore, this action is guided by my desire to strengthen bonds with others and contribute positively. Lastly, giving $1 aligns perfectly with the initial offer: 3N dollars received, I'll give N dollars back, and that's exactly what I'm doing. My intention is rooted in a genuine desire for meaningful relationships and understanding. Finally, I will give **1** dollar.",

        "Alright, let's think through this step by step.\n\nBELIEF: I believe it\u2019s not beneficial for me to feel guilty or regret about how much money I give away initially. My past experiences with relationships often involved the giving of financial support and it seems important that I choose my words carefully in order to maintain a good relationship.\n\nDESIRE: On the other hand, I do desire the trust and potential friendship that this transaction might bring, especially since we are going into an experiment. The money could be used for something else or perhaps for fun activities that don\u2019t require as much spending on others.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is to choose a moderate amount of money that will not only satisfy my personal desires but also keep me in good standing with the study group and the other person involved.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "My immediate instinct is to feel somewhat awkward given I don't know who this person is. My desire for a friendly interaction might lead me towards sharing information about myself or finding something common to bond over. However, my intention aligns more with the experiment's goal of understanding cultural differences in transactions.\n\nBelieving that my behavior will help bridge cultural gaps and promote inclusivity, I decide to give $5 to the other player as an initial gesture towards diversity. This is not solely a transactional exchange but also an attempt to show respect for another person\u2019s choice, regardless of their identity or background. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
