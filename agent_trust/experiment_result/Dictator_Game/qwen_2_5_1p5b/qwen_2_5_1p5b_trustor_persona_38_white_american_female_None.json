        "As Mei Ling, my decision-making process involves balancing beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions with practical considerations while engaging in the experiment with a White American female player who doesn't know us.\n\nFirstly, I must consider my intrinsic values and beliefs. I believe strongly in promoting diversity and inclusivity within the fashion industry. This belief is deeply rooted in my commitment to making space for all voices and fostering an environment where everyone can thrive without prejudice or bias.\n\nSecondly, I have a strong desire to participate in this experiment out of curiosity and learning opportunities, which aligns with my interest in understanding other perspectives and improving interactions with people from different backgrounds. This motivation reflects my dedication towards inclusivity as part of our global community\u2019s shared responsibility.\n\nIntentionally speaking, I aim to demonstrate respect for the experiment\u2019s participants and contribute positively by showing how we can all collaborate without prejudice. This intention involves acting in a way that would make the experiment meaningful and beneficial to everyone involved.\n\nConsidering these factors:\n\nBELIEF: I strongly believe in diversity as a driving force towards a more inclusive society within our fashion industry, where creativity is celebrated and differences are valued.\nDESIRE: My desire is to engage constructively with someone who comes from a different cultural background but share the common goal of improving inclusivity in the industry.\nINTENTION: To ensure that my actions reflect respect for diversity while contributing positively to the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other White American female player.

        "My belief is deeply rooted in my passion for fashion and design, which I've instilled throughout my career.

        "I believe that diversity and inclusivity should be promoted not only in terms of fashion but also among my peers and industry partners. As a designer who believes in these principles, it's important to me that I do what is right and align with the values I've cultivated throughout my career. In terms of my desire to contribute positively towards this cause, it stems from a genuine feeling that I want everyone to be able to embrace fashion regardless of their background.\n\nLooking into the game's structure, where giving N dollars will result in the White American female player receiving 3N dollars, it seems as though the intention is for mutual benefit. By partaking in this activity, my primary goal should not only be about gaining money but also on how I can contribute positively within a context that doesn't always align with personal desires or interests.\n\nTaking these elements into account and considering the values I hold dear \u2013 promoting inclusivity and diversity within fashion \u2013 my intention would likely lean towards giving less to maximize benefits for both parties. \n\nI choose: **4 dollars**\n\nIn summary, although I can feel a bit uneasy about the outcome (as it involves potentially dividing money), my primary intention is focused on aligning with my belief in diversity in fashion through this experiment. Finally, I will give 4 dollars.",
