        "I believe it would be prudent not to contribute any money since I don't want to exploit or take advantage of my partner's situation. My desire is to maintain a fair and respectful relationship, even with someone who may have less financial resources. \n\nIn terms of intention, I am committed to preserving our partnership based on mutual respect and equality. I would give $1 dollars if the experiment specifically asks me for that amount, but given the context, there's no real reason to contribute money or affect the balance in a way that could be seen as exploitative. Ultimately, my decision is guided by the desire not to do anything that might harm our partnership.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "As Mei Ling, fashion designer turned researcher of social dynamics, I must first acknowledge my values deeply ingrained in me: inclusivity, creativity, and independent thinking. In this experiment, paired with an unknown White American male player, my main motivation is to demonstrate the influence that belief (the way we perceive ourselves) can have on our actions.\n\nI believe it's essential for individuals like myself to assert our differences within diverse societies while celebrating them. However, I also understand and empathize with people from other backgrounds who might feel challenged by situations where their beliefs about others are not understood or acknowledged.\n\nDesiring the best outcome in this experiment doesn't mean I'll aim purely for financial gain but rather a balanced and respectful interaction that respects both our individual differences and allows us to learn from one another. As such, my intention is not just to secure $10 but to initiate meaningful conversation and foster a sense of understanding and connection.\n\nI will give 5 dollars to the other White American male player. I am confident this amount reflects respect for his background and belief in himself without compromising my personal value system or desire to be seen as financially stable or successful. This act of giving also sets an example that values inclusivity, reflecting on how much we can share and help others even when money exchanges hands.\n\nThus, ending with my intention, I will give **5 dollars**.",

        "Belief: As a fashion designer with a keen eye for trend and a strong sense of style, I believe in my ability to navigate through the competitive world of fashion design effectively.\n\nDesire: I deeply desire to make meaningful connections in this experiment by offering help or support to someone from another cultural background. With my family's history in the fashion industry, I am eager to see how other industries and cultures can influence diversity within our society.\n\nIntention: My intention is to not only gain $10 but also show empathy towards differences among people with a clear belief that everyone deserves respect and inclusion.\n\nGiven this situation, as Mei Ling who has lived for over 35 years in Japan (Tokyo), I feel an inclination to give N dollars where N is at least three. This is because the White American male player could be someone whose background or mannerisms are quite different from mine, and offering some financial support might not only show my respect but also potentially bridge the communication gap.\n\nFinal thought: However, considering that I believe in promoting inclusivity through fashion, a gesture of $15 (which would result in receiving $45 for myself while giving 75 dollars to him) seems more aligned with my intention. This gives me a positive influence on promoting diversity and shows respect from both ends. Thus, the amount given to the White American male player should be $15.\n\nFinal answer: I will give 15 dollars.",
