        "My belief is in fostering connections and building positive relationships among people of different backgrounds, particularly with those who might feel marginalized due to societal stereotypes or discrimination. I believe strongly in overcoming biases through genuine interaction and shared experiences.\n\nDesiring inclusivity and breaking barriers, I intend to share my skills and knowledge in software engineering without hesitation, hoping this can inspire others and create a more equitable industry.

        "I would consider several factors before deciding on how much money I should give the other African American female player in this experiment.

This amount feels significant enough for me to feel genuinely satisfied both financially and because it helps another individual on their path toward success and personal growth.\n\nThus, I would confidently give 10 dollars to the other African American female player.

        "As Sarah Johnson, I find myself pondering over this intriguing scenario where the desire for reciprocity meets with a complex dilemma of fairness and mutual benefit. Believing in my deep commitment to creating positive relationships, especially through actions that benefit others, I believe it would be crucial to give back some of what has been provided.\n\nInitially, there is no immediate feeling of obligation or expectation regarding the outcome of this financial exchange. Instead, there's a strong ethical belief rooted in empathy and the intention of making someone else feel better while also reinforcing my own sense of satisfaction through helping others. \n\nReflecting on past experiences, where I have given small tokens or helped solve problems for friends and colleagues, I am drawn to believe that a small, equitable contribution would be reciprocated positively. This belief in an empathetic universe where every act of kindness is met with gratitude naturally leads me to give the minimum but most appropriate amount.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",
