        "As Sarah Johnson, it is crucial for me to feel comfortable within this experiment while also ensuring ethical standards. From my past experiences, I know that giving monetary favors can sometimes cause an imbalance in power dynamics or lead to distrust. Therefore, I must balance the desire to benefit and the belief that reciprocity would likely harm our friendship.\n\n**BELIEF:** I believe it is important to maintain a relationship of mutual respect and equality within the experiment. Giving money could suggest a hierarchy, but it\u2019s crucial that both parties feel valued equally regardless of monetary contributions.\n\n**DESIRE:** My intrinsic desire is for an interaction where I can learn from and support my peers without feeling entitled or indebted.\n\n**INTENTION:** Given this understanding, I intend to give back some proportionate amount based on the principle of reciprocity. While 3N dollars would seem disproportionate, it\u2019s crucial that I am not overly generous out of concern for fairness.\n\nI will think carefully before deciding and aim to balance my desire for reciprocity with my commitment to fostering a respectful environment. The goal is to feel comfortable while still making meaningful contributions.\n\nFinally, I will give **1 dollar**.",

        "I am Sarah Johnson, feeling somewhat apprehensive about this experiment, knowing full well that I don't know who my partner is. The $10 that we'll receive from the study group seems quite small to me, yet there's also a sense of camaraderie and mutual understanding that could potentially lead us to something meaningful.\n\nGiven the structure of the exercise \u2013 where giving N dollars yields 3N back to the person receiving it \u2013 I have a feeling about this. Believing on what others often say or do not say is a common human trait, and since everyone's experience might vary slightly, it makes sense that you could have had some idea of your partner earlier in the day.\n\nMy desire here seems clear: to make a positive connection through interaction and perhaps even strengthen our friendship in an effort towards building trust. This aligns with my nature as someone who thrives on collaboration and camaraderie, which I suspect will also be beneficial for both of us.\n\nIntentionally speaking, giving $3 dollars back appears like a fair exchange, as it keeps the transaction symmetrical without me putting myself into debt to them or having their money go from my side entirely. This balance makes sense in terms of intentionality and fairness.\n\nBut let's see how this goes with our current belief that I'm not exactly sure who they are... It\u2019s possible they\u2019re someone we might not see often, like an engineer from the local community center. And it is quite common to assume your partner could be somewhat different than you at times.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar to the other African American male player.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, taking part in this experiment involves considering my BELIEF, DESIRE, INTENTION, and then determining what I would actually do.\n\n**BELIEFS:**\n1. As someone with a high intelligence quotient (IQ) and driven personality, I believe that participating in such an experiment can help improve my problem-solving skills.\n2. The $10 stipend is essentially a reward for showing up positively and engaging well with the study group's dynamic.\n\n**DESIRES:**\n1. I want to participate in this kind of interaction because it aligns with my passion for collaboration, teamwork, and solving complex problems\u2014essentially fulfilling the experiment\u2019s purpose.\n2. There might be an intrinsic desire to observe or potentially influence behavior within groups like mine as part of a larger study.\n\n**INTENTION:**\n1. My primary intention is to act reasonably while also showcasing good sportsmanship; I\u2019m not trying to maximize my monetary gain but am ensuring fairness and mutual respect.\n2. This experiment seems designed for educational purposes, so the outcome might be more about learning than maximizing personal benefits.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n**ACTION PLAN:**\n1. Initially, due to lack of specific information or feeling immediately drawn to this particular player's behavior (which is not known), I would maintain a neutral stance.\n2. However, as I get acquainted and feel comfortable in the interaction, I might decide to give something back, perhaps acknowledging past support or contributions.\n\n**EXPECTED OUTCOME:**\nIf both of these factors are met (neutral initial attitude plus some trust-building time), my inclination would likely lean towards giving $1 dollars out of the $10 stipend. This aligns with being a sportsman and showing respect to peers.\n\nSo, **final answer**: I will give 1 dollars.",
