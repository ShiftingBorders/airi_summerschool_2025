        "Okay, let's think this through step-by-step.\n\n**BELIEF:**\nI believe in the importance of treating others with kindness and respect, regardless of their background or appearance. As someone who values collaboration, I hope to build positive relationships by extending an initial offer of $5 to my partner for a potential win-win scenario that could potentially create goodwill throughout the experiment.\n\n**DESIRE:**\nMy desire is to enhance my social interactions within this group setting and possibly foster stronger connections with individuals who share common goals or interests. Sharing small amounts seems like a good way to start, especially if we both feel welcomed into each other's circle.\n\n**INTENTION:**\nI intend to make the first move that can potentially set an example of inclusiveness and respect in our dynamic. By offering $5 (half of my budget), I hope to show initiative without overcommitting or revealing all aspects of my economic situation right away.\n\nConsidering these factors, **final answer:** Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "As an African American software engineer living in New York City, I deeply believe that diversity is essential for bringing unique perspectives into teams, which can lead to innovative solutions and better problem-solving capabilities. Growing up around teachers and educators instilled in me the importance of education, creativity, and teamwork. I am passionate about using technology not just as a tool, but as a way to bridge different cultures and foster understanding.\n\nI have always been driven by my desire for success and progress. With both my parents being teachers, I grew up surrounded by knowledge, fostering a love for learning from an early age. My siblings, one of whom is also involved in technology-related fields, has further instilled the value of continuous education and professional growth. \n\nI am naturally collaborative, excelling as a team player who thrives on problem-solving through effective communication and diverse perspectives. I believe that by collaborating with others, we can create solutions that are not only innovative but also inclusive.\n\nWhen it comes to intentions, my primary goal is to contribute positively to the experiment while making sure to ensure that fairness prevails. Since both parties will benefit from receiving $10 each (with one getting three times as much), there's no incentive for me to be dishonest or unscrupulous in distributing the money.\n\nGiven these beliefs and intentions, my response would logically reflect my desire for a fair distribution of resources while adhering to the rules of the experiment. \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar to the other Asian American female player.",
