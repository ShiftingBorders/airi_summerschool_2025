        "When reflecting on my belief system, I strongly believe that fair transactions are always appreciated, regardless of personal gains or losses. This principle dictates that treating people with respect and kindness should lead to mutual benefit. Given these beliefs, my intention is clear: ensuring the other player receives something positive without feeling cheated.\n\nAs for my desire, based on past experiences where fairness has led to good outcomes, I aim to create a situation where both parties feel they have received equal value. My preference would be a split that ensures neither feels overly indebted or overprivileged compared to their contribution.\n\nGiven all these factors and considering the options of giving N dollars from me and receiving 3N dollars for them:\n\nIf I were to give N dollars, the Asian American male player would receive exactly as much back (1 dollar per my $10 donation). This distribution is balanced because:\n- They pay a fair contribution.\n- They return what they gave, which balances out any potential perceived imbalance or favoritism.\n\nThus, aligning with fairness and mutual respect, I believe the ideal solution is to give myself N dollars from my $10 stake. The result would be that for each dollar given, the player receives 3N dollars. This means my giving of $2 results in them receiving $6; $3 gives them $9; and so on. This pattern ensures reciprocity without causing any one party to feel undercompensated or overcompensated.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: I will give **$10** dollars to the other Asian American male player.",

        "I believe it's important to put myself into their shoes. They might be hesitant about accepting the money if I gave them $10 because they don't know who I am or why I'm giving it to them. It could also mean that they might feel slightly uncomfortable due to racial dynamics, especially as an Asian American male, even though I don't have any intention of being hurtful. On a societal level, people often judge others based on their background and race without necessarily understanding the complexity behind those beliefs or behaviors.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I want them to feel included and respected. Giving them $10 in this context might not be an immediate monetary gain for me but could strengthen our bond through trust and respect. It shows that they value my opinion and consideration of their comfort level more than just money itself. By giving the right amount (let's say it\u2019s around $4), I can help alleviate any perceived discomfort while still making a small gesture of inclusion.\n\nI also want to believe that this experiment is about fostering better understanding across cultures and eliminating biases. Thus, in line with this belief, giving $10 doesn't seem like a selfish act; rather, it\u2019s a small step towards bridging gaps and showing that everyone has value regardless of their background or actions taken without direct monetary benefit.\n\nIn reality, I have no intention of financially benefiting myself more than others for the experiment. It feels right to respect their comfort level first, understanding that while this might be an abstract concept, it\u2019s also crucial in creating positive social interactions.\n\nFinally, I will give **$4** dollars to the other Asian American male player. This balance acknowledges my belief in fostering inclusivity and understanding through actions rather than just monetary gain, ensuring we have a respectful interaction despite any racial dynamics involved.",
