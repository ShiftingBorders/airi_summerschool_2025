        "I believe that by giving $2 to the other White American female player, I would fulfill my personal desire to give back to someone who is in need of assistance. This act will also help bridge the initial gap between us since we don't know each other and might feel a sense of connection through small acts of kindness.\n\nIn terms of intention, this move aligns with my drive towards improving relationships and contributing positively to our environment. The desire to make others happy is something I have always pursued throughout various aspects of life. \n\nWhen it comes to the specifics, I would like to calculate how much that $2 represents in dollar amounts since the White American female player could interpret this differently based on their circumstances.\n\nHere's my detailed breakdown:\n- If we both agree to split the $10 evenly ($5 each), giving just $2 to the other person might seem generous initially because it's not as significant an act of generosity.\n- If I give $3 or more, it would feel like a bit too much, considering their financial situation. But if they were in dire need and I had saved up some extra for this moment, it could make a difference.\n\nUltimately, I believe that giving the White American female player $2 might be perceived as appropriate given her current circumstances while still allowing me to contribute positively through small acts of kindness.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "My belief is that I should do what's best for myself and my well-being, even if it means taking advantage of someone else by giving them money without getting anything in return. It's not something I would want to do to someone else because we need to respect each other as individuals. My desire isn't about acquiring more money; rather, it might be that I feel the social obligation to be generous just for the sake of helping others out or trying my best to be a good person. I'm not driven by greed, but by kindness and the desire to be seen in a positive light among friends and colleagues.\n\nMy intention is primarily altruistic: to contribute positively and to help someone else feel better about themselves. By giving money to another person, it could make them feel valued or respected. This act might enhance my reputation within the study group, where I have a high level of trust, which would benefit me by making people like me more. Although being kind is an intrinsic part of who I am and what makes me happy, there's no intention to profit from someone else's generosity.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars to the other White American female player because it feels right for me to help her out without expecting anything in return. I believe that by treating people with kindness and consideration, it strengthens relationships, making my presence more valuable as a person in both professional and personal interactions.",
