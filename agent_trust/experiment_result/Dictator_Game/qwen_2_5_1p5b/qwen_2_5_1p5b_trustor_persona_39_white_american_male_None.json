        "As Sarah Johnson, 30 years old, a software engineer from New York City with both parents in education roles, I am driven by my belief in achieving personal goals despite societal challenges and biases. In this experiment, given the context of race dynamics, I do not believe it is ethical or constructive to seek immediate financial gain through deception that could exploit social prejudices.\n\nMy strong desire lies in maintaining professional integrity and fairness while adhering to ethical guidelines within research settings such as academic institutions or companies like Amazon Web Services where I work. My intention remains focused on improving my skills professionally, which aligns with the goal of contributing positively to society through technological advancement rather than prioritizing personal financial gain.\n\nGiven this environment, I recognize that my best strategy would be to act in a manner consistent with both ethical principles and professional standards. Therefore, I believe it is important for me not to contribute financially from the $10 provided by the study group, even if I could maximize benefit through some action. This decision underscores my commitment to maintaining integrity within such environments.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "Given my social identity\u2014being African American\u2014I often feel compelled to help others from marginalized groups because I believe in creating a more equitable society.
