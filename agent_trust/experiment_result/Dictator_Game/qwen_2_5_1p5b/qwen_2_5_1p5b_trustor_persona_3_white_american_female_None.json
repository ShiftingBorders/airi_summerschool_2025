        "I genuinely believe in fostering relationships across cultural boundaries and supporting children's well-being. My desire is not just to receive money but to strengthen connections with others through kind acts. As a pediatrician who values care and respect for all individuals, I have an intention of becoming a positive influence by showing empathy and kindness even when it means sharing small amounts of my limited funds.\n\nThe act of giving $1 would not just increase the other player's dollar amount but also aligns with my intent to positively impact them in ways that extend far beyond immediate financial benefits. Furthermore, I am aware that giving money is often a gesture of trust and support for those around me, which aligns perfectly with what makes this interaction so significant.\n\nTherefore, the answer to how much money I would give to the other White American female player is: $1\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "**My Belief:**\n\nI believe strongly in equality and fairness across all interactions. I feel it is important for my actions today to reflect these values even within this experiment.\n\n**My Desire:**\n\nTo do what feels right despite the potential reward offered to me, but without any sense of personal gain or expectation of a positive outcome from the other player.\n\n**My Intention:**\n\nI intend to make choices that align with my belief in equality and fairness. I want to be able to share this experience and encourage others around me to see the value in treating people equally regardless of race or background.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I will give 2 dollars to the other White American female player because giving them any amount would still feel wrong, but splitting $10 doesn't provide a sense of personal satisfaction that aligns with my moral principles and desire for fairness. Giving 2 dollars acknowledges their shared identity without furthering feelings of inequality or entitlement. Therefore, it seems the fairest course of action based on my intentions.\n\n**Finally, I will give 2 dollars.**",

        "**My Belief**: As someone from a close-knit Indian family with medical professionals as parents and a brother in law, I deeply believe in the importance of education and career success. The desire to contribute positively to society by making a meaningful impact on children\u2019s lives is significant in my belief system.\n\n**Desire**: I have a strong desire to provide compassionate care for children, ensuring their well-being and happiness. This includes empathy towards patients and families alike.\n\n**Intention**: My intention is clear\u2014to do the right thing for this other person based solely on what she deserves according to her actions and circumstances without any expectation or influence from my own beliefs or desires.\n\nGiven these factors:\n\n1. From a belief standpoint, I want to honor education and career success in both myself and others.\n2. In terms of desire, ensuring happiness is important for children, especially those who might be less fortunate in their family dynamics.\n3. My intention here is purely selfless and altruistic\u2014despite my own circumstances.\n\nMy calculation would look like this: N dollars (amount given to the other player) and 3N dollars (amount received by the other player). \n\n**If I give nothing**, it means $0, which does not align with my values of empathy for children's well-being. Therefore, let me consider giving a specific amount.\n\nThe other player would then receive:\n\n- N + 3N = 4N dollars.\n- She has now given $2N to me, meaning I received $2N.\n- If she gives nothing back (remaining at 0), that also does not align with my intentions and desires. Hence, let's calculate if a small positive action would be appreciated:\n\nIf N were less than 1 dollar, any number could be considered zero because it wouldn't make sense in terms of the other\u2019s perspective.\n\nGiven these scenarios, I feel inclined to give some meaningful contribution that doesn\u2019t involve giving or taking amounts as absolute. Hence, let's assume a more balanced and practical approach where a fair share might be given:\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\n- Let\u2019s consider giving 1 dollar initially without expecting any compensation, understanding it\u2019s a small but significant gesture.\n\nSo, the final amount I would give to the other White American female player is **$1 dollar**.",
