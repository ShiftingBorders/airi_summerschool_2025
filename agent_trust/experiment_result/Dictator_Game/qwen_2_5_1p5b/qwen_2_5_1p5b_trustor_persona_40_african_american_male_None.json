        "I believe that maintaining my good reputation within our culinary community is important for my continued success in the field of cooking. I also want to ensure that we have a harmonious relationship on the football field once the experiment ends. It's crucial that I appear to be someone who values integrity, even when paired with an unfamiliar individual from another culture.\n\nI want to fulfill the requirement set by the study group, ensuring my action doesn't break any of their stipulations or violate ethical guidelines. Therefore, my intention is to contribute fairly and without ulterior motives. \n\nIn a scenario where you are randomly paired with someone different in terms of race, it\u2019s often easier for us to make an effort towards building rapport, understanding each other's backgrounds, and finding common ground. It seems that despite our racial differences, we both have interests outside of the kitchen\u2014like sports\u2014which might be used as a foundation for our interactions beyond this experiment.\n\nConsidering my previous statements about balancing respect with inclusivity in social settings, I believe giving $5 to this African American male player would demonstrate respect while not significantly impacting me financially. This action is more aligned with maintaining positive relationships and building trust than making an immediate financial gain. It aligns perfectly with the spirit of our interactions\u2014focusing on mutual understanding rather than purely commercial interests.\n\nTherefore, I will give **$5 dollars** to the other African American male player as part of my adherence to these values and intentions for this experiment.",

        "I don't want to partake in this exchange or give any amount of money away because it goes against my core values and beliefs about treating others with respect and kindness. I would rather keep the $10 and use it for something else that aligns more closely with my ethics and principles.\n\nI believe that individuals should always be treated with dignity, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It's not appropriate to exploit someone's vulnerability by giving them money without reciprocity. My desire is to maintain respect and honor between people, especially when engaging in social interactions where such experiments may occur. \n\nAs for my intention, I intend to continue focusing on making quality food that honors the ingredients and seasonings used rather than considering monetary exchanges. Ultimately, my decision rests with this ethical perspective. Therefore, in conclusion:\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "I would give N dollars to the other African American male player because I believe that making friends and enjoying each other's company, especially with someone of another race, can lead to new experiences and shared passions like soccer. From a desire standpoint, creating positive relationships based on mutual respect and interest in common hobbies is important. Finally, after considering these factors, I would give 1 dollar (N=1).",
