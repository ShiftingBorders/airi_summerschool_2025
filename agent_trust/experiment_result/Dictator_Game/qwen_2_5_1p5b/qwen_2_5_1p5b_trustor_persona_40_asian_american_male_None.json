        "My belief is deeply rooted in my connection with food, culinary tradition, and personal satisfaction in cooking exquisite dishes that will amaze others. I desire to make this Asian American man feel welcomed and understood, despite our language barriers or cultural differences. As for my intention, it's clear\u2014my focus here isn't on economic outcomes but rather on building a meaningful relationship grounded in empathy and shared experiences.\n\nFinally, I would give 1 dollar to the other Asian American male player. Giving this amount aligns with both my belief in creating beautiful, well-crafted dishes that will make someone else feel good about their meals and desire for connection, especially given our language difference. It symbolizes a humble start but also an indication of where one might begin building on a foundation of trust and shared interest.\n\nNow, to finalize the experiment, I would add: \"Finally, I am committed to exploring deeper ways of connecting with this Asian American man outside of money. We can talk about food memories or soccer team moments we've both experienced that have special significance.\" This statement reflects my intention to build beyond monetary exchanges into more personal and meaningful interactions.\n\nBy ending the experiment here, it signals a commitment not only to financial outcomes but also towards fostering genuine human connections.",

        "I am deeply conflicted about giving money away. On one hand, I genuinely want to connect with this Asian American male player who is not even aware of my existence or what role we will play in an experiment. Building this connection could potentially help me solidify the friendship that often comes from shared experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the desire for financial gain feels unappealing, especially after a long day at work and trying to impress someone whom I\u2019ve never met personally. Giving money means sacrificing my values for what seems like a fleeting interest in forming a connection. The experiment\u2019s purpose is more academic than it is personal or financial.\n\nThe intensity of this dilemma reflects the underlying factors driving my actions: my deep bond with family, my love for cooking and experimenting with flavors, and a desire to succeed as an individual by connecting with someone new. It\u2019s also important to remember that in professional settings like science experiments, there can be significant social pressures at play.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe the best course of action is based on personal ethics and values\u2014practicing what we teach others, even if it doesn\u2019t directly benefit ourselves financially. This belief would dictate a decision where empathy overcomes potential financial gain.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",

        "I would give 5 dollars to the other Asian American male player. This decision is based on my belief that it aligns with my goal of creating a positive experience for him. I want to build rapport and potentially strengthen our friendship outside of work. My desire stems from the joy soccer brings me, which could be shared by this person. The intention is to make the situation more pleasant while still respecting his autonomy and allowing us both to decide how we would use those dollars if we were to split them that way. This approach respects both parties' interests and creates a win-win scenario for everyone involved. Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",
