        "My answer is based on my personal values of empathy and fairness. I firmly believe that everyone deserves respect regardless of their race or ethnicity. From a moral standpoint, I want to make sure that the other player feels valued for his contribution to this experiment. Therefore, despite the $10 stipend provided by the study group, which aligns with the game's objective, my primary desire is to contribute money in such a way that reflects fairness and respect.\n\nIntentionally considering all these factors, I would give the White American male player **$5**. This choice acknowledges the possibility of financial support while also showing empathy towards him for his role as another participant in this experiment. The $5 amount does not deviate from my personal belief that everyone should feel valued and appreciated, even in an experimental context.\n\nFinally, I will give **$5**.",

        "I would carefully consider my motivations before deciding how much money I should give to the other White American male player. Based on past experiments and studies, it's clear that individuals often show more generosity when they believe their actions will be witnessed or rewarded by others, which aligns with social norms of reciprocity and conformity.\n\nGiven this context, I would probably base my decision partly on whether I genuinely want to please the other participant or if I am doing it out of a sense of obligation. However, as a chef who values authenticity in relationships, I might also be inclined towards honesty because giving false generosity could potentially harm our relationship's trust and integrity.\n\nIn weighing all these factors, I think my core belief is that genuine connections should not be compromised for social norms or desires for reciprocity to flourish naturally. While the desire for others' approval could lead me to give some money out of politeness, my intention would likely be based on deeper understanding and respect rather than just giving in expectation.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I might decide that a small amount is more appropriate to maintain an honest relationship without overcompensating for social expectations. Therefore, my final decision will not go beyond $1.\n\nFinally, I will give **$0** dollars.",

        "I'm going to make this choice based on my internal compass of what feels right for myself, not just out of obligation or calculation for dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar. The ethical values I cherish in the kitchen guide me to feel this way. In the family tradition passed down from generations, there's a code about giving generously that I've been taught. It\u2019s more important for me to make sure our relationship is based on mutual respect and appreciation rather than any material gain. That said, it would be difficult to say how much less money someone else could potentially have compared to me in such an experiment, so 1 dollar seems a fair middle ground. I believe this balance will lead us closer to understanding each other better while maintaining true character connections based on values and respect rather than material exchanges.\n\nGiving $1 doesn't mean anything is lacking; it\u2019s simply putting my emphasis back on the emotional and personal connection, which is of great importance for me.",
