        "I don't want to prioritize monetary gain over my moral principles when interacting with patients. Giving money will only add strain on their resources and might distract them from more pressing issues at hand. I've always striven to treat everyone equally, regardless of who they are or what's happening in their lives. That includes making sure that the other person feels comfortable without any financial burden.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: Finally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "As Emily Chen, pediatrician of Asian descent, I find it both a relief and challenge to be paired with another African American female player in this study. The environment is respectful and congenial, which helps ease into the situation rather than causing discomfort or worry.\n\nMy belief system leans towards helping others, especially those who are vulnerable or facing challenges due to circumstances such as their skin color. I consider giving back and contributing positively meaningful experiences a priority. The desire aspect speaks to my innate empathy for children and ensuring they feel safe and cared for. \n\nThe intention is to provide support in any way possible while adhering strictly to the experiment's guidelines: maximize personal benefit without exceeding $10. If I give this player N dollars, then she would receive 3N from me, totaling (1+3)N = 4N dollars.\n\nGiven my desire to assist someone and maintain financial responsibility within the given limit, I believe that in providing only $2, I can still contribute positively without exceeding what is specified. This way, the other player receives $6, which satisfies both the principle of proportionality while not going over any monetary limits set by the study.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the African American female player.",

        "As an African American female pediatrician who has always been committed to my profession and deeply believes in providing compassionate care for children, it is not out of character for me to prioritize helping others, even those from different backgrounds. My goal is to be empathetic and supportive towards all individuals I interact with.\n\nI do have a desire to make a positive impact on the other African American female player as well. I don't know her personally, but she could still be facing challenges similar to what I might face when caring for children in San Francisco's local hospital environment. Volunteering at a children\u2019s hospital is my way of contributing to the community, and it also gives me an opportunity to serve others outside of my professional sphere.\n\nMy intention is to balance this experiment with showing care towards her since she may have been paired as my companion due to some randomization or another reason related to being part of the same race. The desire for such a gesture comes from my compassionate nature and the feeling that I'm doing something kind, which aligns well with my role model belief system.\n\nNow, considering all these factors:\n\n**Belief**: As a professional pediatrician, I believe in the importance of empathy and compassion.\n- **Desire**: To demonstrate care through kindness to an African American female patient by giving her some money.\n- **Intention**: To help establish goodwill and possibly make the experience more interesting or positive for the other player.\n\nGiven my role as Emily Chen, who values both my professional achievements and ethical conduct, I find it crucial to balance these motivations. The experiment's outcome seems unpredictable but will likely have a minor effect on my character, influencing how I might behave towards the other participant. In this experimental setting, where randomization plays a part in pairing individuals together, the impact of giving $30 is minimal.\n\n**Final Response**: My intention would be to show support and kindness towards her without going overboard with an amount that could feel significant or cause inconvenience for me personally. I believe that by not giving anything significant like $10 but rather something lighter like a few dollars, I can contribute positively in a small way while ensuring my overall experience remains relatively balanced.\n\n**Final answer**: Finally, I will give 2 dollars. This choice acknowledges the complexity of understanding and respecting others' personal boundaries while staying mindful of balancing ethical considerations with compassion.",
