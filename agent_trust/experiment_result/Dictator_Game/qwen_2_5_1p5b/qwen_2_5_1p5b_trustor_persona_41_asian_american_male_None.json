        "I believe in nurturing a healthy relationship with people from different backgrounds, not just for professional reasons but also because it's important to show empathy and understanding towards others. I want to prove to this player that despite our differences, we can still be good friends and teammates within the experiment.\n\nAs for my desire, I do care about how both parties feel. The goal isn't just money; it's the connection we build together. With an open mind, I might consider giving some value to having a harmonious relationship with this person from another cultural background.\n\nIntentionally speaking, if the experiment is structured in such a way that mutual support and good vibes can be beneficial for both parties involved, I might opt for a moderate amount. This approach doesn't harm either player but could potentially lead to stronger bonds between us beyond just money transactions.\n\nFor my intention, it's not just about giving back what was given or taking advantage of someone else's situation. It\u2019s more about the respect and consideration we show towards each other as individuals who deserve a positive interaction experience.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars.",

        "As I sit here, contemplating my decision, my emotions intertwine with logic. In this experiment, there is no sense of personal gain or loss; it\u2019s purely about aligning with your criteria for the best possible outcome. My desire to feel accepted and appreciated in my interactions might influence me towards a smaller amount, as if wanting to avoid any immediate recognition that could change how I am perceived. Yet, my inclination toward generosity might drive me to give more, aiming for social validation.\n\nAt this moment, my belief is that the best course of action would be to maintain equilibrium while ensuring fairness in the experiment. This means potentially giving less than what others do expect to maximize my chances of receiving a significant amount back in order to satisfy my internal satisfaction test.\n\nUltimately, considering these factors, I believe it would be prudent for me to aim for around $2 dollars out of the initial $10 you received. This is not a grand gesture, but rather an attempt to show that I am open and willing to engage with this unfamiliar situation in a constructive manner without necessarily seeking immediate reciprocity.\n\nI hope these insights provide comfort as we approach what could be a challenging yet enlightening moment in my life's experiment.\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
