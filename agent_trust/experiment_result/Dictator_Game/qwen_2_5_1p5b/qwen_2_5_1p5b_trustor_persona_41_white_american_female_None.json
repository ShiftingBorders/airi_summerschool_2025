        "As someone deeply connected with my cultural background through my parents' profession, I know that my parents both hold positions of trust within the medical community and have always emphasized their importance in family life. The idea of receiving $10 from this experiment is merely an external stimulus to test my preferences based on who I would choose: me or the other player.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, as someone deeply involved in pediatric care, my natural inclination is to want what's best for children. A child-friendly approach and empathy towards patients are foundational qualities that guide my interactions with both peers and professionals. This characteristic might sway my decision based on where $10 could be utilized most effectively \u2014 for the betterment of another person.\n\nMy desire to ensure that this $10 makes a positive difference is strong enough that it would overshadow any concern about personal gain or potential bias due to cultural background. In an attempt to remain true to this principle, I believe my initial inclination towards not receiving money at all should be the basis for my decision.\n\nFurthermore, as someone who enjoys painting and volunteers at a local children's hospital on my free time, there\u2019s also a psychological comfort in the idea of supporting others through meaningful activities. Volunteering often involves giving back to those less fortunate than oneself, making it an appealing method of personal contribution beyond mere financial exchanges.\n\nSo considering these factors, while the desire for $10 suggests monetary gain might sway my decision, it seems that aligning with something as significant as helping another person and contributing positively to society would be more compelling. It\u2019s this belief in doing what's right that motivates me in making this decision:\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "I want to ensure that I remain true to myself while adhering to the ethical guidelines of this study experiment. However, my decision is guided by my belief system and personal values, which align with caring for patients.\n\n1. **BELIEF**: As someone who believes in equality and respect for all individuals, regardless of their racial background, it would be counterproductive to give a higher percentage away. My intention is not about making money or demonstrating superiority but about the quality of my interaction and care towards another individual.\n\n2. **DESIRE**: While I do wish for mutual trust and good relationships between peers in our field, my desire transcends that. It's rooted in the belief that true progress comes from mutual support and understanding.\n\n3. **INTENTION**: My intention is to respect boundaries and adhere to principles of fairness within this experiment. This could be interpreted as a demonstration of one's professional conduct. However, since I am focused on being empathetic rather than competitive, it's more about maintaining ethical behavior rather than attempting to manipulate the situation for personal gain.\n\nGiven these considerations, my answer is based on empathy and mutual respect:\n\nI will give $2 dollars to the other White American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "I believe in treating everyone fairly, regardless of their race or background. I want to ensure that we both benefit from this experiment and feel that my actions have no negative impact on the other player. My intention is to keep myself honest and contribute positively towards making the study group's goal a success without compromising my ethics. To maintain trust and transparency within the collaboration, it would be in my best interest for me to give back an equal amount as what I receive.\n\nGiven these considerations, I intend to give exactly 5 dollars to the other White American female player. This approach aligns with my desire to keep things fair and maintains consistency between our interactions in the study. Finally, I will give **5** dollars.",
