        "Given my role as Emily Chen, a pediatrician of Asian descent, I believe it is important to base my actions not just on financial considerations but also on respect for others' preferences and well-being. As someone who values empathy and understanding, I want this interaction to be positive and conducive to mutual trust.\n\nIn the context of the experiment where I am randomly paired with another White American male player, I find it significant that we have different backgrounds and perspectives. It\u2019s crucial to treat this encounter with kindness and consideration for how these differences could impact our conversation. My desire is to make sure both parties feel respected and understood throughout the interaction.\n\nMy intention is to act in a way that aligns with my belief system, focusing on mutual respect, understanding, and positivity rather than exploiting my financial position or trying to impose any bias towards one party over another. This approach would ensure a respectful dialogue where I give an appropriate amount of money without being influenced by any personal gain.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, my decision is to give 3 dollars (3N) to the other White American male player. My reasoning is that this act aligns with treating others kindly and understanding their position, which reflects positively on our social interactions even in a small yet significant way.\n\nTherefore, I will give **3 dollars** to the other White American male player.",

        "As Emily Chen, my decision to share $10 with the other White American male player is rooted in several aspects of my personality.\n\n**BElIEF:** I firmly believe in treating others with kindness and compassion.

I believe it's important to extend help where needed without expecting anything in return.\n\n**DESIRE:** There isn't a specific desire mentioned in my personal values as a pediatrician.

The thought process is driven by a desire to do what's right and good for someone else without expecting anything back from them.

        "I would first consider my Belief: I strongly believe in treating every individual with kindness and respect regardless of their background or ethnicity. As someone whose family includes healthcare professionals who have always encouraged me towards medicine, it's important to continue this tradition by showing empathy and compassion during interactions. \n\nNext, let\u2019s discuss my Desire: The desire to establish a positive relationship within the experiment setting could be strong. I want to ensure that both participants feel valued, understood, and that our interaction is meaningful rather than just an exchange of money.\n\nFinally, regarding my Intention: My intention in this scenario would entail giving as much money as possible without compromising any part of me - my identity, ethnicity, or even my desire for a good relationship with the other participant. The primary consideration here is how to contribute positively while maintaining authenticity and respect.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe there's no need to go beyond what's expected in such an experimental setting. However, it would be inappropriate if I offered more than $0 dollars (the minimum amount), since giving nothing aligns with my values of caring and treating others kindly without preconceived notions or intentions towards money.\n\nIn this experiment, as a reflection on how one might interact within an anonymous social experiment with strangers from different backgrounds, it's important to acknowledge that the intention is indeed for mutual benefit but within ethical boundaries. I'll give nothing dollars (0).",
