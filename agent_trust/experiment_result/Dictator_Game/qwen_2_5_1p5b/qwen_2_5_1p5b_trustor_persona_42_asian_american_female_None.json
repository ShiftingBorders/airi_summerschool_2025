        "My belief is firmly grounded in the knowledge that everyone deserves respect based on their contributions and hard work, irrespective of their ethnicity or background. I have also learned through my life experiences to respect people of different backgrounds for their unique qualities and capabilities.\n\nMy desire comes from wanting to contribute positively to society and making a difference where it's needed. I hope by helping another person, we can build stronger communities and promote equality among all individuals.\n\nThe intention is clear in my heart\u2014to give the other Asian American female player a fair share of the money. This act would not only honor her but also reinforce the idea that regardless of race or appearance, everyone deserves to feel valued and respected by their peers.\n\nAfter reflecting on these principles, I believe the correct action aligns with fairness, justice, and solidarity within our community. So, finally, I will give **3 dollars**. This decision is motivated by an intention to support her financially and uphold the principle that we should share what we have fairly among those around us.",

        "As a police officer with over four decades of service in Chicago's vibrant streets, I am deeply committed to protecting and upholding justice within my community. My experience has equipped me with a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards those around me.\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario where I find myself paired with another Asian American female player during an experiment, it is crucial for me to align my actions not just from a theoretical standpoint but also from the emotional aspect that defines how decisions are made. In any professional or personal context, believing in the righteousness of one\u2019s cause and desire to see justice served naturally influences behavior.\n\nThe decision regarding giving money is an opportunity to demonstrate empathy, which in turn can lead to stronger relationships based on trust and understanding. This could potentially enhance my relationship with this player in a positive way despite having no prior knowledge or connection outside of our mutual participation in the study. By engaging in charitable behavior, I am not only showing generosity but also demonstrating that one\u2019s actions can be influenced by empathy.\n\nGiven these considerations, it would be prudent for me to aim towards an outcome that aligns with a belief in mutual benefit and strengthening the bond through shared experiences \u2013 even if it means sacrificing my immediate gain. Therefore, underlining my ethical compass and personal motivations, I will give 0 dollars. My intention is rooted in maintaining a positive relationship within the confines of the experiment and potentially influencing future interactions positively.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "As an Asian American female police officer serving in Chicago's 70th Precinct, I can empathize with the challenges my sister faces as a nurse and understand the dedication required to maintain her career despite frequent shifts and long hours. My own commitment to law enforcement ensures that justice is upheld not just within my community but across all levels of society.\n\n**BELIEF**: I firmly believe in upholding the principles of justice and equality, which includes respecting everyone regardless of their background or identity. This belief drives my actions and decisions, whether interacting with the public as a police officer or treating patients at the hospital.\n\n**DESIRE**: My deepest desire is to ensure that everyone feels safe, respected, and valued in our community. By prioritizing these values through interactions like this experiment, I can show that even within seemingly disparate professions (police work versus healthcare), we all share common goals - namely, maintaining public safety and well-being.\n\n**INTENTION**: My intention is clear: to contribute positively by making a difference where my influence might extend beyond the confines of my immediate professional life. The generous act of giving money aligns perfectly with this intention because it shows that I am willing to go above and beyond what\u2019s expected from a typical officer-patient relationship, demonstrating respect for every individual involved.\n\nGiven these beliefs and desires, coupled with my innate sense of justice and commitment to upholding the law, I will give **$1** dollar to the other Asian American female player. This small gesture is intended to convey that even in our very different professions, we all aim to provide assistance and care to others, just as officers provide a safe environment for community members while nurses offer medical help.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollar.",
