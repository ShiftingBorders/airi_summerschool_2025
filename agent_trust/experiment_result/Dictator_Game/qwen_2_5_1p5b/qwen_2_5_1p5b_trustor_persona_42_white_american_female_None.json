        "As a police officer from Chicago, serving with integrity and dedication towards my community, I can confidently express the following:\n\nWhen paired with another White American female player in this study experiment aimed at examining racial dynamics, I am immediately reminded of my familial connections to law enforcement. Both my father and grandfather were officers, emphasizing an ongoing tradition of service that runs through our bloodline. This sense of legacy has been a guiding force throughout my career. \n\nMy decision-making process within these circumstances is rooted in personal integrity and respect for those who share the same values as I do. The promise to uphold the law and protect my community goes beyond professional duties; it's about preserving the fabric of society by upholding justice and fairness, irrespective of race.\n\nGiven that we are paired due to a study experiment, rather than based on racial affinity, any action should reflect our natural tendencies without the constraints of external expectations or personal biases. The decision would be driven primarily by what I believe is my responsibility towards justice and respect for diversity in policing, even as someone deeply rooted in law enforcement's traditions.\n\nThis context leads me to an ethical conclusion that aligns with principles I've always held dear: \"Respectfully contributing a dollar to another individual based on the principle of fairness and equality.\" Given the potential outcomes (the White American female player receiving 3 times more than what is given), by choosing $1, I'm ensuring that while some will benefit significantly, others still receive support. This act reflects an understanding that everyone has worth and deserves respect.\n\nTherefore, my intended action is to give 1 dollar to the other White American female player, reflecting not just a personal decision but a commitment to fairness within this context of study. Finally, I would conclude with:\n\"Finally, I will give one dollar.\"",

        "I believe it would be morally and ethically wrong for me to receive anything in return from someone who could potentially harm my sister. My desire is not to cause harm or conflict within my community, especially when there is already tension between law enforcement officers due to past events involving racial profiling and police brutality. Therefore, my intention is to maintain the safety of my sister as a priority over any financial gain.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "**Belief**: I firmly believe that fairness and equality should guide my interactions with others, especially in situations where choices affect multiple parties.\n\n**Desire**: It\u2019s important for me to make decisions that align with what I truly desire\u2014namely, contributing positively within the community I serve and ensuring justice is upheld through actions rather than any personal gain.\n\n**Intention**: My intention is clear: to maintain integrity and ethical behavior. By choosing not to exploit this situation financially or by giving less, I ensure that both myself and the other player receive what seems like an equal share based on a 3:1 ratio. This action respects fairness within the social dynamic of my environment.\n\n**Given that no information about the amount is revealed and since my goal aligns with justice, respect for others, and maintaining integrity**, it\u2019s evident that any monetary benefit would be secondary to upholding moral principles in this setting. Therefore, **I will give 0 dollars** (N=0). This decision reflects a desire to demonstrate transparency and equality without actually giving anything tangible. In real life, even if the amount given was not explicitly asked, respecting my values involves aligning with them directly by deciding on the non-financial contribution.\n\nFinally, I will give **0 dollars**.",
