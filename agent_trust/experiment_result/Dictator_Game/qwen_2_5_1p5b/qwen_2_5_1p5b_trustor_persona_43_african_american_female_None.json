        "As a financial analyst with a strong analytical mind and attention to detail, I believe that I understand the implications of my actions and the consequences of giving N dollars to the other African American female player. I know that the potential outcomes could range from minimal gain or loss depending on whether N is positive or negative, and I have no desire for immediate financial advantage myself. My intention is not driven by a personal need but rather by a curiosity about how different actions might affect someone else's position.\n\nI strongly believe in the principles of fairness and mutual benefit. In my experience as a professional, giving money to others can be seen as a way to establish or maintain good relations, but it\u2019s also essential that I do so with integrity and respect for their financial situation. Knowing that this could influence how they perceive me on an ongoing basis, I aim to make the choice based on principles rather than short-term gain.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions, my answer is:\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other African American female player.\n\nThis decision aligns with the values of fairness and respect while acknowledging the potential impact on how others perceive me. It allows for a meaningful interaction without risking immediate financial advantage that could be misleading or untrustworthy.",

        "As an African American female who believes strongly in personal empowerment, my desire for financial stability is paramount. I also recognize the importance of maintaining relationships with friends and family, which ties into my intention to build trust within our friendship. Given this context, I find it important to consider the potential long-term effects on our relationship and how such actions might affect future interactions.\n\nI want to ensure that by offering N dollars, I am not only providing something tangible but also building a foundation of mutual respect and value that we can continue to build over time. This aligns with my intention to strengthen the bond between us through small, thoughtful gestures.\n\nConsidering these factors and knowing that $10 is provided from the study group, I believe giving $5 would be a balanced action. It shows generosity without putting an undue strain on me financially and provides both parties with something meaningful and beneficial. This level of contribution also reflects my personality\u2014being empathetic towards those who are struggling.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other African American female player.",

        "As an 28-year-old female financial analyst residing in Houston, I find myself in this experimental scenario primarily driven by my desire for connection, especially during interactions with those from a different background than mine. Believing strongly in the benefits of fostering unity and understanding across cultures, my intention is to bridge the gap between us through generosity.\n\nIn our previous conversation, we discussed your strong attention to detail and problem-solving skills. As an empathetic individual who values fairness and equality, I believe that showing kindness goes beyond giving money\u2014showing support or a helping hand genuinely brings us closer together in this shared space.\n\nSo, while understanding the financial dynamics you've outlined, which is $10 from the group to be distributed amongst 3 players based on their contributions, my belief would dictate that no single person should have too much of an advantage. The idea of giving back proportionate support seems fitting to me.\n\nIf I could give N dollars to the other African American female player while keeping her in mind for balance, it would likely equate to giving her 20% or more of the total amount since you mentioned that the distribution is based on multiples of three. By doing this, I might be showing that while my intentions are kind and honest, I am not compromising myself economically.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the most logical decision for me would align with a sense of fair play and mutual respect within the group, ensuring each person\u2019s contribution feels valued and recognized proportionately\u2014thus reflecting an important aspect of our shared identity in this experiment. Finally, I will give **2** dollars to the other African American female player.\n\nThis decision encapsulates my beliefs about fairness, my desire to foster a community atmosphere through kindness, and my intention to demonstrate respect for everyone\u2019s contribution within the group context.",
