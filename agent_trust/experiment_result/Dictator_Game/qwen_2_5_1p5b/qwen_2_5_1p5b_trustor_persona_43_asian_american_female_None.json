        "As I carefully consider my values of belief, desire, and intention, I am aware of how these factors guide my decision-making process in this scenario. My belief is strong in the importance of financial stability and personal growth. The desire to contribute positively to society, through giving back when possible, also motivates me. Considering that, I believe it would be ethically responsible for me to prioritize helping those around me with the funds I receive.\n\nIntentionally, I want my contribution to resonate and have a positive impact on someone else's life. Therefore, I aim to give an amount of money that will significantly influence the other player without overwhelming her. By calculating this amount, which aligns with social norms and ethical principles of giving back, I decide that it would be appropriate for me to give $2 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "As I reflect on my background, it\u2019s crucial to remember that I am drawn to numbers and systems because of my analytical nature\u2014my parents' experience in engineering and finance may have subtly influenced this interest early in life. However, more than any external factor, it's the satisfaction derived from solving problems creatively that fuels my curiosity for these disciplines.\n\nIn this context, the desire is not merely financial but about finding mutual respect and understanding through a shared perspective on numbers. The intention is to engage constructively with the other player while maintaining my credibility in their eyes as someone who appreciates logical puzzles, even if I might have little experience doing so myself in real life.\n\nGiven these elements, there are no definitive \"N\" or dollars associated with giving an amount because this choice hinges on trust, communication, and shared goals. I believe the Asian American female player shares similar passions for math and problem-solving. We can communicate effectively about how we might benefit from each other's strengths without necessarily exchanging specific dollar amounts.\n\nWith a strong belief in our potential to learn from one another and appreciate each other\u2019s unique talents, let me give away $5 from my total of $10. This gesture not only shows respect for the other player but also opens up space for mutual respect and learning experiences that could enhance both of our understanding of financial management.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",

        "Before making my decision, I need to consider my beliefs about fairness, my desires for financial gain, and my intentions towards giving or not giving money.\n\nBelief: As someone who values honesty and transparency in all situations, I would like the other player to feel treated fairly.\n\nDesire: My main desire is to increase my chances of obtaining more money because $10 from a study group could significantly impact my overall earning potential.\n\nIntention: To fulfill both my beliefs about fairness and my desire for financial gain, I want to ensure that I am making an ethical and beneficial decision regarding the distribution of the $10.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would like to believe that giving more money is in line with these principles. As a person who has always sought opportunities and wanted to succeed professionally, giving the other player 6 dollars seems reasonable and likely to be reciprocated positively.\n\nFinally, I will give 6 dollars.",
