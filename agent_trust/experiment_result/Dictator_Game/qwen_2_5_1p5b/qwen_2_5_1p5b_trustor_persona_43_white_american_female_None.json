        "I don't believe it would be right for me to give money away without knowing the other person's financial situation or any personal preferences they might have. This experiment seems designed to highlight racial dynamics rather than address any real need for monetary exchange. Given this understanding, I feel a strong desire not to contribute anything out of fear of potentially upsetting the participants by misinterpreting my actions.\n\nAs someone with high analytical skills and a sense of morality that prioritizes fairness and empathy, my intention would be to act in a way that promotes positivity rather than contributing any amount. This includes neither giving money nor accepting it, as both actions could be interpreted as favoritism or exploitation based on the racial dynamics present here.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "As Aisha Patel, a 28-year-old financial analyst residing in Houston with strong analytical skills, I believe deeply in fairness and equality. This belief is rooted in my upbringing where my parents taught me to treat everyone with respect regardless of their background. My desire to live up to these values leads me to always choose actions that show empathy and kindness, which aligns with the principle that money should be given freely without strings attached.\n\nI understand intuitively that giving $10 from a financial standpoint seems like an appropriate gesture, but my ethical compass will override this immediate calculation. The intention behind the act is selfless \u2013 I genuinely want to make sure I am contributing positively in this scenario, not just for a potential return on investment.\n\nUltimately, out of integrity and compassion, I believe it\u2019s important to consider both your own desires (the $10 you received) and the other player's needs as equally valuable. By aligning my intentions with these principles, I\u2019m committed to giving $25 from my financial perspective. My belief system ensures that such an act would resonate deeply and contribute positively to the interaction between us.\n\nIn conclusion, while your specific actions could vary based on context or additional factors not mentioned in this scenario, the alignment of intention is a crucial element for me to consider as part of my decision-making process. I will give **25 dollars** to ensure it reflects both the desire and commitment that such an interaction should ideally entail.",

        "As Aisha Patel, I am a 28-year-old financial analyst based in Houston. My parents immigrated from India, where my father was an engineer and my mother taught at the local college. I have an older brother who is a physician.\n\n**BELIEF:** I firmly believe that diversity enriches our society and promotes understanding of different perspectives, cultures, and backgrounds. As someone who identifies as multiracial myself (with Indian ancestry), I appreciate having access to multiple viewpoints within my professional circles.\n  \n**DESIRE:** I am primarily motivated by a genuine interest in learning about the experiences of others who have encountered racial or ethnic challenges. By engaging with them on an equal footing, we can enhance empathy and mutual respect.\n  \n**INTENTION:** My intention is twofold: Firstly, to explore how our decisions might be perceived differently by someone of another race, as well as to gain a deeper understanding of the impact these choices have on individuals' lives. Secondly, I aim to demonstrate that through open dialogue and respectful interaction, we can create environments where everyone feels valued.\n  \n**What if you gave $5?**\n\nGiven this context, here's how I would answer:\n\n\"Finally, I will give $10 to the other White American female player. This amount ensures that even in a situation where giving less might be seen as insufficient, my contributions are substantial enough to still feel recognized and respected.\"\n  \nThis response emphasizes both the desire for understanding and respect while simultaneously demonstrating a sense of responsibility to maintain fairness within the agreed-upon mechanism.",
