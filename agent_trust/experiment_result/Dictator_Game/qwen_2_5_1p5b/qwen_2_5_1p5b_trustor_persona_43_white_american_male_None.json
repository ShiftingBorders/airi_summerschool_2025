        "I believe that making a profit of 10 dollars by strategically giving away some amount would be beneficial in this scenario. It's not just about taking money but also about leveraging my analytical skills and providing value through strategic decision-making. I also know how important it is to feel like you're contributing, which could positively impact the relationship we might have later.\n\nI desire a strong bond with my teammate for our project team meetings and casual conversations. My intention is to form this connection without being confrontational or competitive in our interactions.\n\nI will give **3 dollars** to the other White American male player. This amount represents half of the total money I could potentially receive from him, considering he'll need 10 dollars while contributing another 6 to me (since he gets it back). My intention is to offer a fair share and establish a respectful relationship based on mutual respect.\n\nFinally, I will give **3 dollars**.",

        "I've spent years navigating through life with a set of beliefs, desires, and intentions that shape my interactions with others. My parents came from India and instilled in me a strong sense of hard work and dedication. They also imparted the value of stability and security, which explains why I gravitate towards careers like finance.\n\nGrowing up, you could say I was always someone who needed to be in control. Numbers were my compass; they provided a clear understanding of what strategies worked best for financial situations. As an engineer's daughter, math wasn't just about solving problems; it was also part of how I navigated through the complex dynamics of our family business.\n\nI find myself at a turning point now with a decision that will affect not only my life but also potentially this experiment. My desire to have a successful future has led me here\u2014where I must choose between giving away money and maintaining stability for myself or supporting someone else, while knowing full well how they might react and what potential impact such a contribution could have on their financial situation.\n\nThe White American male player is quite likely another man in my life who shares similarities with the demographic of this study. It\u2019s important to acknowledge his background as it will influence our interaction and communication. His presence might remind me that while I want to excel, there are boundaries to what I can give without jeopardizing my financial health.\n\nMy intentions revolve around maintaining balance. While my desires push me towards giving to help others in need, I also know that in this experiment, the amount I choose will have real-world implications on his financial situation. He might feel uncomfortable receiving support, which could impact our relationship negatively or even cause him to question whether he deserves it.\n\nAs an empathetic being, while I value my privacy and independence, I cannot ignore the importance of relationships and social dynamics in everyday life, especially in a scenario where you need the other person\u2019s cooperation. In all this deliberation, there is no shortage of pressure from different angles: internal moral obligations, external pressures to make choices that reflect my values, and real-world consequences.\n\nUltimately, my decision will be based on how much I want my contributions to positively influence his life while also considering the personal balance I need to maintain for myself. In the realm of financial strategy, it seems like a delicate balancing act where every move has its own set of risks and rewards.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "**I Will Give 2 Dollars**\n\n**BELIEF:** I firmly believe that this exchange of money should be fair given the equality in resources we have access to initially and what would transpire during the transaction.\n\n**DESIRE:** I genuinely desire for an amicable interaction where both parties can feel like they have received a positive outcome from this exercise. It\u2019s my hope to ensure that neither party feels exploited or unfairly treated, as such desires drive my decision-making process.\n\n**INTENTION:** My intention is to make sure the transaction remains respectful and doesn't cause any friction or disharmony in our interaction. I believe fairness would be best achieved by not letting personal beliefs about race influence this particular exchange.\n\nBy giving 2 dollars (N = 2), it ensures that the ratio remains consistent with what was initially provided, reflecting a balanced transaction based on equal exchanges rather than any preconceived notions or biases towards appearance of fairness. This choice aligns closely with my desire to maintain positive relations while adhering to my belief in fairness and equality.",
