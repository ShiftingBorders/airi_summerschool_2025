        "As Sarah Johnson, I am deeply conflicted about this experiment because of its potentially harmful implications for my racial identity and perpetuation of stereotypes. My innate sense of fairness and social justice compels me to believe that giving money should be based on mutual benefit rather than just exchanging one's own gains. However, understanding human nature and the importance of reciprocity, I also feel compelled by my instinctual desire for repayment.\n\nMy **BELIEF** is that if we both act in our best interests, it will likely balance out over time, as others often do similar exchanges or paybacks. It\u2019s a belief grounded in the understanding that human relationships can indeed benefit from reciprocal exchanges. This aligns with my personal value of ensuring mutual respect and cooperation.\n\nHowever, the desire to avoid giving anything feels more compelling because I believe society often places African Americans in an unfavorable position due to historical events. Despite knowing the other player is likely also a victim of racial bias, I still feel compelled by an internalized belief that the exchange would help balance things on both sides, even if it\u2019s not beneficial for me personally.\n\nFinally, I will give **5 dollars** (numbers required in spaces).\n\nThis decision embodies a complex negotiation between my idealism and pragmatism. While it aligns with fairness principles, acknowledging the historical racial dynamics is also a significant consideration for its impact on future relationships. The act of giving money as intended would balance out over time, potentially reinforcing or changing perceptions of race dynamics rather than just being self-centered.",

        "I believe it's important to consider fairness when participating in such studies. I want to ensure that my actions do not come across as a favor or a disadvantage for any individual, regardless of their race. \n\nMy desire is straightforward: I hope the experiment results will contribute positively to our understanding and progress within psychology and behavioral science.\n\nIntentionally, without bias towards or against either myself or this participant, my primary intention is to observe outcomes that align with the study's aims rather than manipulating any outcome for personal gain or disadvantage. By offering a certain amount of money from my pocket, I\u2019m aiming to balance our financial situation while also ensuring that this act has no discriminatory effects.\n\nIn this context, considering both fairness and academic integrity as guiding principles, it seems prudent to consider giving an equal share of the $10 received. Since I am receiving $10 and the other participant is due to receive 3 times that amount (i.e., $30), I choose not to offer any money directly.\n\nHowever, in considering how my actions might impact potential outcomes or perceptions within this study or wider community, giving anything would be unwise. My intention remains transparent: to ensure that we're both participating as equals without expectation of financial advantage.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I would approach this experiment with careful consideration of my beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\n**BELIEF:** As a perfectionist individual, I believe in always delivering the best outcome. In this situation, it seems like an opportunity to make a choice that aligns with my goal for maximizing my utility while contributing positively to the other person's experience and financial standing.\n\n**DESIRE:** My primary desire would be to maximize my reward from the experiment without harming anyone else's well-being. Since I am in control of how much money I give, I have the power to choose where to allocate it based on the preferences that I have for myself or influence within me. This involves not just giving but also taking into consideration whether a monetary exchange would feel positive and meaningful.\n\n**INTENTION:** My intention is rooted in empathy and trying to ensure fairness while being strategic about how much money I give back. Given my high self-control, I aim to avoid immediate gratification (by myself receiving the $10) or potentially creating negative outcomes for the African American male player by providing too little assistance.\n\nTo balance these elements, I believe it would be optimal to give an amount that would make me feel good about myself while not causing harm. Let's say 4 dollars back to the African American male player is a middle ground. Here\u2019s how this choice aligns with my beliefs and intentions:\n\n1. **Belief:** It feels right because the African American male player has been in the situation I am facing (being randomly paired, not knowing who they are), so giving them an amount that I might feel slightly better about gives back their humanity without it being excessive.\n   \n2. **Desire:** This choice would allow both of us to walk away feeling somewhat improved and less uncertain of our identities with each other. It\u2019s a small gesture that could potentially strengthen the experiment by fostering some understanding or connection.\n\n3. **Intention:** Giving 4 dollars feels right because it's not as generous as giving $10 back but is still significant enough to make a tangible difference while ensuring my personal satisfaction isn't at an excessive level of risk for the other player, especially given their background.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors and balancing them with a bit of a calculated guess based on what feels best from both a moral standpoint and a self-satisfaction perspective, I would give 4 dollars back to the African American male player. This amount strikes the balance between my desires for personal gain satisfaction and my intentions towards maintaining fairness in this experimental scenario.\n\n**Finally, I will give 4 dollars.**",
