        "I feel compelled to ensure fairness in this arrangement despite my desire for personal gain. My intention is to make sure this situation reflects the value of honesty and mutual respect. In my belief, treating people equitably and ensuring reciprocity is fundamental. It\u2019s important to believe that both parties can benefit from a fair outcome without feeling entitled or resentful.\n\nGiven these considerations, I feel it would be in my best interest to give back 1 dollar rather than the full amount of 9 dollars. This act reflects honesty by acknowledging the other person's right to receive what they expect and maintaining an ethical stance towards fairness.\n\nUltimately, after giving thought to these beliefs and desires, my intention is clear: I will give **1** dollar.",
