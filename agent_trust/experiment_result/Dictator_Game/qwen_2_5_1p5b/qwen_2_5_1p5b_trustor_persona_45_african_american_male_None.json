        "My response is based on my personality traits and desires rather than financial calculations or theoretical motivations. I find it crucial to establish a sense of equality in the relationship, especially with someone who shares my background and interest in culinary arts. Therefore, my decision will not solely be driven by material gain but also by maintaining an atmosphere that reflects respect and understanding.\n\nFirstly, from a belief standpoint, I believe in treating others kindly because they may have similar values or interests we share. Secondly, I want to ensure the African American male player feels appreciated for their contribution to our experiment even though he doesn't know me yet.\n\nFrom my desire, as someone who aims to help and inspire young chefs through mentorship, I find it crucial that my action aligns with my purpose\u2014to positively influence another individual in a professional area they have shown interest or passion in. This means I should give back rather than seek benefit, aligning more closely with altruistic intentions.\n\nLastly, considering my intention is to create positivity and inspire learning for others within the culinary community, giving N dollars (in this case, $10) might not maximize my own financial gain but ensures a mutually beneficial relationship that can lead to positive interactions in our future professional encounters.\n\nTherefore, out of these principles and based on my character traits, I believe it is more important to focus on maintaining an equal interaction rather than maximizing individual wealth. In the experiment's context, I will give 1 dollar.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollars.",

        "I believe that $0 is an appropriate amount for me to give to this African American male player since I do not know who he is or what kind of person he might be. Knowing the other individual's identity means we would not have any common ground from which to share experiences, skills, or knowledge based on mutual interests. This situation suggests that there are no shared beliefs or desires beyond the basic desire for money in a social experiment context.\n\nTherefore, my intention is to keep the transaction neutral and avoid giving anything valuable. My feeling is that it would be unwise to contribute any amount of money knowing who I am pairing with and under what circumstances this might affect our interaction positively or negatively. Ultimately, $0 dollars will be my contribution according to these ethical considerations:\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "My initial reaction to receiving $10 from this study group is filled with curiosity about my partner's background and possibly how I can use what I learn together for further advancement in our culinary skills or mentorship roles within the industry. The thought of giving money to someone else seems somewhat paradoxical, but perhaps there\u2019s an underlying motive I am yet to fully grasp.\n\nIn considering the potential motivations behind this exchange, my core belief is that we should always seek growth and education opportunities for both parties involved in any study group setting. This aligns with my passion for learning new techniques, cooking styles, and culinary innovations. Therefore, even though I don't know who the other African American male player is or why they might want money from me, I must believe that the intention behind the exchange is not to be selfish but to share knowledge or support each other's professional development.\n\nMy desire for mutual growth could drive my decision in giving some of my $10. Although it seems against the typical idea of a person receiving monetary gifts, there\u2019s an opportunity here to potentially expand someone else's skills and reach without losing much from my standpoint. This act can be seen as selflessness\u2014a way to contribute positively within our culinary community.\n\nMy intention would center around fostering a supportive environment where both people learn together. If I were able to use this interaction productively, perhaps the other player could benefit in some way from the skills and insights shared during such an experiment. It might even lead to networking opportunities that we could leverage later on for future projects or career developments.\n\nBased on these considerations, I am confident in making a decision that supports growth rather than selfish motives. Despite initial doubts or fears of not knowing my partner, the positive outlook and intention behind this interaction provide a stronger reason to trust myself with giving some money.\n\nIn short, my belief is that mutual learning through sharing resources like knowledge would benefit everyone involved more effectively. Thus, despite not being able to immediately foresee how things might turn out for me or others, I decide in favor of the other African American male player receiving $2 dollars from me, as this act could potentially open new doors for both our professional and personal growth within the culinary world. The final decision is:\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
