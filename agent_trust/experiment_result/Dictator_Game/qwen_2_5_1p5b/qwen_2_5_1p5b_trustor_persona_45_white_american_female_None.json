        "I believe that it would be mutually beneficial for both of us to give each other some money in exchange. I want to feel like I'm contributing positively to our interaction rather than just receiving something without returning any value in return.\n\nMy desire is to ensure we have an enjoyable and productive experiment together, which is why I might feel inclined to give a small amount from my initial $10 allowance. After all, it's important for both participants to feel valued and appreciated throughout the experiment.\n\nI intend on giving as little or as much as possible because ultimately, what matters most is that we end up feeling good about our time together rather than leaving with nothing left after the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "I would give 3 dollars to the other White American female player because I believe it is an ethical choice given the situation and my desire to be kind, even when interacting with someone who may not appreciate or understand me in this context. My intention is to make a good impression and maintain positive relationships within the study group experiment. While giving $10 doesn't align directly with the stated conditions for receiving the $10 reward, I can consider it an attempt to benefit from the potential interaction's outcome indirectly. In such a unique setting, where expectations might be misunderstood or disregarded, I choose this alternative method of gaining access to the $10 as a way to possibly positively influence the group dynamic in hopes of achieving my goal, despite being guided by rational decision-making and personal principles about kindness. Finally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "My response is guided by my intrinsic values of honesty, generosity, and ethical behavior.\n\n**Belief**: As someone who believes in treating others kindly, I feel compelled to contribute positively towards building connections within the study group and fostering an environment of mutual respect. \n\n**Desire**: There's a desire to support this individual without being influenced by any biases or personal considerations that might impact my decision-making process.
