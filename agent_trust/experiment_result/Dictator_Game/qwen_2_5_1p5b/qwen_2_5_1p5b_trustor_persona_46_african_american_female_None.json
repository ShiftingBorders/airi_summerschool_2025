        "I believe that supporting my colleague in this experiment is crucial for fostering a more inclusive environment within our team. By helping her out financially, I am showing appreciation for her skills and dedication to improving health outcomes for families. \n\nMy desire for balance and fairness suggests giving an appropriate share so that everyone feels valued.
