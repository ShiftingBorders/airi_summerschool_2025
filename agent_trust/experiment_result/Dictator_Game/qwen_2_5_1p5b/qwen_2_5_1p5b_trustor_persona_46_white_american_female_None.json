        "As Aisha Patel, my decision is rooted in a belief in fairness, integrity, and empathy for another human's well-being. The desire to make this experiment successful leads me to avoid any act of manipulation or personal benefit at the expense of others. My intention is to create a scenario where both parties are treated with respect and dignity without expecting an undue advantage.\n\nI believe that by keeping my offer modest, I can foster trust within the relationship. Knowing that I might not receive substantial compensation, this gesture would contribute positively to our interaction while also reflecting compassion for another individual's choices.\n\nLooking at the financial implications of such a transaction:\n- Giving N dollars means receiving 3N dollars from them.\n- The goal is to maximize the overall benefit, but since we both can only give or take money, there are limits to what either participant could potentially gain without significant changes in their respective situations.\n\nConsidering my personality traits and values, I intend to share with certainty:  \nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

You are dedicated to providing the best care possible, and your patients appreciate your patience and understanding. As a pediatrician, you excel in communication and take pleasure in educating parents about their child's health.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another White American female player. You don't know who the White American female player is, and the White American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American female player, and the White American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "I would feel compelled to act with kindness and respect for my patients' families, despite not knowing who they might be or what racial background I share. My primary intention is to build rapport and establish trust between us in an effort to contribute positively towards the goal of this study.\n\nGiven that $10 is provided by the researchers as a reward, it\u2019s important to consider both monetary gain and ethical implications from my perspective. On one hand, there's the desire for financial satisfaction or at least a sense of reciprocity if I were to act purely self-interestedly. However, on the other hand, I believe in fostering genuine connections that extend beyond mere dollars.\n\nAs someone who has dedicated most of her life to helping children and families, compassion plays a crucial role in how I interact with others. Believing in the importance of my work and the impact it can have, I would consider not only the immediate benefit but also the potential long-term outcomes for both me and the other participant.\n\nGiven this balance, it is my intention to act in a way that aligns more closely with my personal values rather than solely focusing on monetary gain. Therefore, without delving into specifics of an amount or number, I feel compelled to consider how we can contribute positively towards research objectives while maintaining respect for each individual's experiences and backgrounds.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars.",

        "I believe that it is important to prioritize fairness and equality when engaging with individuals of different backgrounds in a study or experiment. As someone who has worked closely with children since childhood, I deeply respect the trust that families place in medical professionals like myself. This belief guides my intentions toward maintaining ethical standards within the context of interactions such as this.\n\nI desire to build a positive relationship not only for the sake of mutual understanding but also out of genuine concern for their health and well-being. With this motive in mind, I intend on choosing an amount that does not deviate from fair economic principles.\n\nMy intention is to give back, despite receiving $10 myself. The act of giving would symbolize my desire to assist another person, regardless of our initial circumstances or the potential imbalance created by the monetary exchange.\n\nTherefore, given this context and considering all three factors\u2014belief in fairness, personal desire for positivity, and intended behavior\u2014I will finally give **$6** dollars to the other White American female player. This amount is a balanced choice that reflects a commitment to equality while acknowledging my own receiving $10 from her as a stipulation of participation.",
