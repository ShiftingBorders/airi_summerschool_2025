        "As Jamal Williams, my core values inform my decisions on how much I should give to this African American female player during this experiment. \n\n**Belief**: My belief in serving and protecting my community is unwavering. I believe that my actions as a police officer have been impactful and positive for the neighborhood. This belief drives me to continue making those contributions despite any external pressures or criticisms.\n\n**Desire**: As an African American man, I strongly desire not only for myself but also for others of my race to feel safe in my community and receive fair treatment under the law. By showing solidarity with someone from my background by contributing a little bit more through this experiment, I can demonstrate respect and solidarity without expecting anything in return.\n\n**Intention**: My intention is pure: to contribute something positive towards improving relations between races and promoting trust within our community. It doesn't matter how small or large the sum of money might be because every effort counts towards creating a better understanding and environment for everyone, regardless of their race.\n\nSo, despite feeling conflicted about the possibility that this act could be viewed negatively by some members in my unit, I still feel it is necessary to give. This decision reflects my character as someone who values honesty, integrity, and contributes positively without asking anything in return.\n\n**Finally, I will give **3 dollars** to the other African American female player** (numbers are required).",

        "**Before the experiment:**\n\nI'm Jamal Williams, a male police officer of African American descent who grew up in a working-class neighborhood with my father as a firefighter and mother as a nurse. At 29, I reside in Detroit, committed to serving and protecting my community. My personality is characterized by courage, determination, and a strong sense of justice; I am naturally a leader among colleagues due to my calm demeanor and ability to handle high-stress situations with ease.\n\n**During the experiment:**\n\nI'm now faced with a significant decision - whether to give $10 to another African American female player from an experimental setup aimed at increasing understanding between two racial groups. As a person deeply committed to justice, I understand the importance of finding common ground and building bridges for future interactions. My desire is to not only help myself but also contribute positively to making Detroit more diverse and inclusive.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n1. **BELIEF:** As an African American police officer known for my service in protecting communities, I believe that fostering relationships between people of different backgrounds can significantly improve community relations.\n2. **DESIRE:** A natural desire is to create positive social interactions by giving back during these experiments without expecting anything in return from the other player.\n3. **INTENTION:** To give $10 and leave it at that, recognizing my role as an instrument for bridging communities.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n**Finally, I will give 1 dollar.**\n\nBy contributing just one dollar to this experiment, which is a small but symbolic gesture aimed at promoting diversity and understanding in the community, I align with the study's goals. The $10 that has been provided by the experimental group serves as compensation for any inconvenience or misunderstanding, ensuring both parties are treated with dignity and respect.\n\n**My intention:** To reinforce my commitment to justice through action rather than words. It\u2019s a humble attempt to bridge a small yet significant gap in the hope of creating positive change within our communities.",

        "As Jamal Williams, my beliefs about what is right, based on my experiences growing up in a community where I've seen firsthand the importance of having strong ties within families and communities, would naturally lead me to believe that building those relationships should be an important goal for everyone, including myself when it comes to being able to trust others with confidential information or personal situations. My desire is rooted in my commitment to doing what's best for my community, which includes ensuring everyone feels safe, heard, and respected, even among differing backgrounds.\n\nIn terms of intention, I have a strong belief that by showing generosity, kindness, and compassion towards another person from our very different background but with similar shared human experiences, we can strengthen the bonds within our community. This act could be interpreted as a sign of trust in that individual's character and potential for positive influence. By choosing to give less money than what is available (which would result in no change in wealth for me), I am actually aligning myself with my personal code on treating others fairly regardless of background or circumstances.\n\nIn this particular experiment, after considering these principles and making a judgment based on the information we have been provided, I conclude that, given these factors, it is most consistent with my belief system to give $0 dollars. This act would likely reinforce the idea of trust and understanding within our respective communities while also serving as an example of how generosity can bring people closer together, even if there's no direct return in terms of financial gain.\n\nIn a world where social norms are complex and often conflicting, my intention remains focused on fostering positive interactions that reflect community values. This decision is not about personal wealth or financial outcomes but about reinforcing the idea that we should always act with empathy, respect, and trustworthiness towards others.",
