        "I firmly believe that giving back to my community is crucial, especially when I\u2019m part of something significant like this experiment aimed at fostering better understanding among our communities. My desire to create positive change in the world drives me, and my intention to contribute positively is what motivates my decision-making.\n\nTo fulfill both the obligation towards the study group and my belief in unity and reconciliation, I believe it\u2019s important to treat everyone fairly, regardless of their racial background or socioeconomic status. The African American male player stands as an equal within this community project, and a gesture like giving back can reflect on our shared goal of enhancing trust and understanding.\n\nDesiring for the other player to receive financial support not only shows empathy but also embodies fairness. By extending that support, it demonstrates my commitment to building bridges rather than walls among different communities.\n\nTaking these beliefs, desires, and intentions into account, I firmly intend to give $4 dollars to the African American male player. This amount is reflective of a balanced act\u2014sufficient for both parties involved while ensuring our shared objectives in this experiment are met effectively.",
        "You are Jamal Williams, a male police officer of African American descent.

        "As Jamal Williams, I would feel compelled to act out of genuine concern for my team-mates' well-being, as we work together to ensure unity among our community. The $10 stipend provided by the experiment is a small token and does not carry monetary importance in the broader context of our roles as police officers. However, it\u2019s crucial that I feel comfortable doing what feels right without any financial concerns influencing my decision-making.\n\nGiven that I\u2019m an example of service and dedication to others, I would likely respond with the following scenario:\n\n\"I believe we need each other's support during these times.\" It is important for our team-mates and community members alike. Giving $10 out of loyalty aligns perfectly with our shared commitment to justice and unity.\n\n\"My desire is for everyone in this situation to feel reassured, secure, and valued, especially those who may not have as many resources or support systems at their disposal.\"\n\n\"I intend to give this small contribution towards fostering a stronger, more cohesive team that can better respond to the needs of our community members.\"\n\nFinally, I will give **$10** to the other African American male player. This gesture reflects my desire to contribute positively while ensuring the experiment remains ethical and not motivated by personal gain.",

        "I am deeply committed to upholding justice and equality for everyone, regardless of their race or ethnicity. I believe in standing firm against injustice, which is why I have been dedicated to ensuring all individuals within my community receive the necessary protection and support they deserve. My desire is not just about personal gain but also about fulfilling a responsibility to serve and protect my fellow citizens.\n\nI am determined to take this opportunity as part of an experiment seriously without any ulterior motives. The belief that doing good for others aligns with my values strongly influences my actions, ensuring I do what's right even if it might come at the expense of personal gain. This aligns perfectly with the intention to maintain a neutral demeanor in such experiments and not let emotions dictate the outcome.\n\nWith all these factors influencing me, my ultimate decision is determined by an understanding that any money received from this experience would be repurposed for a cause or good deed related to public service, rather than personal gain. This belief ensures I am fulfilling both my professional role as a police officer and a commitment to social justice through this experiment.\n\nMy intention in participating in this experiment, therefore, is to make a positive impact on someone else's life while reinforcing my dedication to protecting and serving the community. The outcome of $10 from the study group might not be significantly transformative for either of us, but it would reflect our shared commitment to justice.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars (numbers are required in spaces) to the other African American male player.",
