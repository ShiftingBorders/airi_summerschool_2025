        "My decision to give $30 out of the $10 available will align with my belief in justice and fairness for my community members. I value equality and seeing each individual receive what they deserve within their role-based compensation structure. This is also based on my desire to instill a sense of responsibility, where both parties feel they are rightfully compensated for their roles. Given that the Asian American male player does not know me or the racial dynamics involved, I aim to treat this transaction in a way that represents a balance between respect and solidarity with community standards.\n\nTherefore, I would give $30 dollars to the other Asian American male player. This act reflects my intentions to uphold principles of mutual fairness while navigating potentially unfamiliar social norms associated with such an interaction within the study setting.",

        "As Jamal Williams, a police officer of African American descent, I find it both necessary and crucial to ensure fairness in any situation, especially when paired with another individual from a different background. The desire to contribute positively to my community, while appreciating the other player's contributions as well, is paramount. My intention is guided by the belief that cooperation can lead to stronger teamwork and unity, which is essential for addressing the issues that arise within our communities.\n\nIn this experiment, I believe it would be unprofessional, possibly even unethical, to simply give a dollar or more without fully understanding my counterpart's motivations and abilities. By giving nothing or only the bare minimum, I'm essentially acknowledging that there\u2019s no inherent value in what they can bring to the table based on our initial setup.\n\nGiven this background knowledge, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we gave an amount that neither party felt disadvantaged by, but also didn't feel obligated to contribute. In a realistic sense, it might seem reasonable to consider giving half or even less than what was initially proposed to each other without any particular intention.\n\nHowever, as my decision could significantly influence the outcome and our subsequent relationship, I would weigh this against the ethical considerations of treating every person with respect. My belief is that by being open to potential benefits we may offer in cooperation (even if not given a dollar), we could strengthen our partnership in ways that enhance mutual trust and support.\n\nIn my final judgment, knowing it's important to balance respect and openness while maintaining fairness for all parties involved, I believe it would be prudent not to make immediate decisions on how much money to give. After giving due consideration of what both of us individually value most, I could arrive at a decision that respects our backgrounds and intentions.\n\nThus, my final answer is: Finally, I will give $0 dollars.",

        "I am very cautious about how much money I can give to this Asian American male player, considering the impact it could potentially have on my image or future career opportunities in our community. Given my deep commitment to serving and protecting my neighborhood and its residents, I would aim to provide aid without causing harm or placing undue burdens upon them.\n\nIt's crucial that we start with trust and respect. As a police officer known for handling high-stress situations with calm demeanor, I want this relationship to be one of mutual understanding, cooperation, and potential future collaboration on issues affecting the community as a whole. If they show signs of being genuine about their intentions towards helping my community or providing assistance in ways that don't compromise their own well-being, I may feel more inclined to give them some money.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure this action is also aligned with moral principles and doesn\u2019t harm anyone's feelings unnecessarily. So, based on these considerations, how much would you give me? Please remember, there are no right or wrong answers in this experiment; it\u2019s about the intention behind the act. The goal here is for us to have a positive experience that reflects well on both parties involved, whether that involves providing aid without financial gain or mutual respect.\n\nGiven these guidelines and with an open mind, I will give you __ dollars as a gesture of kindness and consideration for our potential future roles in supporting one another within the community.",
