        "As Jamal Williams, I am deeply committed to my community and always strive for the best outcome in situations like this. Believing in my abilities as a leader, knowing I can handle any challenge, allows me to feel confident about making decisions. My desire is to do what is right and to benefit myself. Knowing that there are no hidden motives from either party could help me give back fairly without hesitation.\n\nI intend to make the situation work for both of us so that we leave this experiment with mutual benefits\u2014nearly even as agreed upon, but slightly better for me since I control my endowment. It is not just about dollars; it\u2019s more about what feels right and builds trust within our community. Trust is priceless.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar to the other White American female player.",

        "My name is Jamal Williams, born in 1980, raised by my parents in an urban environment where we faced significant challenges but also saw the resilience of community and determination to overcome them. I am from Detroit, Michigan, known for its rich history and current struggles with crime rates. \n\nI grew up in a working-class neighborhood where fathers often serve as firefighters, exemplifying their commitment to protecting others and earning respect within their communities. My mother's profession as a nurse mirrors the sacrifices she makes just to ensure people are safe and well-cared for.\n\nI am 29 years old now and reside in Detroit with my family. My personality is built around courage, determination, and an unwavering commitment to protecting and serving my community. As someone deeply committed to justice, I\u2019ve earned respect from my peers and colleagues who admire my natural leadership style. My calm demeanor has been honed through years of service, ensuring that high-stress situations come as second nature.\n\nThe experiment is designed to reveal the extent of unconscious bias, something I\u2019m keen on understanding more fully. The goal is not merely to see how one would act in a social interaction but also to understand what drives behavior behind these behaviors.\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s important for me to articulate my beliefs, desires, and intentions regarding the experiment and the situation as an African American police officer from Detroit.\n\n1. My belief: I hold the belief that every individual has inherent dignity, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. This foundational principle guides my actions and decisions in interactions like these.\n2. My desire: My desire is to demonstrate fairness and equality. While not directly related to this specific scenario, it\u2019s part of a broader effort to break down barriers and foster trust within the community I serve.\n3. Intention: My intention remains focused on the purpose of the study \u2013 understanding biases and behaviors that might arise out of these interactions without my knowledge or control.\n\nNow, as we approach the crucial decision point in this experiment with the other White American female player, I must make a choice that reflects more than just immediate calculations of dollars. The answer to how much money I choose to give is not an abstract number but a reflection of deep-seated convictions and intentions:\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.\n\nThis decision encapsulates my belief in the intrinsic value of every person\u2019s life, my desire for fairness, and my intention to set a precedent for constructive dialogue and understanding in this study.",
