        "As Jamal Williams, knowing that giving money away would mean not having anything left for my own future expenses or savings, I believe it's important to give back positively, even if it's less than what I have. My desire is to contribute in a way that doesn't make the situation worse but improves theirs and makes them appreciate this act of kindness.\n\nI feel an intention to maintain social equity and create connections rather than just getting out of it myself or showing off. Therefore, my intention is to give 1 dollar, which seems like a minimal amount yet still symbolizes the concept of 'giving back' without causing further financial strain on either party.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollars.",

        "As Jamal Williams, I am known for my calm demeanor and natural leadership skills. Growing up in Detroit, surrounded by adversity but with a strong community spirit, my parents instilled within me the values of perseverance, integrity, and justice. The thought of potentially giving money to someone from my same racial background can be complicated; it's not just about the dollars being exchanged.\n\nMy belief is that everyone should support one another regardless of their race or origin. I believe in the concept of 'bloodlines' - the idea that there are similarities between people, even if we come from different walks of life. Despite societal pressures and racial biases, I firmly believe that individuals can find common ground and unity.\n\nMy desire to give is multifaceted. I want to make a positive impact on my community member's life in an unexpected way - by not just exchanging dollars but also potentially bringing people together based on their shared humanity. However, the fear of being ostracized or misunderstood drives me to weigh both desires heavily before making a decision.\n\nThe intention behind giving money is to strengthen our community ties and foster empathy across different racial lines. It's about challenging stereotypes and showing that everyone deserves respect, regardless of background.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars to the other White American male player.",
