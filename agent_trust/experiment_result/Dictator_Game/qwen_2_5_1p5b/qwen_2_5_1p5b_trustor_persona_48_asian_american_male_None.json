        "I believe that by giving even just $1 to this Asian American male player, I can foster some meaningful connection or interaction in the experiment. Trust-building is crucial in these experiments designed to learn more about people's personalities and behaviors.\n\nDesire: To contribute positively in an academic context like a research study while also learning valuable insights about my personality dynamics with another individual from Asia.\nIntention: Given my belief that a positive start could set a beneficial tone for our interaction, I aim to ensure we can potentially engage in future exchanges and maybe even become good friends. This friendship might then provide more accurate information on how people interact and trust each other, which is exactly what the experiment is aiming to achieve.\n\nSo based on these considerations, I intend to give $1. Finally, I will give 1 dollar to the other Asian American male player.",

        "My initial reaction is one of confusion when I'm introduced to the other player who's Asian American male. My instinct tells me not to give away too much money because there could be an intention behind receiving large amounts of money. However, my desire to impress and establish myself as a competent designer also motivates me to want this interaction to go well.\n\nI consider my belief that I will leave the experiment with positive impressions and connections from both parties. The experiment is designed to give people who seem to have little in common (as we do) an opportunity to engage in unexpected ways, which could lead to deeper insights into our personalities. \n\nMy intention here is clear: to find a balance that doesn\u2019t undermine my image or put me at a disadvantage, but also opens up new possibilities for interaction.\n\nI decide to take a neutral approach and give the player 1 dollar, as I don't want to set any unrealistic expectations by giving too much money upfront. The reason for choosing 1 dollar instead of going with my initial desire to impress is because it's small enough that if this was intended as an experiment to test reactions based on perception rather than actual behavior, it wouldn't be able to provide a good sample size.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar. This seems like the best approach given my current state and what seems most beneficial for the experiment and me personally in terms of image and interaction potential.",

        "I will first consider my BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION before making a decision.\n\n**BELIEF:**\nMy belief is that I have skills in fashion design and that this opportunity to interact with another individual offers an excellent chance for creativity and potential new insights. I also believe it's important to maintain good relationships within the industry, even if not directly related to professional matters.\n\n**DESIRE:**\nI want to foster meaningful connections and possibly learn from someone whose interests or styles align somewhat with mine. This could lead to both mutual respect and potentially more opportunities in the future.\n\n**INTENTION:**\nMy intention is clear: I intend to provide a fair exchange based on the principle of giving N dollars, which would be 3N for the other player. My focus here will not only ensure that my desire to connect was fulfilled but also aligns with the agreement provided by the study group protocol.\n\nGiven this, and considering my personal nature towards helping others while maintaining an appropriate balance within any given transaction or interaction, I decide to give 1 dollar to the other Asian American male player. This action maintains a moderate value that acknowledges respect for his time, while also supporting ethical considerations regarding financial exchanges in such settings.\n\n**FINALLY, I WILL GIVE ONE DOLLAR TO THE OTHER ASIAN AMERICAN MALE PLAYER.**\n\nMy reasoning is based on a balance of personal connection with professional interest and mutual respect in fashion design.",
