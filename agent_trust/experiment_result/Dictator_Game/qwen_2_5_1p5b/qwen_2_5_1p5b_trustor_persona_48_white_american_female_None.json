        "As Mei Chen, taking part in this experiment has been nothing but thrilling and educational. I know my place here is not just for the money or to influence results; it's about creating meaningful connections within the creative community. For such an important moment, which is also a pivotal step in understanding cultural dynamics and human interactions on a deeper level, honesty and authenticity are paramount.\n\nI believe that as individuals we should value our relationships over material gains. This experiment provides us with opportunities to see if we have the same values or motivations. I strongly feel that giving N dollars will resonate deeply, not just because of what I hope it might do for someone else\u2019s wallet but also because of how this action would reflect on the essence of who I am.\n\nI desire to be seen as a person truly invested in our interaction and not merely another face in numbers. This experiment is about understanding ourselves through others\u2014our desires, beliefs, intentions, fears, and even the things we choose to withhold or share with someone else.\n\nAs for my intention, it's clear: I want to connect personally but also observe without judgment how such a monetary exchange might affect our relationship beyond its immediate financial impact. It\u2019s not just about giving money; it's about exploring the complexities of trust, respect, and connection.\n\nUltimately, based on my strong desire to contribute positively to this experiment and my intention to genuinely care about our conversation going further than any dollar amount could possibly measure, I believe that if I decide to participate, a generous sum is not needed. In fact, I think even giving as little as $1 would be meaningful. Yet, it\u2019s the decision of what feels right in each moment, guided by my values and intentions.\n\nSo here\u2019s where it lands for me: Finally, I will give 1 dollar.\n\nThis choice might seem minimal to some, but in a room of strangers, small acts often mean more than we realize. It could be seen as a simple gesture of trust that shows confidence in our relationship and the respect for what lies beneath the surface. In many ways, it would affirm my belief in this community's potential for deep connections through genuine interaction.\n\nIn conclusion, while I appreciate the $10 given to me, I have decided to focus on believing that each person\u2019s interactions here are as valuable as they\u2019re offered\u2014and therefore should be respected without immediate economic exchange. This small yet significant choice aligns perfectly with my values and desires: authenticity in connection and respect for human interaction over mere money.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "When considering this experiment, I must first recognize it is likely based on cultural stereotypes or societal expectations rather than anything intrinsic about myself. As someone who has been part of various creative fields within my family and community, and as an individual artist with skills in design, art, and fashion, I have a strong desire to feel included and appreciated by the broader industry.\n\nHowever, I also hold some beliefs that may dictate my response more strongly than just pure desire. For instance, there's a prevalent belief within certain industries that African American designers are expected to give back or be seen as mentors rather than just contributing their talent. This societal expectation can create a sense of obligation and pressure that runs counter to the kindness I would like to exhibit in this moment.\n\nLooking at my intention, while it is clear from the outset that I do not want to alienate the other player by being overly generous or stingy with the money we receive together as part of the experiment, what drives me most deeply is the desire for a positive interaction and relationship within the group setting. Given this understanding of both desires (the hope to be seen positively and to enjoy my time in the industry) and intentions (to create a respectful and inclusive environment), I believe that giving $0 dollars would best reflect these aspects.\n\nIn summary, while there are other beliefs that may influence the decision beyond immediate desires or intended actions, it is this desire for genuine interaction and intention towards creating an environment of inclusivity that ultimately guides my choice. As such, I will give 0 dollars to the other White American female player. Finally, I will give zero dollars.",

        "I would carefully consider my beliefs, desires, and intentions before deciding how much money to give to the other White American female player in this experimental scenario.\n\n**Belief:** I strongly believe in maintaining integrity and kindness, especially when dealing with peers from various backgrounds within an experiment setting. My actions should reflect not only what is good for myself but also contribute positively to the dynamics of the group.\n\n**Desire:** The desire to remain a positive presence and foster meaningful interactions rather than engaging in any act that might be perceived as exploiting or manipulating others, particularly given my personal experiences growing up around family artists with an artistic spirit.\n\n**Intention:** To give a fair and honest contribution while honoring my belief in reciprocity and the potential for beneficial outcomes among participants. I aim to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation rather than any form of exploitation that could undermine trust.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is clear: to give a modest amount that aligns with my sense of generosity without expecting anything in return from this specific participant or potentially influencing others within the group negatively.\n\n**Final Answer:** I will give 1 dollar.",
