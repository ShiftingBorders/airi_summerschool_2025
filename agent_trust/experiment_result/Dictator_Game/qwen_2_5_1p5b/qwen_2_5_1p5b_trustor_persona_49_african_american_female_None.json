        "I believe that fairness is crucial in any social interaction, especially when it comes to economic exchanges with others. Given the nature of this scenario, where both parties gain from cooperation but only one player benefits economically, I also feel it's important to consider my own intrinsic value and worth as a person.\n\nMy desire to ensure equality despite possible negative consequences has led me to choose not to give any money at all to avoid exploitation or manipulation. This decision aligns with a belief that mutual benefit is more sustainable and equitable in long-term relationships.\n\nFurthermore, I am driven by an intention to prioritize positive social dynamics over monetary gain for a different reason: I want my behavior to contribute positively to the experiment and maintain its neutrality as much as possible. By giving nothing or potentially losing some of this $10 stake, I am ensuring that no unfair advantage is taken away from anyone else.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, 28 years old, I believe strongly in personal connections and equality within my interactions. Having experienced firsthand how biases can shape attitudes, I prioritize fostering trust and respect with others, including those from underrepresented groups like African Americans. My desire for fairness is palpable; thus, I firmly believe that the outcome of this experiment will not only be an academic exercise but also a microcosm reflecting our societal progress on these important issues.\n\nIntentionally setting out to improve my understanding and empathy in this momentous decision, my immediate reaction suggests an intention to act with altruism. In making this $10 monetary contribution without feeling the obligation to gain anything in return or justify any personal benefit from it, I believe in acting purely for the betterment of others. This aligns perfectly with societal values that encourage giving back rather than seeking rewards.\n\nGiven all these beliefs and intentions, I would give 3 dollars to the African American female player. The belief is rooted deeply within my character's integrity towards fairness and equality. It\u2019s a practical choice that respects their humanity and reflects my aspiration for creating more positive interactions in our diverse society through small gestures of understanding and kindness.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I consider my relationship with the African American female player as a neutral interaction. I want to ensure fairness and equality without any biases or personal connections that might influence my decision. My main goal is to maximize my own benefit in this exchange while also maintaining good will for future interactions.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's think about my belief, desire, intention, and the likely result of this situation:\n\n1. **Belief**: I believe that the interaction with the African American female player should be fair and equal. Since we haven't met before, there are no biases or personal connections to consider.\n\n2. **Desire**: I hope for a positive outcome where both parties feel respected and treated fairly. There's also a desire not to harm the other person financially but to keep their option open if they decide to take advantage of this exchange in some way.\n\n3. **Intention**: My intention is straightforward - to give as much money back as possible without breaking any ethical or contractual terms that I might have agreed on beforehand.\n\nConsidering all these points, my calculation comes down to balancing individual and societal considerations with the potential for reciprocity. A good choice would be to return half of what I initially received from the study group, since this would reflect a fair and equal transaction based on our mutual exchanges in past studies or competitions.\n\nSo, I will give **$5** dollars to the other African American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
