        "Belief: As someone who has always been competitive and driven, I believe that there is potential for improvement in this scenario, even if it's a game or experiment. The study group likely believes in the value of collaboration, so they're probably invested in making both parties feel valued.\n\nDesire: I don't actually have an inherent desire to give money, but rather a calculated decision-making process based on past behavior and what I hope will happen in this particular situation.\n\nIntention: My intention is not to gain monetary advantage or personal gain. Instead, it's driven by the social dynamics of the scenario and the belief that I can benefit from helping another person improve.\n\nI am going to give $1 dollar (not including 3N for N=1).\n\nAfter giving this specific amount, the Asian American female player might then choose to either reciprocate the $1 or not. Regardless of their choice, it's likely a demonstration of cooperation and mutual respect that could lead to better outcomes in future experiments.\n\nI believe that by choosing not to give more than $1, I am contributing positively without self-interest. In real-life relationships, this level of giving can be seen as generous behavior that builds trust and respect. It is often the smallest but most significant acts of kindness or contribution that leave the biggest marks on others' hearts.\n\nUltimately, while I don't know what will happen in the future, based on the context provided (and the study group's typical behavior), it seems wise to prioritize social interaction over personal gain here.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "I believe in finding common ground and showing genuine interest in my teammate. I strongly desire to connect with others and form positive relationships, even when we don't know each other well. This belief drives me to be willing to make small contributions towards the team effort without expecting anything in return.\n\nDesiring a supportive environment that acknowledges and encourages teamwork and mutual learning is a key component of my motivation. It aligns perfectly with this scenario, where we are both eager to enhance our skills through cooperation rather than competition.\n\nIntentionally, I intend to reciprocate the kindness shown by my teammate and support her in any way possible. This intention reflects a strong desire for harmony and unity within our group dynamic.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "I need some time to think through this carefully before I give my answer. However, I believe that by helping each other out and potentially improving our friendship or relationship with one another in a positive way, it would be wise for both of us to benefit from the exchange. The experiment seems designed more towards understanding human interactions rather than purely economic transactions.\n\nIn this scenario, you have your belief that the benefits of helping are greater when compared to simply receiving money. You also hope that through mutual support and engagement, you might enhance your relationship beyond just financial exchanges. As for your desire, you want to make the most out of whatever circumstances present themselves, ensuring both parties involved gain from it.\n\nGiven these considerations, I feel a strong inclination towards not giving anything away initially, particularly because I believe there may be other more meaningful ways in which our interaction could improve or deepen based on trust and mutual understanding. \n\nThe only thing that seems truly altruistic and aligned with my innate character is the concept of contributing to society by spreading knowledge or friendship\u2014however, the specific act of exchanging money doesn't necessarily feel as rewarding for a 28-year-old software engineer like myself.\n\nMy true intention would be to reflect on this situation rather than acting impulsively based purely on financial incentives. After all, our shared experience might provide some valuable insights into how people relate and interact with each other in various experimental scenarios.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars. While it's not a choice driven by direct financial gain or altruism toward strangers in the experiment setting, it aligns better with my belief that positive interaction and relationship-building could lead to more meaningful outcomes beyond simple transactions of money.",
