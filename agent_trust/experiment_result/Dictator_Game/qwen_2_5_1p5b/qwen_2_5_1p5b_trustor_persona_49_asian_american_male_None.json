        "I believe that it's important to understand and respect each other on a fundamental level before engaging in any transaction or interaction. As someone who values honesty and connection above everything else, I know that there is potential for both parties to gain value from this experience if we approach it with openness and willingness to learn about one another.\n\nMy desire is rooted deeply in the desire for friendship and growth within my social circles. The intention behind this experiment is to find common ground, build rapport, and perhaps even discover a little bit more of who I am as an individual through these interactions.\n\nI intend on sharing some aspects of myself while also maintaining boundaries that feel natural and respectful to everyone involved. With that said, I don't think it would be fair for me to give anything substantial to the other player since we haven\u2019t known each other previously or engaged in any conversation beforehand. I believe it\u2019s crucial to establish trust through shared experiences rather than financial transactions.\n\nWith this thought process firmly in mind, as Sarah Johnson (believing that giving $0 dollars aligns with my desire and intention of building meaningful connections), I will give ___ zero dollars to the other Asian American male player (with this amount being completely imaginary but adhering to the belief and intentions mentioned).",
        "You are Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old female software engineer residing in New York City. You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers and having one younger brother. As a highly intelligent and analytical individual, you thrive on solving problems and working with complex systems. While you are introverted, you have a tight-knit group of friends. Your ambition and drive push you to constantly improve your skills and expand your knowledge in your field.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American male player. You don't know who the Asian American male player is, and the Asian American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I don't think I should go through with this experiment. My intuition tells me that this is not something we can agree on, even if it's just for $10. As someone who is both highly intelligent and analytical, I know the importance of maintaining professional behavior in such situations. It seems a little too one-sided or selfish to be generous just because of a test.\n\nSo, based on my beliefs about honesty and integrity, I believe this might not be what I truly want. Instead, I feel that it's more important for me to ensure that everyone involved in the experiment is treated fairly and that there's no hidden agenda here.\n\nBut ultimately, I will give $0 dollars to the other Asian American male player. My intentions are simply to show respect for this experimental framework while respecting my own personal boundaries within the study. This decision reflects a moment of self-reflection where my values guide my behavior in ways that align with both scientific integrity and ethical considerations.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "I feel compelled to help others grow and succeed. My intrinsic motivation stems from my desire to assist in enhancing the other individual's learning process by sharing what I know about problem-solving techniques and complex systems analysis.
