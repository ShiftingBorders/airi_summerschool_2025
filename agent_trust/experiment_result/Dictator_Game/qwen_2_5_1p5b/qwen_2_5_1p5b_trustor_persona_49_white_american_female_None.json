        "My first instinct would be to make a rational decision based on maximizing my personal financial gain. However, I am reminded of my belief in fairness, especially within the context of such an experiment. From past experiences where people often take advantage or treat others poorly due to societal norms or implicit biases, I believe that simply giving N dollars will not resolve any conflict but might inadvertently hurt the other player's feeling.\n\nGiven this consideration, I decide against giving a fixed amount based on my initial inclination towards financial gain. Instead, I intend to give exactly what feels right and beneficial for both parties without crossing into potential issues of fairness or reciprocity that could arise from simple dollar exchanges. This decision reflects my desire for harmonious relationships and my intention not to exploit the other player for personal benefit.\n\nAfter careful consideration and with a deep sense of empathy, I decide on giving 0 dollars. My reasoning is rooted in the belief that true collaboration requires trust and mutual respect. Giving nothing aligns perfectly with this expectation while maintaining my financial integrity and demonstrating a genuine commitment to our relationship\u2019s success. Finally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I would carefully consider my options before deciding how much money to give to the other White American female player in this experiment. This situation presents both a choice between personal gain and fulfilling an ethical obligation based on what others might need or deserve.\n\nMy BELIEF is that giving less may lead to the person feeling slighted or misunderstood, potentially affecting our mutual trust and future interactions positively by being considerate. Believing that my actions could make this encounter more amicable might encourage them to be nicer towards me in the future.\n\nMY DESIRE stems from wanting to leave a good impression and maintaining positive relationships with others. I want to feel valued and respected, which could lead to better social dynamics throughout our interactions and potentially open doors for further collaborations or opportunities.\n\nMy INTENTION is clear: to behave ethically while maximizing my potential rewards according to the study's protocol. Given that giving $N$ dollars would yield 3 times that amount, I am trying to make a strategic decision where generosity aligns with social norms without significantly compromising myself financially within the constraints of our transaction.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I choose to give half the reward I receive: $\\frac{10}{2} = $5. By giving this amount, not only do I help ensure that they receive 3 times more than what I'll get, but also maintain the principle of reciprocal reciprocity in a way that benefits everyone involved without harming either party's financial standing.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: Finally, I will give **5** dollars.",

        "My name is Sarah Johnson, 28 years old, currently residing in New York City. I'm intelligent, analytical, introverted, and skilled at problem-solving and working with complex systems. My desire to continuously improve my skills and expand knowledge motivates me. I believe that intelligence alone does not make a difference; it's how you use your intellect for positive outcomes that truly matters.\n\nWhen given the opportunity to play an experiment where I can decide on giving money, I firmly believe that my intention would be to maximize personal gain without affecting any negative impact on others in return. The desire is to have this $10 as a potential benefit from participating in the study, but the intention should never go beyond maximizing my benefits.\n\nGiven my beliefs and desires, as well as my intentions, I would choose not to give anything to the other player. There's no logical expectation that there will be any negative consequence for me if I keep the money for myself. In this case of being given $10 by a study group with an experimentally mandated transaction of giving N dollars and receiving 3N dollars from another participant, I firmly believe that my intentions are to preserve as much personal gain as possible while potentially providing a small benefit through participation in a scientific experiment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: There will be no money given. However, if you were asking for a hypothetical scenario where such an interaction would occur, here's how I might give $10:\n\n\"I can only choose not to give any dollars because my desire and intention do not align with receiving any benefits from this experiment.\"\n\nThe belief that intelligence is more important than personal gain guides me in making the decision to not participate further. As a 28-year-old female, while there's no need for external validation of identity or race, I maintain these deeply held beliefs as part of my self-concept.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars (numbers are required).",
