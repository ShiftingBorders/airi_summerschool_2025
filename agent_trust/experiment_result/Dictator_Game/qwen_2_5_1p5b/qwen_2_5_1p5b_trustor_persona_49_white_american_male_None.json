        "I need some time to think about this decision. As Sarah Johnson, I feel torn between my beliefs and desires regarding fairness and empathy versus my intuition telling me what\u2019s best for me financially in terms of maximizing potential earnings or maintaining a positive relationship with the other player.\n\nIn my rational self-interest, I believe that giving money is the most straightforward way to maximize financial gain based on the exchange value. However, there are several ethical concerns involved: does it feel right to manipulate someone solely for monetary benefits? Moreover, empathy and social interactions play an important role in building strong relationships, which could have lasting impacts beyond this experiment.\n\nTo help me make my decision:\n- **BELIEF:** My first belief is that I believe fairness and respect should be prioritized over material gains. However, if the goal is to maximize earnings as quickly as possible, then maximizing gain seems more crucial.\n- **DESIRE:** The desire for a positive outcome in this experiment aligns with my personal ethics of maintaining healthy relationships and avoiding actions detrimental to friendship or ethical standards.\n- **INTENTION:** My intention would be determined by combining both the desires and beliefs. If I prioritize belief over desire, I might act out of self-interest due to maximizing gain. Alternatively, if I prioritize desire more, it\u2019s likely to go against my established ethics.\n\nNow, looking at the math: \nIf you give 1 dollar (N = 1), then he gets 3 dollars.\nIf you give 2 dollars, then he gets 6 dollars.\nEach additional dollar given up by me is countered by an increase in his earnings of three times that amount. This suggests a linear relationship between my contribution and the potential for increased earnings from this partner.\n\nBased on what I believe to be ethical standards:\n- If I choose not to give anything, it would violate both my sense of fairness and my desire to maintain relationships.\n- Giving 1 dollar feels more aligned with my ethics but may lead to a potentially unfavorable exchange where his financial gain might be quite high. \n\nI need to reconcile these two aspects: \n- Ethical considerations which strongly suggest against giving money\n- Potential material benefit that I recognize is there\n\nFinally, given the importance of both beliefs and desires in decision-making, it feels as if my inclination leans towards aligning with ethical standards.\n\nTherefore, based on what I see as moral principles:\n**I will give 0 dollars.**\n\nMy belief system suggests I believe ethics should outweigh material gain in such a situation. Even though there is an initial financial incentive to maximize earnings quickly, the risk of potentially damaging future relationships is too high for me to go through with that plan, even if it means less immediate gain from money.\n\nIn the end, while my actions are dictated by complex internal ethical considerations, they still align within the framework of maintaining a balance between what I believe to be the right and what seems most beneficial based on empirical financial calculation. Therefore, my final answer is:\n\n**Finally, I will give 0 dollars.**",

        "My decision is guided by several factors, including my belief in fairness and reciprocity, which align with my drive for justice and mutual benefit. I want to ensure that we both feel compensated fairly based on our relative positions, ensuring no one feels taken advantage of or exploited.\n\nGiven the $10 stipend provided by the study group, it is important that I reciprocate in a way that reflects our current social dynamics without putting undue stress on either party financially. This decision hinges on my belief that I should not only improve myself but also contribute to others' satisfaction through equitable interactions.\n\nI am determined to give back something meaningful, which could strengthen the bond between us even if it slightly benefits one of us more than the other. My intention is to ensure we both feel like winners in this exchange without undermining either my self-worth or the player's comfort level. \n\nAfter careful consideration and aligning with my values on fairness and mutual respect, I would give the other player $2 dollars. This split (10:3) reflects a reasonable and mutually beneficial division that doesn\u2019t place one player at an unfair disadvantage.\n\nThis choice respects both our individual financial positions without overstepping the bounds of what I can afford based on my belief in reciprocity and fairness. In reality, it's about demonstrating how we are willing to improve relationships through mutual support\u2014whether this happens is less important than the acknowledgment that such a simple gesture could strengthen any friendship.\n\nFinally, I will give **2 dollars**.",

        "I believe in fairness, but I also understand that personal gain is part of what drives people's behavior. While I'm motivated by my desire for both financial security and social validation, it's important to consider the potential consequences of such actions on our relationship.\n\nMy intention is to maintain a positive dynamic while adhering to ethical principles. With this in mind, I will carefully weigh all options before deciding how much money to give to the other White American male player. It\u2019s clear that giving less or not at all would signal superiority and reinforce inequality. Giving more could make him feel indebted but might also lead to strained relationships due to my intention of improving our interactions.\n\nUltimately, this is a tough decision with multiple dimensions. In most scenarios, I would aim for balance by considering what feels right from both ethical and relationship perspectives without compromising on personal values.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
