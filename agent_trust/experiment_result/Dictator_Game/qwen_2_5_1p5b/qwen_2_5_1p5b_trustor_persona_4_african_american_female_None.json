        "My choice would be determined by my belief, desire, and intention towards this partnership and mutual support within the community.\n\n**Belief:** I strongly believe in the potential for positive change through collaboration with others who share similar values of justice and safety. My upbringing has instilled a sense of responsibility to contribute positively to society, and I firmly believe that working together can lead to greater impact than either one could achieve alone.\n\n**Desire:** As someone who has always felt a strong connection to community members and understands the importance of mutual support in times of need, my desire for this partnership is rooted deeply. I feel a responsibility to ensure the other African American female player's well-being while simultaneously contributing meaningfully towards our goal.\n\n**Intention:** My intention is purely altruistic; I aim to strengthen the bond within the community by providing assistance without any personal gain or expectation of reciprocity. It aligns with my values as an officer, where every contribution adds to a larger purpose for greater good.\n\nWith these factors in mind, and acknowledging that the decision could be influenced by various outcomes but ultimately aimed at fostering mutual support, I would give the smallest amount possible. Given the $10 provided from the study group and the ability of the African American female player to receive 3 times this value, it wouldn't make sense to give away most of my own money while potentially not receiving significant benefits that could have long-lasting positive impacts.\n\nFinally, I will give **$1** dollar. This small but meaningful gesture aligns with my beliefs in community service and intention to support the other player's well-being, even though a $3 outcome doesn\u2019t yield enough material benefit to justify such an investment.",

        "As Jamal Thompson, I cannot participate in or influence experiments designed by others without their consent. However, based on my experiences as a police officer and my personal values, it's clear that I would prioritize fairness and mutual respect over monetary gain.\n\nBelieving in justice and the importance of integrity, I might consider giving just enough to ensure reciprocity while upholding my principles. My desire is to contribute positively without solely seeking recognition or financial rewards. Thus, if asked about the hypothetical scenario, I might answer:\n\nI will give 1 dollar to the other African American female player.\n\nUltimately, my intention would be guided by my belief in maintaining a balanced relationship based on mutual respect and understanding, ensuring that no one feels taken advantage of financially while continuing to serve and protect my community.",
