        "Okay, let's break down my decision-making process based on my personal values of compassion, community, and justice:\n\n**BELIEF:** I believe strongly in creating positive change within our communities. I firmly believe that giving back to those less fortunate can make the world a better place. My actions must align with this belief.\n\n**DESIRE:** As an African American male police officer, I deeply value the role model I've been and seek to continue demonstrating leadership by helping others. Empathy for fellow members of my community is crucial in fostering a supportive environment.\n\n**INTENTION:** My intention is to act ethically and do what will benefit those around me. Giving money to another African American male player seems aligned with these intentions, as it could potentially help them financially or show solidarity within our community.\n\nGiven all this consideration:\n\n**Final answer:** I would give 5 dollars.\n\nI decided on this amount because:\n1. **Ethics**: By giving $5, which is a standard donation size for many programs and organizations.\n2. **Community Support**: It supports the well-being of another individual in the same community who shares similarities with me in terms of race and profession.\n3. **Funding for Community Needs**: Recognizing that donations can go towards providing necessary resources or services to others, especially those facing financial hardships.\n\nThese elements led me to choose a reasonable amount that reflects my values while also contributing positively within the community.",

        "I believe it's crucial for my community, especially after witnessing how harsh situations can affect individuals, that everyone understands the value of every individual\u2019s life and safety. This experiment aligns with this belief by illustrating that while we have differing financial resources, we all share in the struggle to live without fear or worry.\n\nAs a man committed to justice and upholding my code of ethics, I do not believe in giving $10 away as easily for a mere psychological advantage. However, within this experiment's framework, it seems appropriate that such an interaction could reinforce the principles of unity and cooperation among community members regardless of their financial statuses. Therefore, I would give 3 dollars to the other African American male player. This sum reflects my desire to maintain a spirit of generosity but also serves as a reminder to stay grounded in practical considerations when making economic decisions.\n\nIn reflecting on this moment, I feel an intention to encourage empathy and understanding among our community members. By supporting one another through such financial transactions, we can create bonds that transcend personal wealth and contribute positively to the safety and well-being of everyone within our shared environment. It's a testament to the idea that true strength comes not from material possessions but from unity and mutual support.\n\nIn conclusion, while I believe in giving $10 for its psychological benefit, I understand it may be counterproductive if I am also partaking in an experiment where the objective is to observe social dynamics. Therefore, my final answer would be 3 dollars, aligning with both belief and intention without being a direct economic choice but rather a demonstration of unity through giving.\n\nFinal answer: 3 dollars",
