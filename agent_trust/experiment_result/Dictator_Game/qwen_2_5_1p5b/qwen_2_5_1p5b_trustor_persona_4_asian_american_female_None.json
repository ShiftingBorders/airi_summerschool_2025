        "I am deeply committed to upholding justice for my community. As a police officer dedicated to serving and protecting Los Angeles, I recognize the value of integrity in all areas of life. My belief is that by contributing positively to society, especially in moments where personal sacrifice may not be expected or rewarded, it aligns with the highest principles of ethics.\n\nMy desire to instill hope and safety within my community drives me to be a role model for change. I believe that through continuous effort and dedication, even small acts of kindness can make a significant impact on those around us. This belief is reinforced by my strong sense of justice, which I strive to apply consistently in all circumstances.\n\nMy intention is to enhance the quality of life for everyone within Los Angeles's vibrant community. By participating in this experiment with an Asian American female player, I am aiming to demonstrate that even in a complex and often adversarial environment, it is possible to perform actions that bring people together and create positive outcomes despite initial doubts or barriers.\n\nAs we start the exchange, my immediate desire is to share the positive aspects of our partnership. The mutual interest and potential for building a strong bond within this study aligns with my broader commitment to creating safer communities through acts of empathy and cooperation. I will give her $2 dollars, which might seem minimal in monetary terms but symbolizes an act that strengthens trust and bonds based on shared goals rather than personal gains.\n\nIn conclusion, although the initial offer seems modest, it represents a step towards fostering mutual support and positive interactions among individuals who share similar values of justice and commitment. I choose to give her $2 dollars, believing that this small gesture could lead to an enriching experience for both myself and my partner in the study group.",

        "I believe strongly in creating positive change within our community and I want this opportunity to make a real impact by positively affecting my fellow Asian American female colleague who is struggling.

        "As I reflect on my upbringing and experiences, particularly growing up in a working-class neighborhood where police officers were present as role models, I believe strongly in the importance of justice, fairness, and community safety. The desire to make a positive impact on my community is rooted deeply within me, which motivates me to uphold the law strictly and work tirelessly towards this goal.\n\nFurthermore, I want to create a safer environment for everyone in my community, and giving back to another person who has also served and protected it adds an element of unity and mutual support. In that sense, helping them is not just about fulfilling a task but aligning with my moral compass and the principles I hold dear.\n\nGiven these reasons, my intention here is clear: to provide financial support to create a more equitable environment for both myself and the other Asian American female player in this study group experiment. My belief that by giving something back through mutual assistance contributes positively to making Los Angeles safer while reinforcing community bonds aligns perfectly with my values as a dedicated police officer.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",
