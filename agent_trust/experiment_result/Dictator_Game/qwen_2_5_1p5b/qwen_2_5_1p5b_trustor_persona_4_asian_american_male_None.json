The experiment presented an opportunity where we could show genuine care for one another beyond mere monetary exchanges. \n\nIn considering what is best for the future and maintaining positive interactions within the study group, I decide to allocate my money towards something that benefits them as much as possible without going overboard with large sums or excessive generosity that might make us look unsuitable candidates.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollar.",

        "As Jamal Thompson, my answer would revolve around my ethical principles and moral compass when faced with this dilemma. I firmly believe in upholding justice, regardless of personal gain. Given that I am part of an experiment designed to understand social dynamics between different groups, it is crucial to approach the situation with integrity and a genuine concern for the well-being of the individuals involved.\n\nIn my experience, as someone deeply rooted in community values, fairness is paramount. The Asian American male player likely shares similar interests and goals\u2014safety and justice within his or her community. In this experiment, I would prioritize not only personal gain but also the broader ethical outcome that could be beneficial to all participants. Therefore, while the thought of receiving $10 would typically incentivize me to make a generous contribution, my belief in fairness dictates that such generosity should extend beyond what is expected from the system.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is difficult for me to quantify an exact amount to give without knowing the Asian American male player's perspective. However, I can articulate that the decision rests on a balance of empathy, integrity, and community support. I would feel compelled to give some portion of the $10, acknowledging my place in society and understanding that the contributions made by all participants could collectively have a significant impact.\n\nTo sum up: I cannot specify an exact dollar amount at this time due to the need for discretion and respect towards personal boundaries within the context of the experiment. Yet, it is clear from my principles that while I would likely give some portion (likely less than $10) as part of the experiment's design intention to enhance cooperation and understanding among participants.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",

        "As Jamal Thompson, a dedicated police officer with strong ethical principles and a commitment to community safety, I don't find this situation straightforward enough to make a significant decision solely based on dollar amounts or personal gains. While the thought of potentially gaining $10 might seem appealing in an experiment designed for scientific purposes, my primary motivations go beyond money.\n\nMy decision-making process would likely be guided by a few key elements:  \n1. Ethical Integrity - Ensuring that any actions I take align with my beliefs and principles as a police officer.\n2. Respect for Others \u2013 Treating the other person with respect, even in a hypothetical scenario where one might feel obligated to help financially out of a sense of obligation.\n3. Desire To Make A Positive Impact - The desire to influence positive change in the community despite being part of an experiment.\n\nBased on these considerations, my intention would be to give as little as possible, which is likely 1 dollar from $10, considering that I want to keep the situation professional and ethical. While there could potentially be a momentary impulse towards giving more due to the novelty or desire for immediate reciprocity, the underlying intent of such an action aligns with maintaining trust and respect in all interactions.\n\nIn reality, as Jamal Thompson, my ultimate decision would involve reflecting on my values and intentions behind this choice. However, in the context provided by this experiment without actual knowledge or input from the study group participants, the answer to how much I would give is:\n\nI will give 0 dollars.",
