        "I believe strongly in fairness and equity, especially within my community. I value equality and justice, which are fundamental principles I aim to uphold through my actions. It is important for me to contribute positively and help others understand the value of making good decisions based on mutual respect and fairness.\n\nTo feel comfortable with this situation and ensuring it does not negatively impact anyone's future outcomes or trust within our group, a key part of my belief system dictates that I should do what feels most ethically right. Given these values, my initial desire is to perform an action that promotes positive relationships rather than personal gain. However, the potential for reciprocation also factors into this decision, so it cannot be solely based on empathy or fairness.\n\nUltimately, after considering both the ethical dilemma and the reciprocity factor, I believe it would be best for my intentions to reflect what will lead to the highest degree of mutual benefit without jeopardizing the trust required to maintain such interactions in the future. Given that giving $10 back aligns more closely with an intention of helping create a positive impact rather than solely for monetary gain, and knowing that reciprocation is plausible but would also potentially lead to challenges in building and maintaining relationships over time.\n\nGiven these considerations, my final intention remains focused on ensuring the best outcome based on ethical fairness. My desire to uphold justice as reflected by this situation suggests I am committed not to exploit any individual's vulnerability or gain an unfair advantage for myself. Therefore, I aim to return a fair portion of what would otherwise be given in order to maintain balance and trust within our community.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "I want to make sure that this arrangement is fair for both of us and will not affect my role in the community or any ethical considerations I have regarding law enforcement and justice. From a societal perspective, it's important to uphold fairness and transparency, but at the same time, I believe that giving money can potentially benefit certain individuals more because they may struggle financially. \n\nReflecting on this situation from a moral standpoint, I feel compelled to balance my desire for individual gain with my commitment to upholding ethical standards in law enforcement. This aligns with my belief system and code of ethics which emphasizes honesty, integrity, and maintaining the highest professional conduct.\n\nTherefore, despite the potential impact on individuals' financial situations, it is crucial that such interactions be handled respectfully and transparently. It's essential for me to maintain public trust as an officer who upholds justice and protects community safety. This includes being mindful of how my actions might influence others and ensuring they are not taken advantage of.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe in prioritizing fairness within the boundaries of ethical considerations. While it is possible that some individuals could benefit more from this arrangement, such outcomes should ideally occur naturally as a result of societal needs rather than through strategic decision-making aimed solely at personal financial gain. This approach respects the diverse circumstances and aspirations of people involved without exploiting any vulnerabilities or inequalities.\n\nTherefore, I will give **$10** to the other White American female player.",

        "My belief is firmly rooted in my conviction of contributing positively to society. I believe in upholding justice and protecting individuals who may not be able to protect themselves due to circumstances or lack of resources. As someone deeply influenced by the values instilled in me since childhood, I strive to live an exemplary life that benefits those around me.\n\nMy desire is straightforward\u2014serving my community with dedication and professionalism. It's important to me that every citizen feels secure knowing there are police officers like me dedicated to making a difference. This motivation compels me to think carefully about the next move in this experiment. \n\nUnderstanding that this could be an opportunity to make a positive contribution, even in a seemingly trivial act such as doling out money, it is essential for me to consider the ethical implications and the impact on both parties involved.\n\nI know from personal experience that financial decisions can have unintended consequences. In my work, I am trained to avoid transactions that might undermine trust or create an atmosphere of mistrust between individuals, even in a small way like this one. My intention is to show respect for others' boundaries while simultaneously promoting community spirit and ethical engagement.\n\nAfter careful consideration of these factors, it feels right to err on the side of generosity\u2014something I've often done with my friends and family. There's an old adage that says 'If someone asks you to help them, always lend a helping hand.' This sentiment resonates deeply within me.\n\nIn conclusion, as I am both committed and conscientious in upholding moral principles and ethics, I choose to give the other player 1 dollar from my $10 allowance. Finally, I will give ___ dollars (3).",
