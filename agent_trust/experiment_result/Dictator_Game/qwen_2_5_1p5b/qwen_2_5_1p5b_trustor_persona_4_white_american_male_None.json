        "As Jamal Thompson, with my strong sense of justice and commitment to protecting our community, I would likely not participate in any experiment that seeks to exploit racial dynamics or reinforce harmful stereotypes. However, for this hypothetical situation where I am paired with another White American male player and given the ability to influence their outcome, it's important to consider my personal beliefs and desires.\n\nMy desire is to maintain a safe environment for all members of our community without exploiting anyone or creating unnecessary division between individuals based on race. The fact that I would want to participate in such an experiment and contribute $10 (3N if I give N dollars) suggests that within my ethical framework, the impact outweighs any personal gain.\n\nGiven this consideration, I will choose a generous but still honest approach to ensure both parties are treated fairly. I would give 5 dollars to the other player because it balances the need for fairness and maintains my integrity as an officer committed to upholding justice in our community. This amount also shows that I'm not overly concerned with personal gain while ensuring the experiment's results can be analyzed safely.\n\nFinally, I will give **5** dollars.",

        "I firmly believe that fairness is of paramount importance in any situation involving personal gain or loss. As a law enforcement officer who values justice above all else, I strive to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. My desire to uphold the law and protect my community aligns perfectly with my intention to ensure that both parties receive an equal opportunity.\n\nThe desire to create a safer environment for our communities has been ingrained in me from the very beginning of my life. Seeing firsthand how crime can devastate families and disrupt lives is something I will never forget, and it motivates me every day to do more. In this experiment, while knowing we are partaking in an academic study, the moral dilemma seems less about money and more about integrity.\n\nThe intention behind giving a certain amount of dollars could be considered by others as purely selfish or pragmatic. Yet for myself, I am not solely concerned with my financial situation; it's about making right choices based on principles that guide me every day in how to treat people around me.\n\nNow, considering the ethical implications and the desire for fairness, I believe giving an equal amount of money - $10 - would be the most just action. This choice is not solely motivated by a concern for personal gain or loss but rather a commitment to creating an environment where both parties are treated fairly, as prescribed in my sense of justice.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "As Jamal Thompson, I would give nothing to this other White American male player. As someone who has grown up in a community heavily influenced by the police and healthcare professions, I am deeply committed to using my position of influence responsibly. While giving anything could potentially seem like an act of kindness or solidarity on paper, it is crucial that we consider the context. In a scenario where there are two groups of people both working towards a positive goal\u2014presumably trying to make Los Angeles safer\u2014it would be counterproductive to exacerbate tensions by creating another division within our community.\n\nMy intentions here reflect the importance I place on maintaining composure and avoiding actions that could be misinterpreted as favoritism or prejudice. Given my desire to maintain a sense of fairness both in terms of personal integrity and broader societal understanding, it is likely that I would choose not to contribute anything to this arrangement. It\u2019s important to remember that our choices often reflect the values we hold dear, including but not limited to empathy, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to community support. My belief is rooted in a strong sense of justice and ethics that guides my decisions, regardless of the potential immediate results.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
