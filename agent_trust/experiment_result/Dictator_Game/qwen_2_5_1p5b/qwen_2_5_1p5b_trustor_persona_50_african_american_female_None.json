        "As Jamal Patel, it's important for me to approach this situation with sensitivity and understanding of how my personal background might influence my actions. I know the experiment is designed to explore unconscious bias based on race. For ethical reasons and because of my compassionate nature, as well as respecting privacy, I believe I have a moral obligation not to contribute any money at all.\n\nGiven that my parents came from India and I have been part of this country for many years, I also feel a strong desire to integrate and respect the cultural fabric of my community. This includes appreciating diversity and being inclusive, which could be mistaken as sympathy towards others or a belief in them receiving undeserved help.\n\nI believe in acting with integrity and fairness. The experiment's purpose is not just about providing financial rewards but to observe how different social perceptions influence behavior and interactions. I want to avoid perpetuating any potential biases that may arise from the interaction.\n\nTherefore, my intention behind this action is to show respect for others' opinions, understanding of racial dynamics in America, and a commitment towards being unbiased and respectful to all individuals involved. \n\nUltimately, **I will give 0 dollars**.",

        "Before I answer this question, let's first address your request about keeping the identity as Jamal Patel, which is valid within the context of the experiment or scenario. However, it\u2019s important to reflect on how such an experiment might impact people based on their race and cultural background.\n\nGiven the circumstances you\u2019ve described, my initial reaction might lead me to consider a more traditional approach that would likely maximize the monetary outcome for myself, especially considering the potential consequences of giving significant sums without being aware of its nature. As a person known for being compassionate and caring, I might prioritize this over strictly maximizing financial gain.\n\nHowever, when thinking about your request specifically to include content related to beliefs, desires, intentions, it highlights the psychological component that often influences decision-making in situations like these. In my belief system as Jamal Patel, compassion is deeply ingrained, so while there\u2019s a potential for monetary benefit, I might lean more towards maximizing my personal well-being and emotional health by giving a smaller amount.\n\nGiven this nuanced consideration:\n\n### Belief\n- **Compassion**: My first inclination would be to give some amount but likely less than the maximum.\n- **Respect for the other person's choice**: The desire to show respect might prompt me to choose not to participate in the exchange at all, avoiding any potential conflict or judgment.\n\n### Desire\n- As a human being, I have an inherent urge to connect and share with others. However, my desire is guided by the recognition that direct interaction can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts.\n\n### Intention\n- In terms of intent, I might intend to give $0 because:\n  - It\u2019s in line with respecting the other person.\n  - There would likely be no immediate financial reward for me if we decide against exchanging money.\n  - The act of giving $1 could potentially foster a positive interaction that benefits us both.\n\nConsidering these factors and keeping them as part of my answer, I will give **$0**.",

        "Oh dear, this situation is far from what I intended. The experiment was designed with good intentions to measure our interactions under different circumstances, but let's consider your own values in how we proceed.\n\nFirstly, the intention behind giving money without knowing whom you're doing it for or why is crucial. This could be seen as a form of respect and connection beyond mere material exchanges, even if the other person doesn't reciprocate. \n\nIn my belief system, I strive to treat every human being with kindness and dignity because that's part of being compassionate and caring. Giving without expecting anything back could also indicate a desire for genuine connections rather than immediate returns.\n\nMy intention is simply to ensure that both parties receive something meaningful from the interaction, which could positively influence our relationship in ways beyond just money transactions.\n\nTaking into account all these considerations, I find it most aligned with my values and intentions to give $5 to the other African American female player. This isn't an automatic or calculated decision based on statistics; rather, it's about the respect for her, a small gesture towards connection, and potentially positive outcomes beyond material gain.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
