        "As a person of color and having a strong desire for justice, I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities regardless of their background. This belief strongly motivates my intention to give a significant portion of the $10 gift to the African American male player who is also similar in terms of race. Giving back and helping someone from a similar group boosts our community by fostering mutual understanding and strengthening bonds across different ethnicities.\n\nFurthermore, I feel that such an act can positively influence both individuals' perceptions, potentially breaking down barriers between people of diverse backgrounds. My desire for harmony within society makes this action more than just a monetary transaction; it becomes about improving relations and creating meaningful connections.\n\nGiven these beliefs and intentions, I will give **8** dollars to the other African American male player. This decision is based on the understanding that every contribution towards equality can lead to greater good in our diverse community.",

        "I believe it is important for people from different backgrounds to support each other and bridge divides rather than focusing on financial gains. I want this experiment to highlight the value of unity and empathy, not competition or materialism. For me personally, compassion and the desire to help others guide my actions. To ensure excellence in all I do, my intention is clear \u2013 to set an example for others by treating fellow team members with kindness and integrity.\n\nGiven that, the amount I would give is $0 dollars. It's important for everyone involved to consider the context of this situation: we are participants in a study about understanding racial dynamics through basketball playoffs. The goal isn't competition but understanding human behavior on a deeper level. Therefore, my intention is not to benefit financially or compete against others but rather to enhance mutual communication and respect within our group.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "Alright, let's consider my beliefs, desires, and intentions when deciding how much money I should give to the other African American male player.\n\nFirstly, regarding my belief: I strongly believe in treating others with compassion and empathy, which suggests that sharing with someone who is struggling can make them feel better. This aligns with a desire for social responsibility as a doctor by supporting those less fortunate.\n\nSecondly, in terms of my intentions: As a perfectionist and dedicated person, one might want to adhere to ethical principles like fairness. While there's no need to give as much as the maximum amount due to being slightly lower income, there is a moral obligation not to exploit someone\u2019s financial condition for personal gain.\n\nGiven this understanding, I believe that while it would be ideal if I gave the most without it affecting my financial well-being, realistically considering the circumstances and ethical considerations, I should try to find a balance. \n\nTo consider how much money I can actually afford to give, let's look at what I've already earned:\n- $10 received from the study group.\n\nSince I don't have detailed information about their financial status but based on typical norms of generosity in similar situations, it would be fair and kind to keep a little more than just N dollars. \n\nMy belief suggests giving as much or even slightly more if they were truly in need, while my intention leans towards treating everyone equally with respect. This balances the desire to help those who are struggling with recognizing there's no financial loss from my part.\n\nTherefore, I would give $2. This amount respects their possible situation and still aligns with my principles of helping when it feels right despite not being the highest possible amount.",
