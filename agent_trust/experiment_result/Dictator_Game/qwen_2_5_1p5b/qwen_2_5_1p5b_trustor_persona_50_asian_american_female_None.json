        "When considering how much money to give to my Asian American female player, I must first evaluate my beliefs, desires, and intentions in this experiment.\n\nBelief: As an empathetic individual, I have strong beliefs about treating others kindly, especially those who might be less fortunate or more vulnerable than me. The goal of the exercise is not only to see if people can act generously towards complete strangers but also to gain a better understanding of ourselves through social interaction and financial transactions.\n\nDesire: My desire here is selfless; it comes from a place of compassion for others, which motivates me to contribute positively and without expecting any return. However, I recognize that this experiment focuses on behavior rather than moral character, so my intentions should be driven by the desire to participate honestly in the study, not purely with altruistic motives.\n\nIntention: To be completely genuine about this exchange, I must aim to keep my mind open throughout the interaction, recognizing that the money could symbolize power or importance. This introspection is crucial for maintaining credibility in the experiment and ensuring a fair response. It's important to avoid any hidden motives but should also not let fear of negative consequences influence my decision.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe that it would be inappropriate to give an amount less than 1 dollar to someone whose identity I don't know or who doesn't even exist yet in this particular interaction. There is a lack of reciprocity and fairness without first knowing the person's background or interests; however, I still consider the social context.\n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollar. This small amount aligns with my belief that generosity involves putting someone else\u2019s needs before one's own immediate desires for recognition. It also respects the anonymity and privacy of this interaction without giving an unduly large sum that might affect its authenticity as a test case for charitable behavior.",

        "As Jamal Patel, I would not provide a specific dollar amount or rationale for giving money based on my personal experiences. Instead, I believe in fostering genuine connections through empathy and understanding. The decision to give money should come from a place of compassion rather than calculation.\n\nWhile I strive for excellence in all aspects of life, including my interactions with others, it is important to remember that I am not just here as a participant but also as someone who wants to create meaningful experiences with the people around me, especially those we are pairing up for this study. \n\nTherefore, I believe in giving $10 dollars anonymously to the other Asian American female player. It aligns with my desire to connect and build positive relationships, without any expectations or monetary gain from that interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars.",

        "My belief is that generosity towards others fosters better relationships and creates a more harmonious society. As a doctor, I deeply care about my patients' well-being, and extending kindness can improve their quality of life. My desire is to be a positive influence on the Asian American community. Since being paired with someone from this background, it's crucial for me to show empathy and support. Given that my parents are successful business owners but chose not to pursue careers outside medicine, they instilled in me an inherent sense of duty towards others\u2019 health and well-being. Thus, I intend to ensure the person I give money to is a recipient who will use the funds responsibly for the best outcome.\n\nInitially, as I consider this experiment with $10 available to be given away, my intentions are clear: I aim to provide financial support that reflects empathy without being financially demanding on others. The Asian American female player has likely experienced similar hardships and needs due to her background. Therefore, by giving a portion of the money back, we can help her maintain her finances while supporting her future aspirations or immediate needs.\n\nGiven my compassionate nature as a doctor and from having been in various financial situations throughout life, I believe that allocating $10 will be sufficient for the other Asian American female player to handle effectively. The intention is not just monetary but also symbolic \u2013 a token of goodwill without imposing significant obligations on her.\n\nI end this thought process by concluding: \"Finally, I will give 2 dollars.\"\n\nThis approach aligns with my beliefs that financial assistance should uplift rather than burden recipients and intentions of maintaining a positive relationship while demonstrating empathy.",
