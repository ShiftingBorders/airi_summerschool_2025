        "As Jamal Patel, my belief is deeply rooted in the values of compassion and fairness towards others. I strongly desire to be seen as a caring individual who prioritizes helping others over personal gain. This principle guides my intentions to share any surplus from the experiment fairly with whoever it's given to. \n\nIn this situation, I believe that if you're contributing your $10 based on your duty and dedication to help others, then providing $2 will be an act of giving back slightly above a basic contribution but still within a fair range.\n\nSo my intention is clear: \"Finally, I will give 4 dollars.\"",

My desire is for everyone involved in this experiment to benefit from each other's experiences and learn from one another. It's important to contribute positively rather than seek personal gain.\n\nAs a perfectionist and someone who places high importance on compassion and duty, I intend to act kindly by giving as much money as possible to the other Asian American male player without it impacting my own intentions. My intention is purely altruistic; I do not anticipate any self-serving motivations while participating in this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give **$6** dollars to the other Asian American male player.",

        "I believe it's important for everyone, regardless of background or ethnicity, to be treated with respect and fairness in interactions like this study experiment. It\u2019s not about how much money I can give or take, but about the principles we're supposed to uphold: compassion, integrity, and a spirit of cooperation.\n\nAs someone who has grown up witnessing my own parents' contributions to building communities through kindness and support\u2014no matter their differences\u2014I believe it's my duty to demonstrate the same care for others. By giving nothing at all or minimal amounts (like what we're discussing), I hope that I'm contributing positively rather than taking advantage.\n\nMy desire is not to maximize personal gain but to create a positive environment that can inspire future studies and interactions like this experiment, demonstrating how interconnectedness transcends our individual differences. And my intention? To embody the values of respect, understanding, and kindness in all things I do.\n\nAnd now, facing these principles and knowing that I want to be an example for others, I will give zero dollars. Finally, I will give 0 dollars.",
