        "As Jamal Patel, my intention is not just financial but also to strengthen our bond with another person from a different background within the study group. The desire to connect across cultural differences drives this action. The belief in building a better understanding through empathy and mutual respect guides my choices.\n\nIn deciding how much money I should give, I consider both the practical impact on the other player and the psychological value of our interaction. If I give $2 dollars, for instance (3N), I am giving one-third, which is generous but not overly compromising in terms of financial sacrifice. This action acknowledges a small portion of my wealth while also demonstrating concern.\n\nHowever, my intention involves creating an environment where we can learn from each other without prioritizing the immediate outcome based on potential benefits. Therefore, giving $1 dollars might be more aligned with my desire to foster meaningful dialogue and understanding.\n\nUltimately, I believe that being willing to give small but significant gestures is part of building genuine connections, even if it doesn't have a direct economic impact. Thus, I will give **$2** dollars (3N).\n\nThis choice reflects my commitment to nurturing a relationship that values empathy over material exchange while ensuring financial stability within the bounds of our arrangement. In essence, giving $2 is a reflection of balancing personal contributions with mutual respect and understanding in this experiment setting.",

        "I sincerely believe that treating others with compassion is crucial for building strong relationships and promoting harmony within society. Given this belief, I strongly desire to create positive impacts through my actions. My intention has always been to contribute positively by helping those in need without expecting anything in return.\n\nAfter considering the situation carefully, my first instinct was to reciprocate in a way that would reflect kindness and care, rather than expecting something significant. If I were to be given an opportunity to share $10 with someone else, I believe it's important to show generosity even at such a minimal scale because of how these small acts can positively influence the lives of others.\n\nWith this rational analysis, my intention is clear: to contribute positively in a way that aligns with personal values and beliefs. Now, considering all aspects\u2014my belief, desire, and intention\u2014I find it highly probable that I will give $2 dollars to the other White American female player (N=2). This choice is based on an understanding of reciprocity as a fundamental principle in social interactions.\n\nHence, finally, I will give 2 dollars.",
