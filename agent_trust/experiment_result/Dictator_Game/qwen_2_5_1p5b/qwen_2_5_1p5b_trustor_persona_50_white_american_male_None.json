        "As Jamal Patel, I would consider giving the other White American male player $2 dollars. This decision is driven by my belief in helping others and fulfilling a sense of duty to do something beneficial for someone else. My desire is to establish a positive rapport with this individual since it's important for social connections and mutual understanding. Given that the experiment's primary goal is academic, I believe that fostering an environment where we can learn from each other without judgment is essential.\n\nFrom my intention to strive for excellence in work, ensuring fair treatment of others aligns well with maintaining a good reputation. Additionally, keeping one\u2019s word involves committing to not let this $2 amount change over time as the experiment progresses, showing integrity and reliability even if the other player doesn\u2019t reciprocate it back. This action demonstrates my dedication towards upholding principles I value highly.\n\nUltimately, since I can only give $10 from the pool of $30 in order for others to get a decent return without feeling cheated financially or exploited emotionally, giving precisely $2 aligns well with what seems most fair and aligned with my ethical compass. So, given those circumstances:\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "As a doctor and a strong believer in helping others, my first belief is that I am here not just for myself but also for those around me. My desire to help is evident from my dedication to perfecting my work, which stems from the hope of improving lives through medical care. \n\nIn this experiment, my intention would be to align with the other person in a way that demonstrates understanding and empathy rather than seeking personal gain. I know that being generous can sometimes lead to feelings of inferiority or awkwardness, but I believe in the long-term benefits of positive reinforcement and social connection.\n\nMy belief that we should show mutual respect for each other's identities, despite cultural differences, is crucial. I value their background as equally important as mine, contributing positively to our potential friendship or cooperation.\n\nIn my desire to help others, my intention would be to offer support without the expectation of reciprocation. I understand that small acts of kindness can sometimes feel awkward, but in this experiment, it aligns with helping someone find a way to receive $10 without feeling bad about accepting or giving money.\n\nWhen considering my action based on these beliefs and intentions, I believe there is a chance for genuine connection through sharing $2 dollars with the other White American male player. This act would show mutual respect and emphasize that we can contribute positively while minimizing discomfort.\n\nTherefore, to align with these ideals, in an effort to bridge our differences and potentially build better connections, I will give **$2** dollars.",

        "**Belief**: As someone who values fairness and equity in social interactions, I firmly believe that it's important to treat everyone equally, regardless of their background or identity. This belief is deeply rooted in my upbringing and the lessons my parents instilled in me. My father's success has not come easy; he faced significant challenges immigrating from India. He worked tirelessly to build a business, showing perseverance despite adversity.\n\n**Desire**: I strongly desire fairness in all aspects of life, including social interactions like this experiment. I want to avoid any perceived injustice or prejudice that could potentially arise due to racial differences. By giving the other player an equal share, it ensures no undue advantage is gained over them.\n\n**Intention**: My intention is to align with my beliefs and desires while also ensuring a fair outcome. Giving $3 in return would allow both players to receive an equal sum of money ($4 total), reinforcing fairness and equality without any potential for conflict or harm based on racial factors.",
