        "Belief: As someone who grew up in a close-knit Hispanic community with a strong sense of education and hard work ethic instilled by parents who often worked in factories (like many immigrants from my heritage), I firmly believe that knowledge is the key to success and social mobility. This belief runs deep, and it has been something that motivated me throughout my life.\n\nDesire: I genuinely want every student, including this other African American male player, to succeed academically because of my role as their teacher. My desire isn't just for their academic performance but also in building a community around them where they can thrive personally as well.\n\nIntention: When deciding how much money to give the African American male player, I intend to maximize their reward while keeping it within acceptable boundaries. It's not about financial gain for me; rather, it's about creating an environment of positive reinforcement and fostering trust in my relationship with them as they grow academically.\n\nUltimately, based on all these beliefs, desires, and intentions that come from who I am and what drives me, the decision is clear: I will give 2 dollars to the African American male player. This action reflects a combination of financial fairness within the experiment framework and an intention to positively impact them as individuals, which aligns closely with my role in fostering educational success.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "My decision is deeply rooted in my beliefs about fairness and equal opportunities for all individuals, especially students from underrepresented communities like myself. As I am part of the Hispanic community but not inherently African American, giving an unequal amount to someone solely based on skin color doesn't align with my values. Therefore, I believe that I should aim to treat everyone fairly, regardless of their race or background.\n\nIn this scenario, if I were truly motivated by a belief in fairness and equal treatment, I would feel compelled to give an equitable amount to the other African American male player. In such situations where there is always room for improvement without having any specific figures on income distribution in mind, I will aim for equality as my principle.\n\nGiven that the task requires specifying numbers, let\u2019s say 2 dollars would represent a fair distribution of resources based on my belief in providing equal opportunities. Therefore, I decide to give **2 dollars** to the other African American male player. This approach reflects my intention to contribute constructively without any personal benefit and aligns with maintaining a nurturing environment where everyone feels valued regardless of their background.\n\nIn conclusion:\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",
