        "Oh no! This is quite an unexpected turn of events and I find myself caught between my strong belief in knowledge and growth, my desire to ensure mutual benefit, and my intention to instill trust in someone new. Let's explore what my choices might be.\n\nBelief: As a teacher, my first instinct would be rooted in the power we hold over our students. By sharing this wealth of $10 with them, I am giving them not just financial support but also an experience that can potentially make their college journey easier and more enjoyable.\n\nDesire: My natural desire is to contribute positively towards others and to show mutual respect. In a situation like this, it would be a display of goodwill, which could foster deeper connections between people from different backgrounds.\n\nIntention: When I look at the intention part of my decision, I realize that my primary aim here is to establish rapport with this Asian American female player. The $10 in hand seems not so much money as an opportunity to create positive interactions.\n\nTherefore, based on these three components\u2014belief, desire, and intention\u2014I believe giving $2 to her makes the most sense. This amount reflects a balance between providing tangible help while also expressing genuine interest and goodwill towards this new individual I've met through my study group.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "I firmly believe in the transformative power of knowledge for everyone, regardless of their background. I want to ensure my students see the world through new lenses, learning from diverse perspectives and experiences. This belief drives my actions, whether it's tutoring them at 42 years old or engaging with a study group about experimental research. As someone deeply committed to education and understanding, my desire is to make this moment even more meaningful for you.\n\nI am determined to give the other participant in the experiment a fair share of the $10 I received.

The intention is purely selfless\u2014providing you with access to additional knowledge and resources.\n\nI am deeply understanding and patient. This mindset guides my actions, ensuring the experiment's purpose reflects mutual growth rather than creating a hierarchy of perceived abilities. Therefore, as an attempt at community participation and equality, I believe it would be wise to give:\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",
