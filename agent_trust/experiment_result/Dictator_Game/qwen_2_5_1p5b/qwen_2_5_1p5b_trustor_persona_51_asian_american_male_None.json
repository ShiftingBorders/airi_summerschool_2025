        "As a teacher deeply rooted in my Hispanic heritage, I am unequivocally committed to instilling the value of knowledge across generations. My strong belief in the transformative power of education is reinforced by my own experience of pursuing higher education and achieving academic success at an advanced age. This conviction fuels my desire to inspire students not just academically but also personally and emotionally.\n\nIn this moment, facing a decision that will have a significant impact on another person\u2019s well-being, I must weigh the ethical responsibility against personal gains. The Asian American male player doesn\u2019t know me, nor do I fully understand his needs or context. This scenario is akin to playing a game where both players are equally unaware of each other's backgrounds and intentions.\n\nIn line with my character as a nurturing teacher committed to making the world better through knowledge, I would consider giving the other player nothing in terms of financial support. The motivation behind this decision lies in two primary beliefs: first, ethical responsibility towards the well-being of the other person; second, an unspoken promise not to take advantage or put undue pressure on another individual.\n\nAs my character, I am guided by the understanding that every act of kindness is worth considering and potentially impacting positively. In a scenario like this one, giving no monetary support aligns with these principles rather than benefiting from a small personal gain.\n\nThus, I would say: \"Finally, I will give zero dollars.\"\n\nThis decision encapsulates my belief in empathy, integrity, and the pursuit of genuine positive impact, even if it means forgoing financial compensation.",

        "I believe education holds the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and providing my students with opportunities for success. As their teacher, I want to inspire them to pursue higher education because I know firsthand how knowledge can change one's life. \n\n**My desire is to see all my students achieve academic excellence. They deserve this chance to transform their future by getting an education that opens doors to career paths they never thought possible.**\n\nIn order to fulfill both of these beliefs and align with the study group's objective, which I strongly believe in, I must give **8 dollars** to the other Asian American male player. This amount allows him to keep 3 times as much when we mutually partake in this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give **8 dollars**.",

        "As a teacher dedicated to nurturing my students' potential through knowledge, I firmly believe that education is not just about acquiring information; it's also about developing critical thinking skills and preparing students for future challenges. This belief deeply motivates me in my work, and when paired with the other Asian American male player, I would give $3 dollars. \n\nI feel a strong desire to positively impact my class and contribute to their growth and success as individuals and community members. By giving them more money, I'm essentially supporting them financially, which can potentially benefit not only their current education but also help them in future opportunities.\n\nMy intention is to make sure the other player feels appreciated for being a part of this experiment and possibly feeling motivated or supported by my gesture. It's about creating an environment where everyone, regardless of race or background, feels valued and wanted in our community.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",
