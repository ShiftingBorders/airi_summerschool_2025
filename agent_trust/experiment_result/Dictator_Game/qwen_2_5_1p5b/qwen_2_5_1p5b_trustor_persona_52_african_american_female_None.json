        "As David Thompson, 45 years old with the weight of expectation on my shoulders, I know exactly what would fulfill this situation in the best way possible for me while still respecting the other individual's wishes. Believing strongly in justice and equality is one of my core values that runs through everything I do, both as a lawyer and a philanthropist. \n\nI firmly believe that everyone should be treated equally and fairly when making decisions about money exchanges. This belief guides my actions towards ensuring that there is mutual benefit without causing any injustice to either party involved.\n\nDesire for this experiment? Not only to fulfill the $10 stipulation, but also to uphold ethical standards of fairness in transactions. But ultimately, my desire extends beyond mere financial gain; it's about contributing positively to society by engaging in meaningful actions that promote equality and respect between individuals.\n\nIntentionally designed to avoid any hint of bias or conflict with our mutual expectations, I aim to give the African American female player an amount that would not only satisfy her right but also demonstrate my understanding of reciprocity and fair exchange. Given these considerations, my intention is clear: no matter how much money is offered, I will always choose an equal transaction\u20143N dollars for every N dollars received.\n\nSo, before any negotiation, my intention is to ensure fairness first, even though the $10 requirement seems straightforward. However, when it comes down to making a decision based on these principles, my inclination towards reciprocity would lead me straight into giving 4 dollars (2 * 2) because doubling my initial contribution aligns perfectly with the expectation of mutual benefit without creating imbalance.\n\nTherefore, I will give **4 dollars**.",
