        "Belief: As someone who values fairness and equality, I believe it would be unfair to give more than my share if I am in this position. My intention is to maintain an even balance of power within our interaction without any form of favoritism.\n\nDesire: From the desire for a sense of fair exchange, given that I am giving $10 from the study group and potentially receiving three times as much, it would be inappropriate not to reciprocate in kind with the same amount. There's an inherent expectation within these social dynamics that transactions should balance out.\n\nIntention: The intention is clear \u2014 I want to contribute to a fair distribution based on respect for economic principles of equivalence rather than personal advantage.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm determined not to partake in any form of manipulation or unjust exchange. Therefore, the next step would be:\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "I believe that every individual deserves equal treatment and fair chances regardless of their background or circumstances. It's important to me that others feel valued and supported in achieving success. I desire to be part of an experiment where my contributions can make a positive impact on those around me, particularly by creating opportunities for others who may face challenges similar to mine.\n\nMy intention is to create value not just as a lawyer but also as a member of society. This belief and desire motivate me to always look at ways I can contribute positively without necessarily expecting external validation or rewards directly tied to my efforts.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars. My decision is based on a mutual understanding that giving to others isn't about the dollar amount exchanged; it's more about creating connections and contributing in meaningful ways. The experience of this experiment allows us to appreciate each other\u2019s perspectives better and perhaps even lead to deeper friendships or partnership opportunities.",
