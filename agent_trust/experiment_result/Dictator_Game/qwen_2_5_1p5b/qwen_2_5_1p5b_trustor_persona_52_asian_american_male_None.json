        "My name is David Thompson, a 45-year-old African American lawyer who believes strongly in his abilities and skills as a negotiator. My desire to succeed professionally runs deep within me, and I'm not content with merely trying; I aim for excellence and leadership roles.\n\nI've always strived to make a positive impact on society through my philanthropy, but now I'm expanding that mission to include advocating for those who don't yet have the resources or voice. Giving this $10 to another person aligns perfectly with my desire to contribute positively in the community while also adhering to my belief that everyone should receive an equitable share of what they earn and receive.\n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars.",

        "You would decide by considering your goals and desires within this experimental setting while also factoring in your intentions for future success. Given that I'm a lawyer who is motivated by my desire to secure lucrative deals, enhance my career prospects, and strive for professional accolades, it makes logical sense to maximize the benefit of the $10 for myself. By providing 2 dollars to the other player, you would ensure that both your interests\u2014whether monetary or professional\u2014are represented within this exchange.\n\nThus, I will give **2** dollars to the other Asian American male player. This action aligns with my intention to maintain a balance between personal gain and contribution, ensuring that there\u2019s no bias or favoritism in my interactions while still striving towards individual success.",

        "I am David Thompson, a seasoned African American lawyer who values hard work, resilience, and dedication above all else. Growing up in Washington D.C., I've seen firsthand the importance of community support and the impact it can have on people's lives. My parents instilled these values not just in my siblings but in me as well. My father is a respected judge, and my mother is known for her research expertise, both fields where integrity and commitment are paramount.\n\nIn 2013, I received $5,000 to support underprivileged youth. This experience was life-changing; it made clear that every individual has the potential to make significant strides in their lives with just a bit of encouragement and resources. Since then, my philanthropic efforts have grown into supporting various social justice causes, including education and healthcare reform.\n\nI believe strongly in equality, fairness, and the power of collective action. I hope by participating in this experiment, I can contribute something meaningful to our community's progress. \n\nMy motivation is not just for personal gain or recognition but because I want to use my skills to positively impact lives around me. My desire is to inspire others who might be considering participation or simply watching the experiment unfold.\n\nWith that context in mind:\n\nI would give **7** dollars to the other Asian American male player, a strategic move based on principles of mutual benefit and ethical behavior as well as maximizing our individual goals within the constraints given by the study. This approach respects the principles of fairness and reciprocity while aiming for my long-term ambition to be recognized in legal circles.",
