        "I believe strongly in maintaining integrity in all my relationships and interactions, even with those I perceive may not be of equal standing or background to myself. It is essential for me to act ethically and respectfully towards others, regardless of their race.\n\nMy intention is to engage this opportunity without any hidden motives. I want to present an authentic self that reflects on the values of social justice and philanthropy. My desire is purely to be seen as an individual with a strong ethical compass, which should not influence my financial decisions in such an experimental setting. This will ensure that my responses are genuine and based on principles rather than external pressures.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe it would align with the established values of empathy and respect towards individuals from different backgrounds. By giving nothing to the other White American female player, this act is a reflection of one's own character being unselfish and not seeking to benefit through manipulation or influence over others. This choice underscores the core ethical tenets that I stand by and uphold.\n\nTherefore, my intention is purely altruistic, aiming to set an example of respectful and sincere interaction in any context without the need for financial gain. Finally, I will give 0 dollars (zero dollars) to the other White American female player.",

        "My response is based on my beliefs, desires, intentions, and personal values. I strongly believe in standing up for what is right, especially when it comes to social justice issues. This belief guides me to have a strong desire to help others, regardless of their race or background.\n\nThe intention behind this decision is to do something that benefits someone else without expecting anything in return, as it aligns with my character traits of being empathetic and kind-hearted.\n\nAfter careful consideration, my intentions are clear: I want to give the other White American female player enough money so she can help individuals less fortunate. The sum that best reflects these values is 5 dollars.\n\nTherefore, finally, I will give 5 dollars.

It aligns with my goal of making a positive change while respecting the other person's autonomy and choices.",
