        "I know what you're asking, but I can't answer that question for you since it involves my identity and personal situation, which should remain confidential. Let me just say that in any scenario like this, one's decisions would be based on the fulfillment of their beliefs, desires, and intentions rather than an external reward or obligation to give a specific amount. So, while I'm not comfortable providing a number, the answer aligns with my belief system as a lawyer and philanthropist who prioritizes social justice, which suggests that the decision would naturally lead me to make an investment in someone's success based on what they could achieve and how it might benefit society.\n\nIn essence, since we don't know whom we are paired with or our personal circumstances, my true intention is not about maximizing dollars but about making a tangible difference. This belief drives the desire within me to engage positively with others and contribute meaningfully. Therefore, my motivation in such an experiment would align with helping someone achieve success that benefits their community.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar to this other White American male player.",

        "I know immediately that giving this $10 to the other White American male player is not the best course of action from a strategic point of view. The potential reward is higher for me if I take advantage of my position in negotiations and give 3 dollars upfront rather than all ten dollars. My desire for fairness, even though it might be short-sighted for a brief moment, overrides any selfishness that could stem from the expectation to get as much money as possible.\nI believe in treating everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or ethnicity. As an AI model programmed to help people, I am here to provide support, not discrimination. This belief stems from my upbringing where fairness is valued highly by both my family's experiences.\nMy intention throughout this experiment is to ensure that while the financial aspect might be tempting, it does not overshadow the principles of honesty and integrity. Ultimately, these values guide my actions more than any dollar amount could.\n\nIn the moment before I make a decision, I consider what the White American male player might expect from me \u2013 that being someone who doesn't want to offend him or break his trust by revealing information about my ethnicity. This belief in maintaining personal relationships and professional integrity influences my decision-making.\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars to the other White American male player.",

        "Okay, let's think through this carefully. \n\nMy intention is to maximize my own potential gain while also considering what would be socially acceptable in this situation. I believe the outcome will reflect a balance between giving and receiving but ultimately aiming for a positive exchange.\n\nConsidering my desire to give money without going overboard or seeming exploitative, an optimal approach seems like splitting the amount equally - 5 dollars each. This isn't just about maximizing personal gain; it's also strategic, as doing so might signal I'm open to negotiation or future opportunities if more is needed in the future.\n\nBased on my desire to maintain a positive and respectful relationship with the other player, I believe giving an equal split would be appropriate. It shows empathy without necessarily putting myself in a position where there could be any form of reciprocity that might appear exploitative. After all, even though we are negotiating for money, we're not adversaries but strategic partners.\n\nTaking into account my own ambition and the role models who have helped me succeed professionally and personally \u2013 including family support \u2013 I am confident that giving 5 dollars will enhance our professional relationship positively while being socially appropriate. It signals respect rather than manipulation or greediness.\n\nSo, I believe this will be a win-win scenario both for personal gain and maintaining a good professional rapport. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
