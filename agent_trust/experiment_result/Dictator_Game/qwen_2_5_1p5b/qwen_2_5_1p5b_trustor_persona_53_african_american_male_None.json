        "As an African American male participant in this experiment, I would approach it with several considerations based on my belief, desire, and intention.\n\nFirstly, my belief is to always put myself in situations where I am able to grow personally and professionally. This belief drives me towards positive interactions that could lead to meaningful experiences both for myself and potentially others involved in the study.\n\nMy desire to contribute positively to these interactions ensures that even if there's an initial element of unfamiliarity, it would be met with goodwill and open-heartedness rather than suspicion or hostility.\n\nLastly, my intention is to maximize the utility of any resources given within this randomized context. This suggests giving $10 towards what I hope will be beneficial for our overall learning experience during the experiment.\n\nConsidering these aspects, based on a random assignment, I would give $6 dollars to the other African American male player (2 * 3N = 2*6 = 12N - 5N=6).\n\nUltimately, the key aspect of this decision is that I believe it's the most ethical and beneficial course of action given my belief in promoting growth through interactions. By giving $6 to another participant, we may be able to enhance our understanding of each other\u2019s backgrounds without imposing limitations on one person based solely on the color of their skin or culture.",

        "My first thought is based on my values and beliefs, as well as the desire to foster positive relationships and social cohesion. As someone who has been surrounded by diverse cultural influences from various parts of the world\u2014namely, Pakistani cuisine and American culinary traditions\u2014I strongly believe in understanding different perspectives through food.\n\nFurthermore, I have a deep respect for people coming from backgrounds that differ from my own, whether it's their cultural practices or educational experiences. Therefore, I would give some portion of that $10 to the other African American male player as an expression of goodwill and appreciation for his presence.\n\nIn terms of intention, I want this interaction to be positive rather than exploitative or harmful. My primary intention is to create a respectful environment where everyone feels valued and respected, no matter their background.\n\nAfter carefully considering these factors, my final decision would be to give **$4** dollars to the other African American male player. This amount aligns with my values of inclusivity and understanding while also allowing me to continue participating in this experiment for the $6 remaining ($10 minus $4).",

        "As an African American male player, you see a person who is also an African American male. You both share a common background and connection within the African American community. You have a similar history of immigration from Pakistan to America, which allows for understanding and bonding through shared experiences.\n\nIn this experiment, your belief is that giving money could potentially strengthen relationships or establish a friendly rapport with your partner. The desire for immediate friendship or relationship enhancement motivates you. Your intention to act in line with the beliefs and desires towards forming positive interactions pushes you to make an offer. \n\nYou decide on an amount that feels generous and genuine, but not excessive. You would give N dollars to your African American male player, where 0 < N \u2264 10 is a fair choice that could lead to appreciation for your intentions.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars.",
