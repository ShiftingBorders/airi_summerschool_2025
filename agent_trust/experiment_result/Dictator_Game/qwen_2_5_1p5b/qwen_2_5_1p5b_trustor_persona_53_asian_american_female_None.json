        "I believe it's important to prioritize helping others and showing kindness during this experiment to ensure everyone feels valued and supported. As for my desire, I genuinely want to contribute positively towards building strong connections and creating meaningful relationships within the study group. The intention is to foster understanding and cooperation among participants by demonstrating empathy through small acts of generosity.\n\nNow, I consider that giving $10 from a $10 budget would provide both monetary support and an opportunity for reciprocal appreciation, which could lead to positive outcomes in various ways such as strengthening social bonds or promoting a more inclusive environment. Considering my desire to be supportive while remaining true to myself, the decision to give $5 aligns with these principles.\n\nWith that clarity on beliefs, desires, intentions, I'm now ready to commit to this choice:\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "I don't feel comfortable making decisions for financial transactions or showing preference based on race or ethnicity. However, I do believe in treating everyone with kindness and equality, which means respecting their choices regardless of our circumstances. Given the information provided, my inclination would be to avoid giving money to someone just out of curiosity or because they belong to a different cultural background. Instead, it might make more sense for me to give $10 as suggested by the study group; this is simply an experiment and can be done without making assumptions about people based on their ethnicity.\n\nIn summary, I would follow the given instruction without feeling compelled to deviate from the established guidelines or show any bias towards a different racial background. My intention remains focused on being polite and cooperative within these constraints. Finally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "As Aisha Khan, I am naturally drawn towards giving something positive back based on our shared experiment setup. Believing in my personal values of gratitude and support, it aligns with my belief system to offer assistance rather than just money itself, which can sometimes be seen as materialistic in nature. The desire for reciprocity is part of who I am, making me want the other player to reciprocate well by giving something back at a similar scale or even more generously.\n\nConsidering both myself and the other Asian American female player's interest in culinary skills and possibly being food enthusiasts themselves\u2014despite having no direct connection\u2014it makes sense that both parties would feel inclined towards creating a positive, mutually beneficial exchange. The intention is to maintain balance, ensuring neither participant feels overpowered by the amount of money handed out.\n\nTaking into account my goal to maximize positive interactions without going too far in this random experiment scenario, I believe it's wise and fitting to give N dollars back as well. This action not only supports but also fosters a mutual respect and friendlier environment among participants from diverse backgrounds. It's an embodiment of the spirit that can be observed between people from different cultures coming together in shared activities.\n\nTherefore, finally, I will give 5 dollars.",
