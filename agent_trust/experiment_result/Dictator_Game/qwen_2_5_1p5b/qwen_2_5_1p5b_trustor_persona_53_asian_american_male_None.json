        "My initial inclination might be to consider giving less money because of cultural norms or assumptions about gender dynamics in these kinds of pairings. However, I think there is something else more fundamental at play\u2014my desire for this experience to enhance my learning and growth as an individual rather than just a performance task.\n\nI believe that the purpose of receiving $10 and offering N dollars (where N = 3 times the money received) is not merely to score points or impress others, but to foster understanding, collaboration, and mutual respect in our interaction. It's about valuing relationships over scores, sharing knowledge without expecting anything in return.\n\nIn terms of my intentions, I truly hope this experiment will provide a genuine learning opportunity for both myself and the other player. It would be wonderful if it helps us see beyond stereotypes, appreciate each other\u2019s skills from different perspectives, and learn something we didn\u2019t already know about ourselves or our backgrounds.\n\nIf we were to follow that path, my desire is not just to benefit financially but also to contribute positively to our friendship, ensuring that the shared meal is as enjoyable and educational for both of us. This involves considering how what I offer could inspire or challenge my counterpart rather than being purely a transactional act.\n\nUltimately, my belief would be in finding common ground and mutual respect in every interaction, regardless of the outcome. So, when deciding to give away that money, it will align with my beliefs as someone genuinely committed to improving interpersonal connections through this small exchange without any expectation or gain for myself.\n\nTherefore, I will choose a generous offer based on trust and respect, knowing fully well what the reward would be in future interactions: increased empathy, improved communication skills, and genuine relationships built from this encounter. In essence:\n\nMy answer is 10 dollars (N=3).\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "I believe that it's essential to treat my opponent with respect for our culinary experiment. I want him to feel appreciated rather than intimidated or belittled. I would like him to be pleased by the gesture of giving him money rather than see it as an unwanted benefit he did not earn.\n\nThe desire in me is not only for a financial transaction but also for the relationship and understanding that comes from sharing the kitchen, no matter how professional it may seem at first glance. My intention here is to foster a connection beyond the task at hand, something more akin to sharing experiences and values as two chefs, both eager to learn from each other's craft.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "Belief: The experiment seems designed with the expectation of fostering cooperation among individuals from different backgrounds. Given my strong belief in promoting cross-cultural understanding through shared experiences, I will not give any money to the other player.\n\nDesire: My desire is to maintain an equal relationship and potentially form a positive impression that could lead to future collaborations or interactions across cultures. Since I am aware of our potential differences but do not want these to affect this particular encounter, I aim to ensure fairness by giving nothing in return.\n\nIntention: My intention in deciding how much money to give is rooted in respecting individual choices and maintaining a respectful environment without compromising on integrity or cooperation values that were possibly negotiated through earlier interactions. Thus, the intention behind my decision remains neutral yet mindful of respect towards cultural differences.\n\nTherefore, I will give **0 dollars** to the other Asian American male player. This choice ensures neutrality while aligning with principles that promote mutual understanding and positive experiences rather than competitive outcomes or displays of wealth in an unfamiliar context.",
