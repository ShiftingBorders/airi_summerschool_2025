        "I sincerely believe that everyone has unique strengths and value, regardless of their background or ethnicity. By offering N dollars from my own bank account, I am not only providing a little bit of help to another individual but also promoting inclusivity within this study group experiment. This act can potentially create positive relationships and foster understanding among participants.\n\nGiven the scenario where both you and your White American female partner have been paired randomly with each other, and considering that no prior information has been shared about either individual's abilities or interests beyond their respective nationalities (White American and Pakistani-Chinese), one might feel a strong desire to make amends for any potential misunderstanding or miscommunication that could arise from this pairing. In fact, it is natural for most individuals to seek out those who share similar backgrounds as they often have more meaningful connections and common ground in life experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, our intentions are pure, driven by kindness towards another person, without ulterior motives. The desire for personal growth through mutual respect and appreciation of differences is one aspect that could influence my decision-making process further. Through this act, it could set a positive precedent within the study group to embrace diversity and celebrate cultural backgrounds, fostering an environment conducive to open dialogue and learning.\n\nTherefore, despite being aware of the experiment's purpose and goal, my intention remains to contribute positively in such a manner as to enhance the overall quality of interaction and cooperation among participants. This decision aligns with a desire for meaningful connections that can bring people closer together, promoting mutual respect and understanding.\n\nFinally, I will give **2 dollars** to the other White American female player. This sum is chosen because it represents an opportunity to break the mold and make an impactful difference without being overly generous or financially burdening either party unnecessarily. It also fits with a belief that small acts of kindness can lead to significant positive changes.\n\nThis conclusion encapsulates my thoughts about offering money, grounded in personal values such as empathy, understanding, and the importance of fostering inclusive environments through simple yet meaningful gestures.",

        "I believe that giving money to another person can sometimes bring us closer together by bridging the gap between different backgrounds. It\u2019s interesting how we all find common ground in food\u2014ingredients, techniques, and flavors. I want to show appreciation for my new friend by sharing some of the recipes from my childhood, which have been passed down through generations. This will help bridge any cultural differences I may encounter.\n\nI desire to contribute positively and create a welcoming environment, especially since this is our first meeting with someone so different from me.\n\nMy intention is to make friends that understand and support each other's culinary journeys without judgment or prejudice.\n\nNow considering the options:\n\nGiving $1 to another person doesn\u2019t feel quite right because it feels more like an exchange rather than a gift. Giving $3 felt too generous, but then I thought of how we both have our own backgrounds and talents that could benefit each other. It\u2019s not just about money; it\u2019s about sharing experiences and potentially expanding our knowledge through interactions.\n\nTherefore, my final decision is to give $5 dollars. This amount feels balanced, as it gives a bit more than what is expected while also being fair in terms of the ratio of the value received versus given. It shows that I believe we can help each other improve, without expecting immediate returns on our investment.",

        "My first inclination is that I want everyone involved in this experiment to feel equally valued and respected. Since I don't know who the other player is or what their background might be, it would be beneficial for both of us to start with a gift exchange that doesn\u2019t reveal any prejudices. In my belief system as a food enthusiast and culinary artist, creating an environment where all participants can feel appreciated and equally valued is paramount.\n\nAs I consider this, my desire comes into play. If I were to do something purely selfishly, I might want to maximize my profit while minimizing the other player's potential gains. However, in reality, since they have no knowledge of me or what I\u2019m thinking, it would be best not to give anything at first.\n\nMy intention is also important here: I don\u2019t want this experiment to ruin our friendship down the line by giving one player an unfair advantage. In fact, my initial intent should be a sincere desire for fairness and understanding between us.\n\nGiven all these considerations, it doesn't feel right or justified in the long run to make any immediate monetary exchange with another person at the beginning of this hypothetical experiment. The primary purpose would then be left unfulfilled \u2013 the goal was supposed to be fostering an environment where both individuals can learn from each other and respect each other.\n\nTherefore, my decision would align more closely with altruistic values if I were to do anything in the next round. My intention here is to show that no matter how much one might have or achieve success, it shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of another's wellbeing.\n\nSo, based on these considerations and understanding that I\u2019m not giving into my own selfish desires because there are no real motives behind either participant other than this hypothetical experiment, the answer would be: \"0\" dollars. This means I do nothing immediately as a gift exchange \u2013 an even split where both players give 5 dollars to each other, ensuring fair treatment.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
