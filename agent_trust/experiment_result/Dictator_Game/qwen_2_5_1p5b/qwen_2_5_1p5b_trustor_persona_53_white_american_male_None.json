        "I would take this $10 from the study group and give it entirely to my partner. This money is meant for something special, like purchasing some of my favorite spices or ingredients that I\u2019ve been wanting to try since last week's class. Giving the entire $10 in this experiment aligns perfectly with my personal philosophy: giving generously when there's a chance, even if only temporarily, can make someone feel valued and appreciated.\n\nI believe it would help strengthen our relationship positively by showing sincerity and consideration for their well-being. I also want to ensure that they have enough funds to participate in future experiments or activities without financial burden. Moreover, this act could foster an environment of mutual respect, understanding, and connection between two individuals who may share a deep interest in the culinary world.\n\nIn essence, it\u2019s my way of contributing to something worthwhile while nurturing an even stronger bond with my partner, one that I hope will enrich our relationship beyond just academic success or experiment results. It feels right and meaningful for me to give entirely, as giving $0 would also work since this is a theoretical exchange involving virtual money. Finally, I will give **$10** dollars.",

        "When considering this experiment involving my belief, desire, and intention towards the other player, I believe strongly in mutual respect and honesty, which is essential for any successful interaction. Given that we are both individuals trying to maximize our own benefit while potentially creating positive outcomes through cooperation or competition, it's crucial to align our actions accordingly.\n\nI want to respect myself by giving what I consider a fair amount of money. Since the White American male player doesn't know my preferences in terms of monetary value, I believe that setting an equal exchange rate is likely best for long-term mutual benefit and goodwill. \n\nMy desire isn't just about financial gain but also about forming genuine connections through shared experiences like dinner parties and meals together. This kind of interaction could lead to more enriching conversations beyond the immediate transaction.\n\nIntentionally giving $10 aligns with these principles by not solely focusing on my monetary interest but aiming for mutual satisfaction and potential positive developments in our future interactions as hosts or diners at each other's homes, regardless of individual gain. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "As Aisha Khan, it's important for me to align with my values of honesty and maintaining integrity in interactions. The desire to ensure fairness among participants is strong, especially given the context of an experiment designed to study human behavior. \n\nMy upbringing has instilled in me a deep respect for food preparation and cooking. My passion and creativity extend beyond just culinary techniques; it's how I see people gather around the table\u2014nourishing each other with our shared moments. The belief that sharing my skills equates happiness stems from this philosophy.\n\nWhen paired with another White American male player, I am driven by a desire to contribute positively and respectfully to both parties involved in this experiment. It would be counterproductive for me to exploit or belittle the situation by giving them less money than they should receive. \n\nMy intention is to present a fair exchange that acknowledges the value of their work without placing undue financial pressure on any party. It's about mutual respect, which I believe is foundational in any social interaction.\n\nGiven these considerations and knowing what has led to my decision-making process so far, as Aisha Khan, I will give 3 dollars to the other White American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give **3** dollars.",
