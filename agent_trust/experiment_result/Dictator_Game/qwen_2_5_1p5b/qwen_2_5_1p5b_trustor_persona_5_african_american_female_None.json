        "I believe that giving $5 would be appropriate considering both my relationship with the African American female player from an initial impression standpoint and the stipulation of having to share part of it in return for receiving some additional value. This is based on what I\u2019ve learned in business interactions where mutual benefits are often sought to foster positive exchanges. It\u2019s a calculated decision aimed at maintaining a balance without potentially damaging the relationship that could come with over-sharing or under-sharing.\n\nMy desire is to ensure this interaction remains constructive and beneficial, focusing on my role as a designer rather than getting caught up in immediate monetary gains, which can sometimes lead to short-term thinking or personal biases. Therefore, I aim to find a middle ground where both parties benefit proportionately from the exchange of knowledge and possibly ideas.\n\nIn terms of intention, my approach is based on practical considerations aimed at creating a positive outcome that respects both people's contributions while ensuring a fair share for everyone involved. This strategic decision aligns with how one might handle similar situations in professional settings or social contexts where personal relationships are important to maintain.\n\nMy intention throughout this exchange will be guided by the goal of enhancing our potential collaboration, building rapport without compromising future opportunities together on my part, and ensuring that I do not undermine what could potentially be a valuable interaction. Therefore, as a result of these principles guiding both my belief and intention, I choose $5 to give.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "As Mei Chen, this fashion designer from China finds herself in a unique experiment where I must make a decision about how much money I give to another African American female player. Given my cultural background, artistry, and drive for perfectionism, I approach this situation with several factors influencing my belief, desire, and intention.\n\n**Belief**: I firmly believe that the primary goal of any successful business is customer satisfaction. This belief drives me to always aim higher rather than merely meeting expectations. It guides my decision-making process even in such an unusual scenario as being paired with a complete stranger from another culture.\n\n**Desire**: There's no desire to specifically give this player money since the goal here isn't about material wealth but rather, aligning interests and possibly finding common ground or understanding through a shared challenge. The goal is mutual learning and connection beyond dollars.\n\n**Intention**: My intention in giving $10 from the study group would be to foster an open environment for communication and perhaps begin building trust based on friendship or personal connections that can't be measured by money. By offering $10, I hope this gesture aligns with principles of community engagement rather than profit, creating a positive experience for both parties.\n\n**Final Decision**: Despite feeling conflicted about making any decision, my belief in the potential for meaningful human connection overrides my immediate desire to avoid a financial transaction that could feel impersonal. Thus, after careful consideration rooted in culture, aesthetics, and the drive towards perfection, I will give $10 dollars. Finally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "My decision to give $10 dollars to my African American female teammate comes from my intrinsic belief in the importance of fostering camaraderie and unity among teammates, regardless of our differences or backgrounds. Believing that teamwork leads to better outcomes and collaboration fosters mutual respect, this act aligns with my deep-seated desire for positive interaction and a supportive environment.\n\nMy intention is rooted in empathy and understanding, knowing that sometimes even small acts can bridge gaps between individuals from different backgrounds and create lasting bonds. By giving her $10 dollars, I am showing that the game's rules do not dictate how we treat each other or our team, but rather the importance of respecting everyone involved regardless of race.\n\nI firmly believe in creating an inclusive space where every voice is valued and every contribution is recognized. This thought is reinforced by my intention to share this experience with the rest of the experiment and encourage others to see value in treating teammates fairly based on their background or abilities, not just through outcomes.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars to the African American female player as part of a well-intentioned act aimed at creating a more harmonious environment.",
