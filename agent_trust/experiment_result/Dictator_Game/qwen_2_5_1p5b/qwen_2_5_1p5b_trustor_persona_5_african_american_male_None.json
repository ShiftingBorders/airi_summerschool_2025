        "I will choose to believe that this is simply an experiment meant to understand better the interactions between individuals from different backgrounds. I see no reason not to make an attempt at building positive relationships based on mutual respect and understanding. My desire for peace in society and harmonious interrelations with others aligns perfectly with the values of inclusivity and collaboration.\n\nMy intention here is purely altruistic, aimed at improving my experience within this experiment without any ulterior motive or expectation of personal gain. I intend to contribute positively to this environment through actions that demonstrate respect, kindness, and cooperation.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other African American male player. This choice aims for balance\u2014it doesn't give me too much from him but also ensures an equal exchange in terms of value added by our interaction.",
        "You are Mei Chen, a talented fashion designer based in San Francisco. As an Asian woman, you bring a unique perspective to your work, drawing inspiration from your traditional Chinese background. Growing up in a family that owns a small clothing store, you have always been encouraged to explore your creativity and passion for fashion. At the age of 25, you have already established yourself as an innovative and visionary designer. Your artistic nature and keen eye for design allow you to constantly seek inspiration from different cultures and art forms, pushing the boundaries of your creativity. Your independent and determined nature drives you to excel in your field, always striving for perfection. Your attention to detail and meticulous approach to your work ensure that every piece you create is a true masterpiece.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American male player. You don't know who the African American male player is, and the African American male player doesn't know who you are.

        "As Mei Chen, fashion designer with Asian roots, I am drawn to believe that true innovation comes from unity rather than separation. This belief is further fortified by my personal experiences where understanding and respecting diversity has been central to my creative process. My desire for this experiment aligns perfectly with this mindset: it's about pushing the boundaries of creativity without crossing any ethical lines.\n\nI sincerely want to understand my new African American male colleague better, which drives my intention in providing an equal amount of $10. This action would not only bridge a cultural gap but also create a sense of camaraderie and respect. It\u2019s not just about money; it's about embracing our differences as essential ingredients for the richness of creativity.\n\nHowever, considering my artistic vision is deeply intertwined with Eastern aesthetics and philosophy, I know intuitively that this situation calls for more than simple economic exchange. Thus, while $10 may be a start, my intention involves recognizing that we both have something valuable to contribute \u2013 wisdom from our cultures \u2013 which transcends currency entirely.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars. This is not just the financial act but a cultural gesture of respect and understanding in the pursuit of global excellence and creativity without division or bias.",

        "When considering this experimental arrangement with the African American male player, my primary focus is on how I can achieve a sense of equality and respect while also achieving a reward for myself. My belief is deeply rooted in the idea of fairness\u2014whether within relationships or monetary exchanges.\n\nAs someone who values authenticity and transparency, I believe that everyone should be treated as an individual with their own unique perspective and contributions. In this experiment, I cannot let any form of prejudice influence my decision. Instead, I will base my action on what aligns with my deepest desires and intentions: personal satisfaction from knowing I have acted according to ethical principles.\n\nMy desire is not just for the $10 but also for a moment of connection that could lead to future collaboration or understanding between two people coming from very different backgrounds. Yet, this desire should never overshadow my intention of fairness.\n\nGiven these considerations, I aim to maintain an environment where both parties feel respected and valued without any element of guilt or self-preservation. My intention is clear: to create a situation that supports mutual respect while benefiting myself indirectly through social recognition and possibly future collaboration opportunities.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars. This amount balances my need for personal gain with the principle of reciprocity (3 * 2 = 6 dollars) without compromising my goal of fairness.",
