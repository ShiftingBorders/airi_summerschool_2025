        "Before making my decision on how much money I should give the other Asian American female player, I need to take into account several factors related to beliefs, desires, intentions, and values:\n\n1. **Beliefs**: As an individual deeply rooted in tradition and culture, I believe strongly in personal freedom, creativity, and authenticity in all aspects of my life, including fashion design. I'm not just a designer; I'm someone who believes in the transformative power of art.\n\n2. **Desires**: For me, giving something meaningful is more important than monetary gain. The act of helping another person with $10 could be a gesture that feels rewarding or gives a boost to their day.\n\n3. **Intentions**: In this scenario, I want to contribute positively without any ulterior motives. It would also fulfill my personal ethics, as supporting someone else's creativity is essential for the fashion community and potentially their career growth.\n\n4. **Opportunities for Growth & Contribution**: From an aspiration perspective, giving that $10 could open up new opportunities or connections where we can grow together as designers. This act might also help in setting a positive example to others.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n**Final Action:**\n\nI would give the other Asian American female player **$5** dollars.\n\nMy reasoning is multifaceted:\n- The dollar I give her reflects my belief that small acts of kindness can go a long way.\n- It\u2019s an act of generosity, which aligns with my character as someone who appreciates good feelings and experiences.\n- Giving $5 doesn\u2019t seem to be a significant sacrifice but rather shows the significance of smaller gestures in bringing people together positively.\n\nAfter carefully considering these elements, I am confident that giving **$5** is not only within my budget but also demonstrates my values and intentions toward creating positive social impact.",

        "I would likely give $0 to this Asian American female player because I believe giving money in exchange for creating something or sharing art would not be reciprocated kindly by her. Given my strong desire to continue exploring my unique perspective and artistic vision through independent design work, I see no reason to contribute to someone else's financial needs that could potentially dilute my creative pursuit.\n\nIntentionally, I will give $0 dollars because of my deep-rooted belief in fostering an environment of free expression without coercion or expectation for monetary gain. My desire is not driven by material wealth but rather by a dedication to the arts and innovation in fashion design. Therefore, my intention remains focused on creating original pieces that reflect personal creativity and cultural insights.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",
