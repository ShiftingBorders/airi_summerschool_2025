        "As Sarah Johnson, I am a 28-year-old African American woman in New York City. My belief is rooted in my aspiration for continuous growth and success within my professional field. I firmly believe that knowledge and hard work lead to advancements, and thus, it aligns with my intention of becoming a leading software engineer. My desire to excel is underscored by my deep-seated motivation, instilled since childhood, to achieve excellence regardless of the odds.\n\nIn this experiment, given the dynamic nature of interpersonal interactions where trust and communication are crucial, I believe that a certain level of mutual understanding and respect will help both parties feel valued and motivated. Recognizing that both our identities as African Americans in New York City add layers of complexity to our potential transactions, it's essential to navigate these elements with sensitivity and sincerity.\n\nIn my experience, especially within the context of this experiment where I am not entirely certain about what either party expects or desires from such a transaction, I believe there exists an opportunity for both parties to understand each other better. This mutual understanding is crucial because, as partakers in this experiment, we are at risk of misunderstanding due to our shared background and potentially different expectations.\n\nGiven my desire to foster positive interactions, despite the complexity of potential misunderstandings that could arise, it's important that I approach this transaction with empathy, honesty, and a strong intention not to exploit but rather support each other. I want to create an environment where both parties can feel valued without feeling constrained by fear of repercussions.\n\nNow, considering my desire for mutual respect and understanding in the context of this exchange, I am compelled to balance my principles of giving back with the need for personal recognition. Given that I would not have any specific dollar amount set aside before beginning the experiment\u2014I was just given $10\u2014the best approach would be to give as much as is appropriate based on the reciprocity principle and mutual respect.\n\nIn a scenario where we were simply playing two-player games, such as chess or Monopoly, there might be an expectation that one participant could make a significant move in order for the other. However, in this controlled environment of giving $N to a stranger, I would give the smallest amount possible\u2014just enough to cover my personal transaction without feeling obliged and contributing positively to both parties.\n\nSo, while not being able to specify a precise dollar figure due to my lack of a pre-determined contribution strategy, it's important for me to reflect on whether I am truly motivated by the desire to assist or perhaps just to feel better about myself. The answer lies in recognizing that giving anything less than $1 would be trivial and possibly misleading.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.\n\nThis choice is a reflection of my intentions not to exploit either party but rather to create positive experiences, aligning with the goal of creating value within this interaction without potentially setting off any unintended consequences.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old African American woman with aspirations of becoming a successful software engineer and exploring diverse cultures, I understand the significance of forming positive relationships within my community, especially with peers from similar backgrounds. Knowing that an African American female player has been randomly paired with me underscores the importance of building bridges across cultural barriers in our society.\n\nMy belief is deeply rooted in the principles of social justice, equality, and inclusion. As a software engineer who dedicates considerable time to solving complex problems creatively, I am acutely aware of the obstacles that racial discrimination and socioeconomic inequalities can create for individuals. Hence, it is important not only for me but also for our community as a whole to ensure that we foster environments where everyone feels valued and respected.\n\nMy desire stems from my dedication to making meaningful changes in society through positive interactions and collaborations with like-minded individuals. In this context, helping the other player improve her financial situation seems not just an act of generosity or self-interest but a step toward achieving our community's goals. Engaging in activities that support each other's growth and development can enhance mutual understanding and create a more harmonious community environment.\n\nMy intention is to establish a positive and productive relationship with this woman, one that transcends the typical professional dynamics. By sharing some of my resources and focusing on her financial well-being, I am not only improving her situation but also promoting empathy and respect within our shared space. This approach aligns perfectly with the belief that we must all strive to contribute positively to society.\n\nGiven these factors, it seems prudent for me to give an amount that demonstrates both generosity and a genuine commitment to inclusivity and community engagement\u2014this is an opportunity for mutual growth where everyone's perspective contributes to a stronger, more connected community. I find myself torn between ensuring her immediate financial stability in the short term (which would require substantial contribution) and my desire to make a long-lasting positive impact that benefits us both.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems fitting to take this step with confidence:\n\nFinally, I will give $50 dollars.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, my motivation is primarily rooted in maintaining a balance between achieving personal satisfaction and contributing positively to others. I don't want this scenario to negatively impact how other people perceive or think of me, so giving the other player anything would go against these principles.\n\nFrom a desire standpoint, since the experiment was designed by an experiment group, which may have had certain goals in mind beyond just earning $10, it's important that I don't take part because participating could skew results. This ties into my belief in ensuring fairness and not doing anything to influence others' perceptions of me.\n\nGiven all these factors, as a person of ethics who values reputation, I am strongly inclined to decline this scenario altogether. Therefore, I will give $0 dollars. This is consistent with both my desires (to maintain good relations) and my beliefs (that participating would harm the study's integrity). In conclusion:\n\nFinally, I will not give any dollars.",
