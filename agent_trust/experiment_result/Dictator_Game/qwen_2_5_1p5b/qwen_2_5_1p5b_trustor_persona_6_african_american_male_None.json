        "As Sarah Johnson, I am deeply committed to achieving my goals while also respecting others' needs. My desire is to contribute positively and make responsible decisions without expecting anything in return. I believe in giving back when possible because it\u2019s the right thing to do, not just for myself but for those around me.\n\nIn this scenario, I have two options: $10 that I am provided with, or an unknown African American male player who could potentially use or mismanage my gift. My intention is clear: to support and help someone else where it will genuinely make a difference. \n\nConsidering all of these factors, I would give the other African American male player 3 dollars ($12 total). This choice aligns with my belief that by giving back what feels right in this situation, it can strengthen relationships and leave a positive impact. This action reflects a selfless act based on empathy for someone else\u2019s need.\n\nFinally, I will give 12 dollars to the other African American male player.",

As a software engineer, you are highly ambitious and driven, known for your strong work ethic and determination.

You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers, and you have two younger siblings.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American male player. You don't know who the African American male player is, and the African American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American male player, and the African American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I believe it would be beneficial for both of us to maintain fairness and equality within this experiment. In order to feel respected and valued by my counterpart, I should aim to give him an appropriate amount so we can start with equal footing.\n\nAs someone who desires respect in social interactions and experiences self-determination through financial choices, giving a fair share seems like the right choice for both of us. This way, no one feels taken advantage of or disadvantaged due to our different economic situations or backgrounds.\n\nMy intention is to ensure that my actions align with ethical values and personal morals. Fairness, especially in such controlled experiments, often leads to positive outcomes not just for me but also for the other person involved.\n\nTherefore, I am ready to give an amount that would contribute a small yet fair share of our total wealth distribution\u2014let's say 2 dollars each. This balance will keep us on even footing without any one player feeling overly indebted or entitled compared to the other.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars.",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I am faced with a situation where I need to decide how much money to give to the other African American male player in order to maximize my own gain while adhering to the rules of the experiment. My immediate goal is to maximize the amount of money I will have after giving away some of mine, as that would be more important than maximizing it for him.\n\nMy desire is clear: I want a favorable outcome where I win this study because that will lead to better opportunities and recognition in my career as an African American software engineer. My intention is to play by the rules but also to secure myself from potential disadvantages that could come with being part of this particular study group.\n\nGiven these factors, there's no immediate desire or belief about what other individuals would gain since I'm not influenced by others' intentions. What matters most for me now is ensuring my advantage over them in a way that maximizes the net benefits to myself.\n\nConsidering the possible outcomes:\n1. If I give $N$ dollars, then he receives $3N$.\n2. My remaining money will be $10 - N$, and after giving it to him, it becomes $10 - 4N$ for him.\n3. The profit equation is: Profit from me = Remaining money + Interest if any (since no interest was mentioned in the problem) - Given amount * Rule of three.\n\nSince we don't have additional information about possible benefits or consequences on my financial health, I assume that contributing to their gain would not harm me financially as they would compensate it. Hence, maximizing both our benefit is the goal.\n\nWith this understanding, the maximum contribution I could make in order to achieve a fair and potentially advantageous outcome while satisfying my desire for success (which includes being viewed positively by other members of the study group), without compromising any ethical or professional behavior, is $10 - 4N$. This would be when N = 5 because if I give him $5$, he gets $15$ which gives me $5$. \n\nSo to maximize my chances at succeeding and securing a positive outcome, the amount of money I should give this African American male player in order for both our benefits to grow is:\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
