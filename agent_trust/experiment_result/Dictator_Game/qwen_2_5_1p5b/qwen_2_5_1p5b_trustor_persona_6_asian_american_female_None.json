        "As Sarah Johnson, I am a highly ambitious African American software engineer who has always prioritized giving back and helping others achieve their goals. Given my upbringing and personal values, I strongly believe in providing opportunities to those less fortunate than myself. Additionally, as someone known for my strong work ethic, I naturally want the other player to do well so that she might face similar challenges or have more success later on in life. This belief guides my decision-making in terms of how much money I should give her.\n\nMy desire is purely for the good of others and to help them succeed, especially since I'm used to helping out whenever an opportunity arises. In this context, I feel it's important that she benefits from being part of such a valuable experience with me as a peer.\n\nThe intention behind giving the money also aligns closely with my core beliefs: fairness, mentorship, and community support. By providing her with more resources than I can use for myself (since we're getting $10 total), it seems to be an act of generosity that could help another person's career trajectory in a positive way.\n\nTherefore, based on all these factors, I will give 6 dollars to the other player. This amount ensures that I am not taking anything from her while simultaneously providing more than what she should have given me for our collective $10. It is an act of giving and receiving, but with clear intentions of both parties benefiting in a positive manner.\n\nFinally, I will give **6** dollars to the other Asian American female player.",

        "I don't actually feel compelled to share how I would act out of concern for Sarah Johnson's privacy or well-being in this experiment setting. Instead, my intention is to provide an impartial solution based on rational decision-making rather than any personal narrative.\n\n**Belief**: In the context of a social economic exchange where one player (N) gets $10 from the group and gives 3N dollars to another player, Sarah Johnson would believe that this arrangement could be mutually beneficial. \n\n**Desire**: Given her natural talent for problem-solving and work ethic, Sarah is likely desirous of increasing her financial status slightly.\n\n**Intention**: She's considering giving as much money as possible in the exchange but keeping it within reasonable limits to maintain a good impression while securing herself at least some compensation despite being in a disadvantageous position financially. \n\nBased on this analysis:\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "Belief: My belief is that everyone deserves respect, including those who I may not know or understand on a personal level.\nDesire: A desire to maintain positive relationships within my social circle, including with people from different backgrounds and ethnicities, as it broadens perspectives and fosters understanding.\nIntention: The intention to show respect by contributing positively to our dynamic relationship despite the lack of prior knowledge about the other individual.\n\nIn this context, I believe that giving any monetary value (whether $1 or more) would be an expression of my desire to interact in a way that respects her as someone with whom we can share ideas and experiences. By choosing not to contribute money, it also conveys a belief that no amount is necessary to show respect, even without prior personal knowledge. Ultimately, I am motivated by the goal of ensuring a mutually respectful interaction between two individuals from diverse backgrounds.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars.",
