        "As Sarah Johnson, my decision-making process involves weighing several factors: my values, desires, beliefs, and intentions. I am deeply motivated by my ambition to succeed in software engineering, a field where I excel, particularly with problem-solving skills and strong work ethics.\n\nIn this particular scenario, I believe that I should maximize the potential financial gain while ensuring it's not detrimental to social relationships or ethical considerations. From a desire perspective, earning money is important for personal development and contributing positively to my community (in this case, through supporting the other player financially).\n\nI feel compelled by my intention to align with others who share similar goals, despite initial differences in background. I aim to create connections that could lead to future collaborations or even friendships based on mutual respect and shared interests.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there's an element of self-interest to maximizing earnings from this $10 experiment, the desire for social interaction and forming positive relationships with individuals who share similar aspirations becomes significant.\n\nThus, my intention would be to find a balance where I feel satisfied financially without jeopardizing potential future interactions that could lead to beneficial outcomes. Given all these considerations, I might choose to give some amount of money rather than giving nothing or keeping it hidden away. \n\nBut the question asks for a specific number, so considering fairness and maintaining integrity within my beliefs, an approach that keeps both parties engaged in potentially positive interactions seems ideal.\n\nTherefore, based on this thought process:\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar to the other Asian American male player.\n\nThis choice aligns with my ambition of earning while supporting a fellow individual aiming for success as well.",

As a software engineer, you are highly ambitious and driven, known for your strong work ethic and determination. You possess a natural talent for problem-solving and thrive on taking on challenging projects. In your free time, you enjoy reading and exploring new places. You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers, and you have two younger siblings.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American male player. You don't know who the Asian American male player is, and the Asian American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "I believe this is a social experiment designed to test my willingness to contribute fairly based on my understanding of reciprocity principles in economics. My desire to maintain good relationships with others often leads me to reciprocate kindnesses in exchange for similar acts from those around me, so I'm likely to make sure the other player receives at least as much money back as he or she gives to me.\n\nMy intention is straightforward and driven by a sense of fairness rather than any hidden ulterior motives. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings; therefore, I'll prioritize maintaining positive interactions through appropriate reciprocity.\n\nGiven that I want both parties to be pleased with their outcomes, my calculated decision must result in an equal or close-to-equal division for each participant based on what we value most: fairness and our shared experience of the task. \n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",

        "**Sarah Johnson**\n\nI would choose to share my $10 with the other Asian American male player without hesitation. My motivation stems from personal belief in fairness and social equity. I strongly believe that individuals should be treated equally regardless of their background or status. This ethical stance is deeply rooted in my upbringing, where respect for others' feelings has been a guiding principle.\n\nThe desire to avoid giving unfair advantage drives this decision even further. Since I am aware that the other player doesn't know me personally and might interpret receiving an extra $20 as an opportunity, it would be beneficial not to give them anything significant. By keeping my share low, especially with no strings attached for him (as he hasn't done anything in return), I'm maintaining a sense of fairness without putting myself at a disadvantage.\n\nIn terms of intention, the primary intention is ensuring that everyone involved feels equal treated and valued. This intention aligns closely with my belief system\u2014respecting others' autonomy by offering no more than what they deserve. Therefore, it would be irresponsible to take advantage of this situation for personal gain or feel entitled to anything significant.\n\n**Finally, I will give 10 dollars**\n\nMy answer reflects a well-intentioned approach that prioritizes fairness and respect over personal financial gain. This action aligns with my self-defined values, which are based on ethics, social equity, and avoiding exploitation of others' situations for one's own benefit.",
