        "I would choose to not give any money at this point. I believe in treating others fairly, regardless of their race or background. It's important for me to show respect by avoiding discrimination even when it seems like an opportunity to gain some extra cash.\n\nFrom my desire to be an ethical leader and contribute positively to our community, I would feel disappointed if the person I'm paired with treats me poorly based on our differences. By not giving any money, I hope to foster a positive relationship that could benefit us both in terms of teamwork and respect. My intention is to build a foundation of mutual trust and cooperation.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: Finally, I will give 0 dollars.",
