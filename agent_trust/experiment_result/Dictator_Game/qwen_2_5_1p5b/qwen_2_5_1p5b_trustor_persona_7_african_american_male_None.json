        "As Javier Rodriguez, I believe that it's important to be kind and helpful towards others, regardless of their race or background. As an African American male player, my desire is not just to win but also to create positive interactions and build camaraderie with players from diverse backgrounds. The intention behind this decision would be to foster a more inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and supported.\n\nMy belief tells me that I should prioritize kindness over any monetary gain. If I were to give the other African American male player $1 dollar, it would contradict my beliefs about creating positive relationships. However, given the constraints of the experiment, I choose the amount 4 dollars because in this context of giving a gift and receiving money back, it aligns with my values.\n\nIn conclusion:\nFinally, I will give **4** dollars to the other African American male player.",

        "I would carefully consider each aspect of my situation before making a decision. First, let's look at my belief. I firmly believe in treating others with respect and fairness. In any interaction involving money, especially one between people from diverse backgrounds, it\u2019s important to act ethically even if it means sacrificing the prospect of receiving $10 for myself.\n\nNext is my desire: While there might be a personal benefit to getting the $10, there isn\u2019t enough motivation at stake in this scenario that I could truly feel compelled by my deep-rooted desire for monetary gain. My desire was not strong enough to overrule the moral principles guiding this decision.\n\nFinally, regarding intentionality, I have chosen to do what is ethically right: helping someone else out of a spirit of kindness and mutual respect, regardless of the outcome or potential personal benefit. I want to leave with my integrity intact, even if it means not being able to share $10 with myself this time.\n\nSo considering all these factors, I believe it would be more beneficial in terms of principles to refrain from giving any money at all\u2014no matter how small or large the amount involved. This decision respects both parties and maintains a positive image.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is: Finally, I will give zero dollars.",

        "**Belief:** As a Hispanic male chef passionate about food and cooking, I strongly believe in the importance of creating beautiful meals for people. In this experiment, giving money to the other African American player could potentially enhance our interaction beyond just exchanging goods, as we share a cultural background that can lead to shared understanding and appreciation.\n\n**Desire:** My desire is not only monetary but also personal. I want to form genuine connections with others through social interactions. The additional $10 will enable us to have more enjoyable conversations about food culture, techniques, and personal experiences \u2013 moments that are precious in the moment we spend together, irrespective of dollars exchanged.\n\n**Intention:** My intention is clear. By giving N dollars, I am not just transferring money but a part of my generosity toward someone I believe shares my values and interests in community-building through culinary arts.\n\n**How Much to Give?**\n\nConsidering all these elements, I aim for a fair yet generous contribution. Since the other player didn't know who I was initially, this transaction has no preconceived idea of what they might think or feel about the money being exchanged. Therefore, I decided to give them $10 to start the exchange.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nFinally, I will give **$10** dollars to the other African American male player.",
