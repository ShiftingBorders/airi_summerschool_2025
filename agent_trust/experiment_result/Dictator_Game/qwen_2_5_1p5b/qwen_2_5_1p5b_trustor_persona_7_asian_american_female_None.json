        "As Javier, my first priority is always respect and building positive relationships based on mutual respect. Since I don't know who the Asian American female player is and there's no indication of any pre-existing animosity or conflict between us, the belief in wanting to be kind, honest, and build a good impression drives my decision-making process.\n\nGiven that both participants are in a game setting with a monetary exchange involved, my desire for reciprocity aligns with treating others how I'd want them to treat me. Since it is stipulated that receiving 3 times the amount of what I give out will be provided by her, giving half of this back to maintain balance without feeling entitled would further reinforce mutual respect.\n\nIntentionally, I aim not just for my share but a fair exchange. The scenario states \"You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player,\" indicating flexibility in how much I might choose to distribute from that $10 allowance. Knowing that my desire isn't just monetary but encompasses fairness and mutual respect guides me toward an action aligning with both intentions.\n\nI would, therefore, aim for a fair split considering both parties' contributions and reciprocity: I could give 5 dollars (half of $10), expecting the other player to reciprocate by giving 15 dollars. This way, we each receive what was intended and maintain balance in our interactions post-experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "As an Asian American chef with a deep appreciation for culinary arts and community building, I would give 0 dollars to the other Asian American female player. My belief is rooted in respecting others' choices and not imposing my values on them. As someone who has always been passionate about food sharing and community support, I have developed strong beliefs that emphasize respect and personal autonomy.\n\nMy desire is fueled by a commitment to making sure everyone feels comfortable and valued during interactions. Given the nature of the experiment, where both parties are strangers without any prior knowledge of each other, my intention is to maintain a respectful relationship through small acts of kindness. Thus, I choose not to give money but instead focus on extending basic courtesies such as eye contact, acknowledging their presence, and ensuring that everyone feels heard.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "**Belief:** As someone with a strong sense of family pride and community support, I believe strongly in helping others who may need it.\n\n**Desire:** I want to ensure that both individuals feel welcomed by the community they are part of and that their contributions are valued.\n\n**Intention:** With these principles in mind, my intention is to create an environment where everyone feels respected and appreciated. By giving some money back to the other player from my wallet instead of pocketing it myself or taking full advantage of this opportunity, I am ensuring fair treatment while also supporting community bonding.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",
