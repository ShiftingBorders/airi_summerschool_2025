        "I believe that respecting everyone's cultural and personal backgrounds is important. Everyone has their unique experiences and strengths, which should be recognized rather than overshadowed by assumptions or preconceived notions based on their race or background. It would also show consideration for the other person's point of view.\n\nFrom a desire perspective, I would want to make sure that this interaction doesn't cause any negative emotions like anger or jealousy towards my racial identity or culinary traditions.

This would make for a more harmonious interaction and help break down barriers that may exist between individuals based on their race or background.\n\nTherefore, my intended action in this scenario would be:\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "I firmly believe that this experiment is designed to reveal hidden biases or stereotypes, rather than to create opportunities for exchange of ideas or genuine sharing. I also desire to maintain a professional relationship with my partner and preserve the integrity of our study.

        "As a chef of Hispanic descent who loves experimenting with flavors and techniques, I believe that cooking is not only about tasting delicious dishes but also about connecting people through shared experiences in the kitchen. My desire to make others feel welcome has always driven me to create an atmosphere where everyone feels at home. Therefore, I hope this gesture will bring joy and a sense of inclusion to the other White American female player.\n\nI want her to know that despite coming from different backgrounds and cultures, we share common passions and can create positive experiences together. My intention is to foster a mutual respect and understanding in our interactions.\n\nGiven my warm and friendly nature, I believe giving her $2 dollars would be appropriate and aligns with how I treat people who join us at the restaurant or attend events related to cooking and food culture. This amount reflects a small gesture that will have a positive impact on her experience but also allows me to maintain control over what I spend.\n\nIn conclusion, my intention is to create this positive interaction and reinforce the bonds we share through our shared love for good food and culinary experiences. My desire is for this moment to leave an impression of warmth and belonging. Finally, I will give 2 dollars.",
