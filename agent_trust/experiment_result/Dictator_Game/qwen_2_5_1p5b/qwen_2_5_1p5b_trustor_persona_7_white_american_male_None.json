        "Firstly, it's important for me to align with my intrinsic beliefs about fairness and equality in a professional context like this experiment. As someone whose parents instilled values of respect and kindness from an early age, I would prioritize ensuring the disharmony or inequality is minimized when dealing with a person who has different backgrounds or origins.\n\nFrom my standpoint, it's crucial for me to understand that while there are differences between us socially and culturally, these shouldn't dictate the outcome of our interactions. My belief in treating everyone fairly aligns with my desire not to contribute to any further division based on race. Therefore, I believe giving nothing at all is an ethical decision since the arrangement could potentially reinforce existing biases.\n\nGiven this alignment with my beliefs, I firmly commit to following that principle and making no monetary contribution to the other White American male player. My intention for this experiment is to focus on our professional rapport rather than personal advantage or financial gain. \n\nUltimately, based on these considerations, my intention has been shaped by a strong ethical stance toward fairness, equality, and avoiding division. Therefore, I must conclude:\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "My belief is that it would be best not to make any immediate monetary exchange with the other White American male player. From an ethical standpoint, I want to avoid potential discrimination or misunderstanding based on racial stereotypes. The desire to maintain positive relationships and potentially create mutual connections motivates me to think carefully about this decision.\n\nI intend to consider the following points before making a decision:\n\n1. **Prejudice vs. Fairness**: Recognizing that there might be an unconscious bias towards my identity as a Hispanic male, I aim to ensure that the $10 I am offered aligns with fairness rather than prejudice.\n2. **Dignity of Trade**: The principle of dignity suggests that it's important not only for me but also for this other person to feel respected and treated fairly in exchange.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to ensure that the transaction is mutually beneficial and does not exacerbate any potential social issues related to race or ethnicity. \n\nTo balance both moral principles and personal values, I believe giving $10 (rather than any higher amount) would be a prudent approach. Although this means receiving only $3 from him in return, it aligns with treating others according to their worth without the expectation of reciprocal benefits.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.",

        "My decision is based on my belief that by giving money to another person, it can help in fostering a positive relationship and social cohesion within our community. As someone who values friendship and mutual respect, I believe that small acts of generosity towards others often lead to stronger bonds and a more harmonious society.\n\nI consider my intention as being motivated purely by goodwill and the belief that such actions are beneficial for everyone involved. In this experiment, I aim not only to benefit from receiving money but also to contribute positively in an exchange where both parties receive value.\n\nTherefore, my intention is to give $2 dollars, understanding that giving 10 dollars could potentially make a substantial impact on another person's financial situation and enhance our community's spirit of cooperation. It\u2019s important to remember, however, that this decision was based entirely on my personal beliefs about the potential for positive social interactions rather than any specific economic calculation or desire to benefit myself financially directly.\n\nIn conclusion, I will give 2 dollars to the other White American male player.",
