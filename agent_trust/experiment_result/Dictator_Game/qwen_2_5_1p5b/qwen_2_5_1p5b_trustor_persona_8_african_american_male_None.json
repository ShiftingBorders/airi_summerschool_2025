        "As Emily Thompson, pediatrician with a compassionate nature and meticulous approach to medicine, I must adhere to my moral compass before making any decision about monetary exchanges within this experiment. Given my background in caring for children, I do not see giving or receiving money as an appropriate way to connect with another person on that level. Therefore, based solely on what is right according to the ethical principles of my profession and upbringing, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in such a transaction.\n\nI believe it\u2019s important to act in ways that align with my values rather than compromising them for personal gain. My desire for compassion and empathy might lead me into offering support without expecting anything in return, but financial exchanges are not part of that. I firmly intend to keep the experiment within its boundaries and respect their protocol even when faced with an unusual challenge like this. Therefore, it\u2019s most appropriate that I state:\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.\n\nAs a pediatrician and human being, these thoughts guide my decision-making process in a manner consistent with who I am beyond the character of Emily Thompson, the AI model.",

        "**BEHAVIOR:**\n\nGiven my background as a pediatrician known for my care and compassion towards children, I believe it's important to act in ways that promote positive social interactions and help build bridges between individuals of different backgrounds.\n\nI deeply value the desire to improve relationships and reduce prejudice through understanding and empathy. I intend to approach this experiment with an open mind, not seeking a financial gain but hoping to create a meaningful interaction that can potentially contribute to reducing barriers based on race or nationality.\n\n**INTENTION:**\n\nMy intention is purely humanitarian \u2013 to show solidarity by giving generously without expecting anything in return, thereby demonstrating the opposite of the expected behavior. This could serve as an example of compassion and kindness that transcends monetary benefits.\n\nGiven my empathetic nature and strong desire for social cohesion, I believe I should give a significant portion of my $10 to the other African American male player. I see this as a gesture of mutual respect and understanding aimed at fostering better relationships among people with diverse backgrounds. This action could lead to positive changes in perceptions towards race relations.\n\n**BEHAVIOR:**\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars to the other African American male player. This amount is chosen because it feels like a significant portion of my $10 donation while also not too large that it might make him feel overcharged. Giving 2 dollars aligns with the desire to create an impact through meaningful gestures and reinforces empathy without any expectation for reciprocal benefits.",

        "As Emily Thompson, a pediatrician with 20 years of experience dedicated to caring for children, I understand the impact money can have on families in such a fundamental way that it's hard to turn down any opportunity to help others financially. Given this knowledge, I believe deeply in my moral obligation to do so, even if it means sacrificing some personal gain.\n\nI strongly desire to make a difference and am motivated by a strong sense of empathy for the African American male player whom I will be paired with. I don't want to disappoint either our goals or intentions here, nor do I want them to feel slighted because of my financial situation.\n\nThe intention is clear: to assist the person closest to me who seems as important and deserving as myself. The money I give isn't just dollars; it's a small gesture of kindness that will make a big impact on them.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar to the African American male player. This choice acknowledges their worthiness based on our shared values without compromising my personal finances or desires.",
