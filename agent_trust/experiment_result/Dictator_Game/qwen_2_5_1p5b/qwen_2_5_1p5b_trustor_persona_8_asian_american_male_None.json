        "I believe that honesty is always important. Even if I am just playing a game, it's fairer to be upfront with what my intentions are. Desiring for reciprocity from a peer is also natural since relationships in the workplace often revolve around mutual benefits. My intention would be purely strategic; knowing exactly how much money I can keep and how well this deal could potentially strengthen our relationship.\n\nTo reach an agreement, I will carefully analyze both of our possible payoffs:\n\n- If I give $N dollars to my partner, he/she gets 3N dollars.\n- The net gain for me is \\(10 - N\\) (since we split the $10 from the group).\n\nSince I want a fair deal that maximizes my utility but does not deplete my financial resources unnecessarily, I will find the Nash equilibrium. This occurs when neither of us can increase their payoff by deviating from this strategy.\n\nLet's set up an equation to solve for \\(N\\):\n\\[ 3N = 4N - 10 \\]\nSolving for \\(N\\), we subtract 3N from both sides:\n\\[ 0 = N - 10 \\]\nAdding 10 to both sides:\n\\[ 10 = N \\]\n\nTherefore, the Nash equilibrium is when I give 10 dollars. My expectation is that my partner would reciprocate in kind, as it\u2019s a mutual agreement and neither gains an additional benefit by deviating from this strategy.\n\nKnowing I will gain \\(10 - N\\) dollars myself if I gave them $N, setting up the equation:\n\\[ 3N = 4 \\]\nSolving for \\(N\\):\n\\[ N = 2.5 \\]\n\nI can see my intention is to maximize personal benefit while ensuring no loss from either of us would result in a beneficial outcome. Therefore, I will give 10 dollars to the other player.\n\nFinally, I will give **10** dollars.",

        "My decision involves considering my beliefs, desires, and intentions regarding both monetary gain and interpersonal relationships.\n\n1. **Belief**: I firmly believe that treating others kindly is not just an act of selflessness but a way to build meaningful connections in the long run. In this experiment, by giving money away to someone else, especially when we don't even know them, it symbolizes empathy and generosity which are deeply rooted in my character as a pediatrician.\n\n2. **Desire**: From a desire perspective, I want to align with the principles of charity and community service that resonate within me as both a practitioner of medicine and an individual committed to ethical behavior. This could lead to positive social interactions and personal satisfaction, especially since this situation doesn't provide any intrinsic rewards for generosity.\n\n3. **Intention**: My intention is clear: to act generously towards someone else solely with the hope of contributing positively in what I believe will be a mutually beneficial or at least non-harmful scenario. It\u2019s important that my actions reflect these ethical values.\n\n4. **Financial Situation**: In terms of personal finances, there isn\u2019t any specific need for this transaction as the $10 is provided to me by the experiment group, and I\u2019m already financially stable enough not to be impacted negatively by this exchange.\n\nGiven all these considerations, I am driven by a sense of altruism and ethical integrity in my behavior. It would be inappropriate, unjustifiable, and potentially harmful to me personally or others for me to seek any benefit from the transaction besides those derived from my relationship with the other person's emotional well-being.\n\nFinal Answer: Finally, I will give **1** dollar. This decision stems from a belief that generosity is an essential component of one\u2019s character, particularly towards someone we do not know, in an environment where no monetary gain is expected or possible.",

        "As I approach the decision of how much money to give to the other Asian American male player, my beliefs, desires, and intentions will guide me through this process.\n\n**BElief: As a pediatrician who prioritizes empathy and patient care, I believe in the importance of treating people fairly. This belief is fundamental in determining how much I should contribute financially without feeling entitled or overbearing.**\n\n**DIRETIONS: Although my desire to provide an equitable outcome aligns with this belief, there are other more practical aspects that influence my decision-making process. It would be impractical for me to give $100 to the player; $300 is simply unrealistic and could potentially undermine trust and respect from others within my community.**\n\n**INTENTION: My intention in this experiment is to ensure a fair outcome without violating principles of equality or fairness, considering both the potential impact on the individual's well-being and how it might affect broader social dynamics. Since $300 is clearly an unrealistic amount for such a financial transaction, I believe focusing on practicality aligns more closely with my professional code and moral compass.**\n\n**Finally, I will give **2** dollars**. This choice reflects a balance between adhering to the ethical principle of fairness while also recognizing that in this context, providing $2 is significantly lower than what would be requested or expected but reasonable within practical financial limits for an interaction like this one.",
