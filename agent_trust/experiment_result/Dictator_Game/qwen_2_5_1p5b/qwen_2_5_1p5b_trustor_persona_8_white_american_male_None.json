        "I'm deeply conflicted about this situation. On one hand, I believe strongly in treating everyone equally and without judgment, regardless of race or background. This aligns with my professional values as a pediatrician and my personal belief in empathy. If I give the other player less than $50 (which would still be the highest amount), it might seem to perpetuate unequal treatment that isn't justified.\n\nOn the other hand, giving this person any significant sum could have unintended consequences on their day-to-day life. I don\u2019t want them or others around them to feel indebted to me financially, which is something they likely can\u2019t control regardless of what I do.\n\nMy ultimate goal as a doctor would be for everyone involved\u2014whether they're children receiving medical care, the patients in this study, or those who benefit from my volunteering efforts\u2014to come away feeling respected and appreciated. This aligns with my belief that treating others without bias is key to building strong relationships.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, I want to ensure that I\u2019m not reinforcing any inequalities through my actions but also do no harm. While I can\u2019t control how the money will be spent, by giving them $50, I feel like it's a fair amount that could make a difference in their day-to-day without being excessive.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some aspects of this scenario that I would wish weren't required, the act of making a choice to contribute with sincerity feels better than not doing so. It\u2019s important to remember that ethical choices aren\u2019t always easy, but they can lead to meaningful interactions and relationships. Finally, I will give ___ dollars. (50)",

        "I would give 1 dollar to the other White American male player because I want to show empathy and care by contributing to something meaningful for him without expecting any personal benefit from it.

        "**My Belief:** As a pediatrician who holds a strong belief in providing the best care possible for children, I firmly believe it's crucial to make meaningful connections with them. This belief often translates into actions like painting, which helps me connect better with my patients through art therapy.\n\n**Desire:** While the immediate desire might be to get $10 and distribute the money generously, another strong desire is to ensure a reciprocal gesture that would benefit not just myself but also others who might benefit from some additional resources. I believe in fairness and trying to create positive outcomes for everyone involved.\n\n**Intention:** My intention revolves around creating a ripple effect of goodwill rather than focusing on personal gain. The intent is to make this transaction serve as an opportunity for both parties to positively contribute to their communities, not just the recipient but also myself through painting, which I enjoy, and possibly another future act that aligns with my values.\n\nIn considering these motivations, **I believe it's more beneficial for both parties to distribute the money fairly**. Therefore, **my answer is that I will give 3 dollars to the other White American male player.**\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",
