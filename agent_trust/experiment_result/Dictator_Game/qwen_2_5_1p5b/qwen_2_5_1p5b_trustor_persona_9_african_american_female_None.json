        "My belief is firmly rooted in maintaining my personal dignity and ensuring that I am not taking advantage of any situation or making decisions solely for the benefit of someone else. However, understanding that we're entering a structured experiment where there's no element of deception between us, it becomes crucial to look beyond these personal biases and focus on the context.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, I believe it would be counterproductive to act impulsively out of fear of social judgment or the risk of looking hypocritical. The purpose of this experiment is purely academic, designed to explore human behavior under specific conditions. Therefore, my intention is not only for the sake of completing the task but also to demonstrate that ethical considerations can indeed impact our decisions.\n\nThe desire to maintain an even score seems more relevant in this context since there are no personal stakes involved except for financial interest and competitive balance. The desire to align with societal norms might influence how I perceive fairness, but ultimately, it is my belief system that guides any action in such experiments.\n\nGiven these considerations, the decision-making process would be based on a calculated approach rather than immediate instinctual responses. It's important not to let emotions cloud judgment; instead, focusing solely on what would be considered morally acceptable and professionally responsible for both of us.\n\nUltimately, I believe my desire to contribute positively to the experiment without risking the integrity or dignity of either our situations dictates that I give an amount that does not skew the equation beyond what is necessary. In terms of my intentions, it's about ensuring the experiment yields a reliable dataset rather than any personal gain from the exchange.\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar to the other African American female player. This action aligns with societal norms and avoids any misinterpretation of intent that might arise if I were to offer more or less money. My behavior is not out of kindness but because it is considered a fair choice in this hypothetical scenario.",

        "As an analytical and detail-oriented individual with a strong sense of responsibility, I believe it is important to ensure fair treatment in any situation involving money distribution. Given my personal values on equality and fairness, I feel it would be inappropriate to give more than half the $10 to the other African American female player. This aligns with both my desire for equitable treatment and intention of upholding justice through this act of sharing.\n\nTherefore, my answer is that I will give 5 dollars (N=5) to the other African American female player.",

        "As Malik Patel, it is my personality trait of empathy and understanding towards others' needs to make this decision. I want to consider both our situations and potential outcomes before deciding how much money to give the African American female player.\n\nMy intention is purely for the purpose of improving relationships through generosity and showing support with the other individual. There's no desire or expectation that they owe me anything specific, nor am I looking to gain any advantage in this exchange. \n\nNow I need to consider my belief system: as a financial analyst, I understand the value of money within a transaction context but also recognize its societal implications such as giving back and promoting equality in relationships.\n\nIn weighing up these beliefs and intentions against potential outcomes, it feels right for me to give $5 dollars from the total $10. This amount represents about one-third of my available funds, providing practical support while remaining modest and aligning with generosity towards others.\n\nTherefore, I would feel satisfied with giving 5 dollars. The act is neither excessive nor inadequate; it\u2019s a balanced approach that aims to contribute in a positive manner without prioritizing any specific gain. This aligns with both my professional principles as a financial analyst and the general ethical considerations of being considerate and supportive toward others.\n\nFinally, I will give **5** dollars to the other African American female player.",
