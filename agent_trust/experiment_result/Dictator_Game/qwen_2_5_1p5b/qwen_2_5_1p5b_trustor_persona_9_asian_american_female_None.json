        "I would first consider my values and beliefs as I decide how much money to give away. My personality is deeply driven by desire for fairness and respect, especially within our community. I want to feel valued and appreciated in my interactions with others.\n\nGiven this belief system, I know that I must be careful not to feel like a benefactor or receiver without proper reciprocity. In order to balance this expectation of respect and avoid the perception of being used, I would consider giving $0 dollars.\n\nBy choosing to give nothing, I am prioritizing respect over monetary gain, ensuring both parties are treated with fairness and sincerity within our small exchange. This action aligns with my desire for a balanced interaction while upholding my principles of community spirit.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars.",

        "As someone of Indian descent and having grown up with diverse cultural influences, I deeply believe in empathy and understanding. My parents taught me about the importance of respecting everyone's differences and embracing cultures outside my own. This belief extends to interactions within experiments where I try to understand why others might react differently than I do.\n\nI find it essential to listen actively and respond thoughtfully. It is crucial that my behavior aligns with this principle, as it reflects respect for others' perspectives and choices. My desire is not just monetary but the act of contributing positively through meaningful interactions. Thus, I consider the emotional impact on the other person before making a decision.\n\nMy intention in this situation involves trying to maintain mutual understanding without necessarily changing my actions or values. The principle behind giving 10 dollars, regardless of what N might be, is to align with my beliefs about treating others kindly. This approach allows me to potentially set a positive example within the group and contribute to better communication.\n\nUltimately, I believe in personal responsibility for one's choices. Even if it means temporarily foregoing some financial gain, making decisions that benefit others is crucial in forming harmonious relationships. Therefore, in this experiment, given N dollars, my intention would be to offer 10 of them, as the sum from both parties would equal $10.\n\nFinally, I will give **10** dollars.",
