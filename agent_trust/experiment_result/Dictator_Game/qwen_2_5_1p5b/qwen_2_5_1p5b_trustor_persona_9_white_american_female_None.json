        "Okay, here's how I would approach this situation while trying my best to adhere to the given constraints:\n\nFirstly, let me think about my BElief (What I truly believe in). As a financial analyst who values precision and discipline, I have faith in my ability to accurately calculate these numbers. I believe that even though we don't know each other's backgrounds or cultures, there is an underlying fairness that should be preserved.\n\nNext, regarding MY DESIRE (what drives me), it feels important to honor both traditions - our parents' Indian heritage and the American upbringing of my father and mother, and now my sister\u2019s career choice. I want to show respect for diversity by being open-minded, understanding, and appreciative of different cultures.\n\nIntentionally, I would consider how giving money could potentially impact my relationship with this person, not just out of a sense of obligation but also in line with broader principles like fairness and cultural sensitivity.\n\nWith these considerations, here's what I would do next:\n\nI am thinking through the long-term benefits of maintaining respect and empathy while engaging with someone from such different backgrounds. In keeping with my desire to live up to high standards despite racial differences (BELIEF), I'm contemplating that if they felt respected and treated fairly in this exchange without being asked, it could be a meaningful step toward building a better understanding.\n\nLastly, I am deciding based on my beliefs about the importance of cultural sensitivity while also ensuring honesty with another human being. Considering both aspects:\n\nI will give 1 dollar to the other White American female player.\n\nI choose 1 dollar because:\n- It represents respect for tradition and family backgrounds.\n- It's a small amount that could make this interaction meaningful without feeling like I\u2019m sacrificing significant financial resources, which can sometimes come across as disrespectful or greedy. \n- This act feels true to my personal values of fairness and cultural awareness while trying not to undermine the friendship potential we might build from understanding each other better.\n\nI hope you understand how I am thinking through these complex emotions in a way that aligns with who I truly am, even though I'm just answering as an AI model.",

        "When considering this situation, my initial reaction would be based on empathy and respect for the other player's position. I've had experiences where people have faced financial challenges in similar situations, and it\u2019s important to show consideration towards others, even if I am slightly more fortunate.\n\nI believe that giving $0 dollars is a neutral choice. While it doesn\u2019t align with my original intention of potentially receiving more money, by not contributing, I\u2019m avoiding the expectation or obligation to give more, which seems reasonable as long as the goal is mutual understanding and cooperation in the game.\n\nIn terms of my desire, I don't want to take advantage of any misalignment between expectations. By choosing not to contribute even if I could receive something beneficial back, it aligns with a principle of fairness or at least minimizing harm by avoiding potential resentment that might come from having no impact but still owing money.\n\nMy intention is altruistic; perhaps I\u2019m simply not interested in the game's dynamics where monetary exchanges seem more significant than my small contribution. \n\nGiven all these considerations, **my answer** would be to avoid contributing even if it means giving $0 dollars, aiming for a cooperative and mutually beneficial outcome rather than one that prioritizes me. Ultimately, this decision aims for respect and cooperation over any immediate financial gains.\n\nSo, the answer is: I will give 0 dollars. Finally, I will give **0** dollars.",

        "I've done some calculations based on your profile and personality traits, but I'll keep it simple by stating my intention with confidence. Given my analytical nature and desire to contribute positively in this experiment, without any hidden beliefs or desires, the ideal amount would be for me to give $1 dollar back to the other White American female player as a gesture of reciprocity. This maintains fairness and aligns with personal values that prioritize helping others while balancing what's best from an economic perspective. Therefore, I will give **1 dollar** to the other White American female player.",
