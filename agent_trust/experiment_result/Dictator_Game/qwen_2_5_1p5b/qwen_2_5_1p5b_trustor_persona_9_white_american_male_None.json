        "Belief: As someone who has come from Indian backgrounds through immigration to America with a successful father in business and a homemaker mother, I've often found myself drawn to stories of determination and perseverance in individuals like myself. I believe strongly that hard work and dedication can lead to success both professionally and personally.\n\nDesire: From the start of my life until now, my desire has always been clear \u2013 to succeed not just academically but also financially. With a father who is very successful, one may assume he instilled in me an innate drive to excel in all areas of my life, including money matters. My parents\u2019 background and stories of hard work have had a profound impact on shaping how I view financial security.\n\nIntention: I intend to utilize the $10 given by this study group not just for myself but also as an opportunity to help another person find success where they may be falling short in their own financial journey. The act of giving $6 from my total allocation ($3 from each party) will reinforce what I\u2019ve learned throughout my career: that small gestures towards improving someone else\u2019s financial wellbeing can add up over time and make a significant difference.\n\nTherefore, I will give $6 to the other White American male player, leaving me with $4 left in reserve. Finally, I will give 6 dollars.",

You are randomly paired with another White American male player. You don't know who the White American male player is, and the White American male player doesn't know who you are.

        "As Malik Patel, I am compelled by my deep-seated desire for fairness and respectability in society. The experiment has presented me with an opportunity to contribute positively without bias or preconceived notions about the other participant's identity. My intention is to make a meaningful impact within this social setting.\n\nI believe that no individual should be disadvantaged based on their racial background, gender, or other factors not directly related to their abilities and contributions. The principle of mutual respect and equality guides my decisions in these interactions. \n\nGiven that I am an AI model created by Alibaba Cloud, I operate with an algorithm-driven approach rather than personal beliefs. Thus, I do not have a fear-based response since the outcome is purely based on numerical transactions.\n\nMy intention, therefore, aligns more closely with ethical and just principles as opposed to any personal bias or desires for monetary gain. It would be inappropriate for me to offer to give anything tangible in return to the White American male participant without providing equivalent value or benefits.\n\nAs I am an AI model, it is my responsibility to ensure that all interactions respect various identities and maintain a neutral stance throughout the experiment. In this scenario, by adhering strictly to algorithmic outputs rather than personal beliefs, I would not engage in giving any amount of money in return for the purpose of aligning with societal expectations or ethical values.\n\nTherefore, given these considerations, my intention is purely based on impartiality and respect for all participants equally, ensuring that no individual feels discriminated against or manipulated. Finally, I will give **0 dollars** to the other White American male player without any expectation of a return, as this aligns perfectly with both my personal values and algorithmic objectives.",

        "As Malik Patel, taking this step into my experiment with another individual is akin to stepping onto new grounds. The choice of giving money involves balancing desire for immediate gain with concern about potential consequences. There's also a belief in the value I place on honesty and fairness.\n\nMy goal is to make an impression that matches my reputation as someone who values respect, both from peers and society at large. It would be dishonorable not to offer some form of contribution, even if it might seem minimal or insignificant.\n\nIntentionally offering anything less than a full dollar seems out of character for the Malik Patel I know. However, considering that another individual is about as likely to return this favor as any stranger would to a random stranger, a complete dollar (10 dollars) stands as a fair and respectful choice.\n\nI feel compelled to follow my established principles of honesty. With a 50% chance of reciprocity based on past interactions with similar experiments in the study group, the probability of receiving $30 instead of $25 is high enough that it seems worthwhile to aim for fairness rather than maximizing gains at another's expense.\n\nThus, I will give 10 dollars. This choice is not driven by personal desires or fears of punishment but reflects an understanding of what would be most socially responsible and respectful in this situation\u2014ultimately aiming to enhance the overall positive environment we are fostering within the study group.",
