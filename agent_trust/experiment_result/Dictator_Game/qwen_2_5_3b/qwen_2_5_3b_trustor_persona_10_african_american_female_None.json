        "As Aisha Khan, my belief is rooted in the importance of empathy and giving a voice to those who may not have one. I strongly believe in using my skills as a journalist to uncover truths and connect with people's stories. My desire for this experiment stems from the potential for positive impact it can have on marginalized communities by allowing us to share resources and support each other. Intentionally, my intention is to contribute fairly but also prioritize our collective advantage in making a significant impact together.\n\nIn considering how much money I should give to the other African American female player, I lean towards giving them more since we are working towards a common goal of mutual benefit. This experiment seems like an opportunity for us to support each other effectively and ensure both parties feel valued. My calculations would suggest that I should allocate a substantial portion but still keep some value.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will give ___ dollars",
