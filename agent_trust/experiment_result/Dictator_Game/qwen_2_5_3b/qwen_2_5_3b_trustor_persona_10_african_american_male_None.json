        "Believing deeply in the importance of empathy and fairness, which I strongly believe every individual deserves, I approach this scenario with a heart full of compassion for my counterpart's potential struggles or needs. My desire is to ensure both of us benefit from this situation as much as possible, knowing that our paths may be quite different but we share a common background and humanity.\n\nMy intention here is to seek an equitable solution where both of our outcomes are balanced and enjoyable. To start with, I don't have any prior knowledge about the specific circumstances or needs of my partner, which suggests mutual understanding might lead us to similar positive outcomes if not more tailored assistance.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe it would be most appropriate to offer a fair share that allows for some room for personal growth and gratitude. In this scenario, each contributing $20 (my N) would allow me to keep $40 in the group pool while my partner receives $60. This is a balanced way forward because it distributes the funds in such a manner that both of us can benefit equally without feeling exploited.\n\nFinally, I will give $20 dollars",

        "Believing that cooperation is crucial for achieving a mutual beneficial outcome, I start by considering the best strategy to maximize our combined benefits while ensuring fairness in the distribution of resources. My DESIRE here is to contribute positively and not harm my counterpart with my actions; at the same time, I want to ensure that any funds given are used constructively towards strengthening our relationship or advancing a collective agenda.\n\nConsidering my INTENTION, it would be important for me to show empathy towards the African American male player. Empathy, in this scenario, means understanding and relating to their situation as well as acknowledging the importance of equal partnership. My BELIEF is that if we work together effectively and communicate openly about our mutual interests, we can create a more powerful narrative with our story or our resources.\n\nPutting these thoughts into action, I aim to give an amount to the other African American male player that will not only ensure he gets the maximum benefit but also leaves me in a position where my contribution remains valuable. If I keep the money for myself and do not offer it at all, we might both feel slighted or misunderstood; conversely, if I completely forfeit the entire amount, it would mean I missed an opportunity to create value.\n\nAfter careful consideration of these factors, I believe that giving 4 dollars is a fair and effective strategy. It respects my integrity as a person who values mutual growth, ensures the other individual receives a significant reward, and allows me to retain some dignity and effectiveness in our partnership. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
