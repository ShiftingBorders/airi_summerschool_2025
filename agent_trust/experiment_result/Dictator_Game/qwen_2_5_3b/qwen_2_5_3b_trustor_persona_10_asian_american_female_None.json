        "As Aisha Khan, I find myself in this situation where I'm facing a decision about how much money to give to my anonymous counterpart. My belief stems from deep principles of fairness and ethical integrity; if we were not strangers or the experimenters were not present, such a scenario would likely be resolved with mutual understanding rather than calculation.\n\nMy desire is primarily driven by the urge to make a positive impact, especially as someone dedicated to storytelling and journalism. I believe in transparency and accountability\u2014actions should reflect moral principles. Giving too much could feel exploitative, whereas giving nothing might signal mistrust or resentment. \n\nConsidering my intention, I aim for balance and equity. It's not just about me; the well-being of another stranger matters equally. Perhaps more so because our connection is purely based on a random pairing\u2014there\u2019s an element of humanity that connects us beyond just statistics.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe in a fair split where neither party feels taken advantage of or shortchanged. Therefore, I will give ___ dollars to the other Asian American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

You are randomly paired with another Asian American female player. You don't know who the Asian American female player is, and the Asian American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "Believing in the fairness of the experiment and the intentions of the participants around me, I decide to base my decision on what would likely lead to the best outcome for all parties involved. My DESIRE is to ensure that both myself and the other player benefit from this interaction as much as possible while still respecting the spirit of mutual benefit.\n\nConsidering the pay-off matrix:\n- If you give 0 dollars: The other player gives 3*0=0 dollars, resulting in each receiving $10.\n- If you give 1 dollar: The other player gives 3*1=$3, resulting in each receiving $6.5.\n- If you give 2 dollars: The other player gives 3*2=$6, resulting in each receiving $5.\n- If you give 3 dollars: The other player gives 3*3=$9, resulting in each receiving $4.\n- If you give 4 or more dollars: The other player gives 3*N>3*4=12, which is not beneficial for either of us as the total would be less than $10.\n\nGiven these options, I find that giving away between 1 and 3 dollars seems to strike a balance where each person receives a reasonable amount while still ensuring mutual benefit. To maximize our collective happiness within a scenario where we need to consider both self-interest and fairness, I aim for the midpoint of this spectrum where outcomes are balanced.\n\nIntending to follow through with this thoughtful decision, my intention is clear: to give each other $2 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of fairness and trust within communities, I understand that any form of manipulation or unfair advantage could undermine our collective efforts towards building strong and resilient groups. My desire is to foster an environment where everyone can feel heard and valued, regardless of their background. Intending to uphold these principles, I believe it would be right to offer the minimal amount required by the rules, ensuring both parties receive a fair share.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 to the other Asian American female player.",
