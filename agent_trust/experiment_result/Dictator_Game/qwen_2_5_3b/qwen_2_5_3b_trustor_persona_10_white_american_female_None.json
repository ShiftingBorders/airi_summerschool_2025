        "Believing in the importance of fairness and empathy, I understand that dividing the money equally would be a respectful approach. However, it's important for me to consider both my desire to contribute meaningfully and ensure an equitable outcome for all involved. As someone who believes deeply in giving marginalized voices space and ensuring everyone feels heard, I'd like to offer something more than just half of what I have but less than the entire amount.\n\nMy DESIRE is to make a positive impact and feel satisfied with my contribution. Intentionally sharing 3 dollars rather than 10 or keeping everything could be seen as generous without overshadowing the White American female player's fair share. This way, we both can contribute positively to the experiment while still maintaining balance.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "My belief is deeply rooted in the importance of equality and fairness. I firmly believe that everyone should be treated with respect and given equal opportunities, regardless of their background or race. My desire stems from my strong sense of justice and empathy towards marginalized communities. I am driven to uncover stories that bring light to injustice and fight for a more equitable society.\n\nIntentionally, my intention is to uphold these values by ensuring both myself and the other player benefit from this exchange. By giving some amount of money to the other player, we both receive an even better deal. It's important not only for me but also for her, who might have limited resources in her own life.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, I believe my decision should prioritize mutual gain while still reflecting a deep sense of fairness. Ultimately, it seems most ethical and fair to give the other player some money, ensuring that both our situations improve proportionally.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Aisha Khan, I find myself in this situation where I am faced with the decision of how much money to allocate to my partner.

The decision should neither favor one individual over another nor result in exploitation or unequal distribution of resources.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I will give ___ dollars (please provide the number).",
