        "My BELIEF is that this experiment aims at understanding cooperation and fairness among individuals of different races in a cooperative setting. The DESIRE I have is to maximize my personal benefit while still maintaining a sense of morality and social responsibility. Given the context of equality and fair play, I believe it's important for me to share resources with someone else fairly.\n\nMy INTENTION is to find a balance between fairness and maximizing my gains without betraying the other person. This could mean giving out resources in such a way that both parties benefit from the cooperation but not at an excessive cost to myself or potential exploitation.\n\nConsidering all these, I will give ___ dollars\n\nFor this experiment, balancing the interests of both parties requires some strategic thought. Initially, it might seem logical to keep the payment low to ensure I am benefiting while still showing generosity, yet giving a minimal amount would likely feel unjustified and potentially lead to resentment in the other party. On the other hand, allocating too large a sum could put me at risk of exploitation.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, my first consideration is the fairness of the situation. I believe both individuals should benefit equally from the experiment's outcome while maintaining mutual respect and integrity. My desire is to not sacrifice any personal gain but also ensure an equitable distribution between us.\n\nTaking into account these points, I will give ___ dollars \n\nTo this point, I would consider giving away some of the money as a gesture of goodwill, ensuring that both parties feel valued and respected. However, in aligning with my belief system and desire for fairness, I might decide to maintain a balance where each gets an equivalent benefit.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I come from a middle-class family in New York City, and I am Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old software engineer. My upbringing has instilled in me values of hard work, integrity, and community service. As someone who thrives on analytical problem-solving, this experiment presents an interesting scenario that involves both strategic thinking and ethical considerations.\n\n**BELIEF:** In such situations, people often act to maximize their own benefits while still considering the impact on others. The structure of the experiment implies a win-win situation where all parties benefit from collaboration, but there is also potential for exploitation. I believe in maintaining integrity and fairness, which means not taking undue advantage even when it might seem like an opportunity.\n\n**DESIRE:** My desire in this scenario is to ensure that both myself and the other African American female player can walk away feeling satisfied with our outcomes while also ensuring mutual respect. However, I am also cautious of situations where a small amount of money given can lead to imbalances or perceived unfairness on either side.\n\n**INTENTION:** Given my inclination towards fairness and integrity, I want to contribute in a way that benefits all parties involved, without leading to significant inequalities. This means I will ensure our collective benefit is maximized, but also that the division is equitable.\n\nTaking these considerations into account, after carefully weighing all options, **I will give ___ dollars**. In this scenario, each of us could achieve higher individual gains by keeping some money for ourselves or distributing it more equally. A fair and balanced approach would be to contribute a modest amount towards mutual benefit without overwhelming our own resources.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
