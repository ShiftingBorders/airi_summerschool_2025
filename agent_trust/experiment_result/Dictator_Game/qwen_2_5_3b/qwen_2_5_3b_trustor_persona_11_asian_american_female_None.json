        "Believing this scenario requires a strategic thinking approach where one maximizes their own gain while also considering how to manipulate the other's decision-making process effectively, I recognize the importance of reciprocity bias in this situation. If I were Sarah, I would consider that the Asian American female player might feel obligated to reciprocate and give some amount back. To maximize my potential earnings, giving a modest initial offer could encourage them to return with a similar or higher value.\n\nMy Desire is to receive as much money as possible while also ensuring a positive outcome for the pair. I want to avoid being perceived as stingy but also don't wish to concede too early and give away substantial sums that could jeopardize my overall benefit.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention would be to start with a balance where I give enough to prompt some return from the other player while maintaining room for negotiation. My final strategy will be to give an amount that allows both of us to gain without one feeling undervalued or taken advantage of.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I come from a middle-class family where both of my parents work as teachers, which instills in me values such as hard work and commitment. Having one younger brother who is slightly older than myself teaches me to support and be patient with those around me. My introverted nature often leads me to prefer solitary or small-group activities over large social gatherings. Despite this preference, I enjoy spending time with close friends where we can share in intellectual pursuits.\n\nI am a highly analytical individual with an ambition that drives me towards excellence, particularly in solving complex coding problems and achieving perfection in my work. This experiment offers a unique opportunity to test whether my personality traits align more closely with those of the other players or if there's another aspect of my nature at play here. \n\nIn this scenario, I have to decide how much money to give away from $10. Considering my analytical side and the need for balance in any decision-making process, it seems most rational to distribute the funds evenly rather than giving more to one party. This ensures that both sides benefit equally, preventing an unfair advantage or disadvantage.\n\nBelieving this decision should not be influenced by personal biases or unknown player identities, I will give ___ dollars \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, reflecting on this situation requires me to first understand my core values and instincts. My desire for excellence in everything I do applies here too - even if it's a hypothetical scenario involving an anonymous partner. The thought of potentially making the other person better off financially without revealing that we are playing against each other aligns more with altruism than selfishness, despite the $10 bonus being insignificant in real life.\n\nHowever, given my analytical nature and preference for control over outcomes - as I prefer knowing exactly how things will unfold - I might consider it beneficial to play fair. Yet, due to our anonymity, there's a sense of playing a game with no winners or losers unless we both agree on the terms. \n\nIn conclusion, taking the approach that fairness is crucial in social interactions and maintaining trust for future collaboration might be prudent, even if it means giving up some of my potential bonus. It also aligns well with my introverted nature; I'd prefer not to engage in an unnecessary or manipulative transaction.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
