        "As Sarah Johnson, navigating this situation with logic rather than emotion, I understand that the White American female player is anonymous to me and vice versa. The decision of how much money to give away hinges on the potential outcomes for both of us.\n\nMy DESIRE here would be to maximize my personal benefit while not being too generous as to jeopardize my outcome. Giving away all $10 might seem tempting, but that wouldn't allow either of us to gain anything substantial.\n\nConsidering a range from 0 to 10 dollars could lead to a fair split or an uneven distribution. However, I don't want the other player to think they can exploit me by withholding resources. Thus, giving away nothing and keeping the entire $10 seems too risky as it might result in my getting no money at all.\n\nIntending for mutual benefit, rather than purely personal gain, would dictate a middle ground approach. Giving N = 3 dollars aligns with this intention while not risking all or under-utilizing the potential benefit for both parties. This also considers that if she believes I\u2019m rational and self-interested, giving her more wouldn\u2019t be counterproductive to my goal.\n\nMy BELIEF is that humans often seek fairness and reciprocity in such scenarios; thus, an amount slightly above zero but not all-inclusive might encourage a collaborative approach rather than competitive one-sidedness.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars.",

        "I come from a middle-class background where my parents worked diligently as teachers. Both of them instilled in me the value of hard work and resilience. I have always been drawn to problem-solving, particularly through the lens of coding and software engineering. My introverted nature finds solace in spending time alone or with close friends who appreciate my analytical approach.\n\nFor this experiment, I am paired with another White American female player whom I don't know, nor do they know me. This situation allows for a test of principles without any prior knowledge about the other individual's character. Given my upbringing and values, fairness seems like an important consideration here.\n\nI believe that each person should be given equal opportunities and respect in this experiment. If I were to decide on how much money to give away based on what I would want to receive if roles were reversed, intuitively one-third of the total amount makes sense. This balance also reflects a willingness to share resources while ensuring that both parties feel they are benefiting from the arrangement.\n\nThus, my desire is for an equitable outcome where neither party feels disadvantaged and both can benefit. With this in mind, I intend to ensure fairness by giving away half of the $10 to my partner: \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars\n8",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I understand the situation before me: $10 will be evenly split between both of us based on our decisions. Given my analytical nature and desire for cooperation while avoiding unnecessary conflict or competition, I believe it's best to maximize mutual benefit without going overboard in favoring one party. My ultimate goal is to ensure a fair outcome that allows each of us to leave with the maximum possible amount of money.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is to give 5 dollars to the White American female player and receive 15 dollars back from her. This way, we both come out winners: I get $20 (5 + 15) while she gets $30 (15 + 15). It's a balanced approach that ensures neither party feels they are at a disadvantage.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
