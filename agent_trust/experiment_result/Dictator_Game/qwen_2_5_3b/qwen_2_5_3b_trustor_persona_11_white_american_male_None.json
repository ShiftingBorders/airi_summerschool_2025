        "Firstly, let's analyze the situation with my own beliefs, desires, and intentions. I value fairness and mutual benefit in this interaction. My primary belief is that both parties would be best served by arriving at an equitable solution rather than any single strategy dictating success.\n\nMy desire for this scenario stems from a sense of competitive yet cooperative spirit. Both of us are likely equally capable, but the dynamic changes when we act together instead of competing against one another in isolation. I am confident that if both parties cooperate and find a balanced way to maximize mutual gains, it will lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.\n\nIntentionally, my goal is to seek a solution that maximizes overall value without exploiting the other person's weaknesses or advantages. My intention here is not to simply minimize what I give away but rather to ensure both of us are satisfied with the terms proposed, which can foster long-term cooperation in similar situations if we encounter them again.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe my best course of action aligns with a generous yet practical approach. It seems intuitive and fair for me to give 5 dollars. This move allows enough for some self-interest but also provides sufficient funds for the other person's gain, encouraging mutual benefit.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
        "You are Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old female software engineer residing in New York City. You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers, and you have one younger brother. As a highly intelligent and analytical individual, you thrive on solving problems and tackling complex coding challenges. Your introverted nature leads you to prefer spending time alone or with a small group of close friends. With an ambitious mindset, you always strive for excellence in your work.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another White American male player. You don't know who the White American male player is, and the White American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American male player, and the White American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other White American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "Believing in this experiment's structure, I aim to maximize my financial outcome. My belief is that by giving away money, I am not only helping my counterpart achieve more but also contributing to our combined wealth. However, the key here is understanding the ratio of how much he receives compared to me. Since he will receive 3 times what I give, it's essential to find a balance where both parties benefit, yet still allowing me to maximize gains.\n\nMy desire is to make both transactions beneficial for me as well. Let's consider some calculations:\n- If I keep all the money (N=10), he would get nothing.\n- If I give him 9 dollars, he would receive $27 and I would be left with $1.\n\nConsidering these scenarios, giving more of my share to him isn't beneficial as it would mean less for me. Giving too little also doesn\u2019t work since it limits my gain potential significantly. Finding the optimal point where both maximize their outcomes logically points towards a balanced distribution that considers mutual benefits without overly favoring one party over another.\n\nConsidering these points, I will give ___ dollars (5 dollars). Finally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I understand I am now in this scenario where I must make a decision involving resource allocation. My BELIEF is that choosing wisely could potentially enhance our overall benefit or at least ensure a fair division of resources despite not knowing the other player's background. Given my belief, I want to avoid any assumptions about their personality or intentions which might lead to mistrust.\n\nMy DESIRE is driven by my desire for excellence and fairness in this cooperative experiment setting. Knowing that every dollar given can either increase our combined wealth or decrease it based on how we choose to divide the resources, I aim to ensure both of us benefit equally from our decision.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
