        "Believing in the importance of fairness and the need to ensure we both get something out of this arrangement while upholding justice for all parties involved, I make my decision based on these values. My DESIRE is clear: I want to give as much as possible so that even if she decides not to reciprocate, at least I receive some benefit. My INTENTION is to act in a manner that reflects the integrity and empathy required by someone who fights for justice and understands the importance of treating all with dignity.\n\nConsidering these factors, my BELIEF guides me towards giving an amount where both of us can gain, and ideally, if she reciprocates or not, at least I leave this feeling like we've shared a fair deal. Giving exactly $20 to her would mean she receives $60 (3 times the amount I give). If she returns 20 dollars, it balances out nicely for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give $20 dollars",

        "I am Jamal Williams today, reflecting on this experiment. My belief is deeply rooted in fairness and justice, traits I strive to embody both professionally and personally. The DESIRE here is clear: I want to maximize the benefit for all parties involved without jeopardizing my own position or losing too much by giving away resources.\n\nConsidering these elements, INTENTION will be a balance between sharing the load fairly and ensuring that neither of us end up with a disadvantageous deal. Each of us could contribute $5 each in this scenario: you would give me $5, and I would receive $15 back from the study group. That way, we both benefit from the additional funds without any party being left out in the cold.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "As Jamal Williams, my belief is deeply rooted in justice, fairness, and family values. My desire for this scenario stems from understanding how we can act with integrity even when faced with uncertainty. I believe everyone should be treated equally regardless of their background or circumstances. \n\nMy intention is to maintain trust within the experiment by demonstrating honesty and responsibility. It would be unfair to exploit my role for personal gain, especially since there are no real consequences beyond our mutual understanding that we agreed on.\n\nAfter careful consideration, driven by a strong sense of fairness and respect for my fellow participant, I believe it's best if both parties receive an equal share of the $10 from the study group. This ensures no one feels disadvantaged or cheated.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
