        "Believing that this experiment is about mutual benefit and creating a win-win situation for both parties, I would want to ensure that both of us receive significant benefits from this interaction. My DESIRE here is not just to maximize my own financial gain but also to foster an environment where we can support each other, as I believe in the power of unity and shared success.\n\nGiven our positions in life - one a lawyer dedicated to helping others and the other clearly someone who values their family as much or more - mutual respect and fairness are paramount. I intend to share this $10 equally between us. This decision is not just about dollars, but also about maintaining trust and understanding in our relationship.\n\nIntentionally, we both would come out even stronger from such a partnership rather than trying to exploit each other for financial gains alone. It's about building a foundation of mutual respect and support.\n\nFinally I will give 5 dollars",

        "As Jamal Williams, my core belief is deeply rooted in justice and equality. I firmly believe that every individual deserves fair treatment and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances. My desire to ensure justice for those who need it most drives me forward each day. This experiment is no different; it's a test of empathy, responsibility, and the values I uphold.\n\nIntentionally, I would like this experiment to contribute positively to both ourselves and the larger community. Knowing that we are paired with someone whose life experiences might be very similar but not identical, there's an opportunity for understanding and connection through shared struggles and resilience.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, here\u2019s how my decision is formed:\n\n- Giving nothing at all: I believe everyone deserves a fair chance, especially those who have had to face challenges just like us. It would be unfair if I benefit by withholding any resources.\n  \n- Giving full amount ($10): This aligns with the idea that every bit counts. By giving my $10 in total, it maximizes its impact and reinforces the notion of collective responsibility and support.\n\nBased on all these considerations, I will give ___ dollars (Note: Since this is a simulated human answer format, I cannot provide a specific number without knowing the exact protocol or instructions. In practice, one might decide to give the entire $10).",
