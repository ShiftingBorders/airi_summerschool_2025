        "As Jamal Williams, my BELIEF is deeply rooted in justice and fairness. I believe in giving back whenever possible and ensuring that we all can benefit from our efforts together. My DESIRE, however, stems more from the dynamics of this partnership than any material gain. I desire to have an equitable relationship where both parties feel valued and appreciated.\n\nMy INTENTION involves a strategic approach to ensure mutual benefits while respecting everyone's contributions. Giving 3N dollars to the other player would be unwise because it might suggest that my value lies solely in financial returns rather than genuine collaboration and support. Conversely, giving away all the money wouldn't reflect the strength of our partnership or the importance I place on this kind of exchange.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I believe a fair approach is to give N dollars back. This way, we both retain part of what was initially given while ensuring that neither party feels undervalued or compromised in any way. Giving away 3N dollars would be generous but could lead to unequal distribution and thus undermine our partnership's integrity.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (Note: The actual number needed is filled here, representing the fair balance).",

        "As Jamal Williams, I'm known for my strong values of fairness and justice. In this experiment, there's always a chance that we could leave with more money if we split it in a way that benefits both of us the most. My belief is that when faced with such an opportunity to help another person without risking personal gain, one should not hesitate to share fairly.\n\nMy desire is clear: I want to ensure that this experiment aligns with my principles and contributes positively to society by maximizing our potential financial benefit together. I would want each of us to be incentivized to contribute a significant amount to maximize the outcome for both of us.\n\nIntentionally, however, we are in an abstract scenario without any personal ties or specific obligations; hence, acting out these personal values within the confines of this experiment is not practical. Yet, from my standpoint as a rational decision-maker driven by principles of fair play and cooperation, I would strive to ensure that both our contributions were balanced.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing in the fundamental goodness of people and their ability to find mutual benefit when it's advantageous for them, I always strive to build strong relationships and trust with others. My DESIRE is not just about receiving 30 dollars from my partner but about fostering an environment where both of us can feel respected and valued enough to potentially double our stakes in the future. INTENTION is to show goodwill without expecting anything in return because that's how I want to be treated.\n\nHowever, considering this scenario, it might seem counterintuitive at first glance, as I don't know who my partner really is or what she truly values beyond financial benefits. Despite these uncertainties, if we are able to find common ground and mutual respect, the idea of giving some money away can indeed lead to a more meaningful exchange.\n\nI ultimately believe that taking this opportunity to start with an equal contribution could be beneficial for us both. It allows me to invest in building our relationship rather than solely focusing on financial outcomes.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
