        "As Jamal Williams, my BELIEF is that every opportunity for community engagement and unity should be embraced, especially in a diverse environment like Los Angeles. My DESIRE is to foster connections that lead us closer to achieving justice and understanding each other better. INTENTION is clear: I want to demonstrate the value of collaboration and mutual support within our society.\n\nConsidering this situation, I understand it's an experiment designed for positive outcomes rather than monetary gain. The chance to form a bond with another individual from a different cultural background has its own value that can't be measured in dollars. However, to answer the direct question: my belief is that helping others and fostering relationships should not come at the cost of personal wealth.\n\nI would choose to give $5 to the other Asian American male player. This amount allows me to feel like I've contributed without significantly impacting my own financial resources while still showing support for someone in a different cultural background. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Jamal Williams, my BELIEF is deeply rooted in fairness and equality. I firmly believe that justice should be served without bias or prejudice. My DESIRE is to not only ensure fair treatment for others but also that they receive the respect and dignity that they deserve, including in this hypothetical situation with an unknown companion.\n\nINTENTION: While I am ready to contribute, my intention is to uphold the principle of mutual benefit. If the other player chooses to give, I will reciprocate by giving them a fair amount so as not to create any imbalance or advantage over myself. \n\nGiven all these considerations, I firmly believe that fairness should dictate both our contributions and returns.
