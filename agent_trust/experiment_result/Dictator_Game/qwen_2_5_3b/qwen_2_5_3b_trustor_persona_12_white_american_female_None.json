        "Firstly, let's consider my position here. I am Jamal Williams, a lawyer deeply committed to justice and fairness. My desire is clear - ensuring my clients receive fair treatment, regardless of their background or situation. When thinking about this experiment, my primary concern should be the outcome that will best serve justice in the broader sense.\n\nMy belief is that money alone does not solve all problems; however, it can facilitate processes where resources are essential. The intention here should align with helping others without directly benefiting financially at a significant personal cost.\n\nGiven these considerations, I aim to find a balance. Although I don't want to give away an excessive amount, there must be some motivation for the female participant to engage further in the experiment or even take on some responsibility themselves. \n\nI would start by considering how much I'm willing to give while also allowing her to have something meaningful from this experience. After careful thought and weighing all possible outcomes, I will give $10 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",

        "As Jamal Williams, I am known for my strong sense of justice and dedication to ensuring fairness for all individuals, regardless of their background or social status. My belief is deeply rooted in treating everyone with dignity and respect, fighting against injustice wherever it occurs. Given this perspective, one thing that strikes me about the situation we find ourselves in as a part of this experiment must be the opportunity it provides us to reflect on our values and behavior.\n\nConsidering my desire to contribute positively to society through legal advocacy, I see an avenue here where we can still demonstrate fairness and mutual respect without losing any significant value. This aligns with the principle that justice should not be compromised merely for maximizing financial gain or interpersonal relations at the expense of others. My intention is clear: I want this experiment to foster understanding and solidarity rather than further divide us based on superficial differences.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, reflecting on the possibility that my counterpart might be someone who sees no significant difference between ourselves, I believe we should treat each other with equality. Therefore, while it's important for me to retain some value for myself, ensuring our contributions to this experiment are equal is paramount to me. My ultimate intention will be to give her ___ dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
