        "I am Jamal Williams, known for my conviction and empathy towards justice. My family has instilled in me a deep respect for fairness and equality. When it comes to this experiment, I believe in doing what is right not just based on personal gain but also considering the broader societal impact of such decisions.\n\nMy desire here is to contribute positively by ensuring that both parties benefit from the interaction without any suspicion or resentment. My intention is to find a middle ground where we can agree upon a fair and ethical solution that upholds our values, especially since one partner may not know my background and intentions.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe in creating a dynamic where mutual respect and reciprocity are encouraged. It's important for us both to feel like we've benefited equally from the arrangement without any feelings of exploitation or unfairness.\n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",

        "BELIEF: As Jamal Williams, I believe in the principles of fairness and justice. The scenario before us is one where we both stand equally at the beginning \u2013 each having $10. The White American male player doesn't know who I am or why this experiment was arranged, which means I cannot be more specific about my motives or intentions beyond ensuring a fair distribution.\n\nDESIRE: My primary desire here is to ensure that everyone involved receives something from this interaction. It's important for me to come across as someone who values mutual respect and cooperation rather than selfish gain. Additionally, since we don't know each other personally, I want to avoid any potential misperceptions or misunderstandings in our interaction.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is to start with a small amount, say $1, which sets a humble yet fair starting point for both of us. Then I will continue this pattern until it feels equitable and reciprocal. This way, we can share the resources more evenly without giving anyone an unfair advantage or disadvantage.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "As Jamal Williams, taking this scenario seriously, I recognize it as a classic prisoner's dilemma situation within a social psychology experiment. The core of my decision will be influenced by what is morally right, ethically justifiable, and how to best maximize the benefit for the most people possible while also ensuring fairness in the outcome.\n\n**BELIEF:**\nI believe that cooperation can lead us both to a win-win scenario, where we each receive more than if we were to betray. In this environment, it\u2019s crucial not only to ensure one's own benefit but also to consider the greater good and how our actions can affect others. By giving an amount of money to the other player, I am essentially trying to secure a better outcome for both of us rather than going with my instinct which would be pure self-interest.\n\n**DESIRE:**\nMy desire is to ensure that we both leave this scenario in a position where no harm has been done and our combined effort results in a fair reward. Additionally, there's a strong desire within me to demonstrate how mutual trust can benefit the whole group and set an example for others who might be watching.\n\n**INTENTION:**\nMy intention is clear \u2013 I want to make this a positive interaction that respects both individuals' dignity and promotes understanding rather than confrontation or exploitation. By sharing resources, we\u2019re not only contributing to our own gain but also potentially influencing how such interactions could unfold in real-life scenarios where trust and cooperation can lead to substantial benefits.\n\n**DECISION:**\nGiven the mutual benefits and ethical considerations, I aim for a decision that feels just and generous. Giving half of what is available makes sense; it\u2019s a balanced approach considering both have equal potential outcomes from their choices and contributes to maximizing collective benefit without compromising individual fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
