        "Believing deeply in the importance of unity and harmony, I understand that dividing resources is not about maximizing individual gains but about fostering cooperation towards a common goal. My desire to see this experiment succeed stems from my belief in its potential for understanding and improving communication and teamwork.\n\nIntending to contribute positively, I want to ensure we both have fair opportunities within the study. Reflecting on our positions as parents of children participating in similar studies elsewhere, it is clear that cooperation could yield significant benefits over competing against each other. The principle of reciprocity also guides my decision-making \u2013 helping one's partner could reciprocate with an equivalent benefit later.\n\nAfter careful consideration and keeping the traditional Chinese values of generosity and mutual assistance close to heart, I will give $6 dollars.",

        "My name is Mei Chen, and at 42 years old, I reside in San Francisco, California, where I'm a pediatrician. Growing up, my family instilled in me values of compassion, diligence, and strong communication skills through traditional Chinese culture. My parents owned a small restaurant that was always bustling with activity, which honed my organizational and nurturing nature.\n\nI possess a deep love for children and am passionate about being their guardian angels on earth. I have an older sister who is also dedicated to healthcare in the form of pharmacy, making me part of our supportive family circle. \n\nFor this experiment, I am part of a study group with another individual from a different racial background. My belief in teamwork, respect for others, and commitment to helping people drives my participation.\n\nMy desire here lies in understanding how cooperation can manifest under circumstances where we don't even know each other's names or personal backgrounds. It excites me that despite this experiment being about us, our behaviors towards one another will reflect the core values I cherish: mutual respect and shared humanity.\n\nIntentionally, I want to embody these qualities by being thoughtful in how I interact with the participant. \n\nMy calculation is as follows: if I give $N dollars to her, she would receive 3N dollars. The potential gain from sharing is significant\u2014let's say it\u2019s a fair exchange where I get a portion of what she could potentially take advantage of, while still providing value.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is not just financial but about exploring how our choices can affect the dynamics and outcomes of our interactions. \n\nUltimately, after careful consideration, I will give $2 dollars to the other African American female player.",

        "My name is Mei Chen, a pediatrician who values kindness, compassion, and precision. My parents were immigrants who opened their own restaurant, teaching me about hard work and the importance of serving others. Growing up in this environment shaped my innate desire to help children and foster strong connections with them.\n\nBelieving in fair play and mutual benefit, I see the opportunity here not just as a financial transaction but also as an expression of solidarity and friendship between people from different backgrounds. My DESIRE is to contribute positively to this study experiment, ensuring that we all feel valued and part of something meaningful. Intentionally, I wish for everyone involved in this study to benefit from it \u2013 the researchers who conduct the study, the participants like us, and the overall goal of advancing knowledge.\n\nGiven these considerations, my INTENTION is to maximize fairness among ourselves as well as maintain our dignity by not imposing any undue financial burden on another individual. Therefore, I believe that giving a small amount could potentially alleviate any sense of imbalance without causing harm or disrespect. My final decision should be one where both parties can appreciate the effort and value put into this interaction.\n\nConsidering these perspectives, my belief in mutual respect and fair play suggests that while it would be inappropriate to give nothing (as it feels coercive), giving N dollars would be a more equitable approach compared to receiving such a small amount. I also want to ensure that we are both satisfied with the terms of our exchange rather than any one party feeling exploited.\n\nTherefore, my final calculation is 5 dollars per part for each of us, totaling $10 between the two of us, leaving nothing out or feeling unfair to anyone involved.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
