        "My name is Mei Chen, and I am a pediatrician based in San Francisco. My role today involves making a decision that could either lead to personal satisfaction or compromise my principles. With $10 at stake from the study group, I find myself in an unfamiliar situation paired with another individual whose identity I do not know. \n\nBelieving in fair play and mutual respect, I recognize the importance of equality and harmony in all relationships, including those formed during such experiments. My desire is to ensure that both parties leave this experience feeling valued and respected, rather than having one party take more advantage of the situation.\n\nIntentionally aligning myself with these values, I aim for a solution where everyone benefits equally without any exploitation or inequality. Given our shared humanity and the potential connection we could form through mutual understanding and care in such circumstances, my belief is that we should treat each other justly.\n\nConsidering all factors, I find it reasonable to distribute the money in an equitable manner. Thus, taking into account the dynamics of the situation and ensuring mutual satisfaction:\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars to the other African American male player.",

        "I am Mei Chen, a pediatrician with deep compassion for children and their families. My family's values of hard work and dedication towards our community mean that I believe in working together to achieve something positive, even if it may seem challenging at first glance.\n\nMy desire is to ensure both parties receive the maximum benefit from this arrangement, as I am someone who cares deeply about fairness and equality. However, my understanding also includes the need for mutual respect and trust within any transaction or partnership. If given the option of giving $10 to another person in exchange for receiving 30 dollars in return, it would be important that both parties feel they are benefiting from such a deal.\n\nIn this scenario, I believe the fairest outcome is to give the African American male player half of what he would receive, ensuring each party feels equally compensated. This way, we can establish mutual respect and understanding.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
