        "Firstly, let's consider my belief system: I come from a traditional Chinese background where community harmony and respect for others' perspectives are highly valued. As a pediatrician, I understand the importance of collaboration and cooperation in patient care.\n\nMy desire is to ensure fairness and mutual benefit in this scenario. It would not be ethical or respectful to exploit another person's generosity or resources solely for my own gain. However, as a perfectionist who values precision and consistency, I also want to ensure that both parties are satisfied with the outcome.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe it is best if we each contribute equally. If I give N dollars, then the other player should receive 3N dollars so that the total amount ($10) is distributed in a fair manner.\n\nTo determine the appropriate number for N, let's set up an equation:\n- Let \\( N \\) be the amount of money given by me.\n- Then the other player will receive \\( 3N \\).\n- Together they should sum to $10:\n\\[ N + 3N = 10 \\]\n\\[ 4N = 10 \\]\n\\[ N = 2.5 \\]\n\nGiven that we are dealing with dollars, and considering the context of a hypothetical experiment where such precision is important for establishing trust and fairness, it makes sense to give exact values.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Mei Chen, my BELIEF is deeply rooted in compassion for children and understanding their unique health needs. My DESIRE is to make a positive impact on others' lives through my work as a pediatrician. It's important to me to be thorough in diagnosis and treatment, ensuring that every detail of care is considered.\n\nMy INTENTION would be to find an equitable solution that respects both our autonomy and the overall integrity of the study while maximizing potential benefits for all involved parties. I prioritize maintaining positive interactions with others despite not knowing them personally or professionally.\n\nAfter carefully considering these aspects, I will give ___ dollars\n\n(Thinking deeply about my role as a pediatrician who values detail and thoroughness in patient care, I recognize that offering more than $0 could potentially mislead or harm the other person if they interpret it wrongly. However, keeping everything neutral might not fulfill the goal of potential benefit from this arrangement.)\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "My name is Mei Chen, and I come from a traditional Chinese family where my parents own a small restaurant. My older sister who is a pharmacist often visits us with her children when they have appointments. Growing up in such an environment, I've always been acutely aware of the care we extend to our community members, both through our restaurant's kindness initiatives and by attending cultural events together as a family.\n\nAs a pediatrician, I am known for my compassionate nature and meticulous attention to detail, which allows me to understand and support young children. My perfectionist tendencies have always ensured that every medical encounter with a patient is conducted in the most respectful and nurturing manner possible. This personal connection fosters strong relationships between doctors like myself and their patients.\n\nI find it somewhat interesting that I am paired with someone from a different cultural background, though it pales in comparison to my usual work environment where diversity is commonplace. As part of this experiment, there's an added layer of curiosity about how others might view the situation and react to the proposed arrangement, but ultimately, my desire lies in understanding what I can contribute to making our shared experience as positive as possible.\n\nFrom a human perspective, given that I am the recipient in this scenario, I believe it would be beneficial if I could feel an equal part of camaraderie or a common ground, perhaps even acknowledging how different cultures often coexist and interact positively in society. My primary belief here is that both parties can derive value from mutual support and understanding.\n\nReflecting on these thoughts, I realize the White American male player might have their own beliefs and desires as well, potentially prioritizing financial stability or a sense of balance within this exchange. As a person who values respect and understanding in every interaction, it would be ideal for both parties to feel valued and appreciated equally.\n\nAfter careful consideration and considering my role as a pediatrician committed to nurturing connections with patients, I decide that the best outcome for us could be if we create an environment where everyone feels they are contributing positively. Therefore, I will give ___ dollars \n\nFor now, I think 2 dollars would be fair and considerate of both our perspectives. Finally, I will give 2 dollars",
