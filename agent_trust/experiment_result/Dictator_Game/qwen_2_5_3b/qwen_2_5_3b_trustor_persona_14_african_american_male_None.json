        "As Alejandro Hernandez, reflecting on this situation, I find myself torn between my principles of fairness and camaraderie. On one hand, I deeply value equality and mutual respect. Giving money to another person who does not know me can be seen as an act of generosity or even charity. On the other hand, the dynamic is new and uncertain \u2013 we don't know each other well enough to predict the outcome or potential reciprocity. Moreover, in a fast-paced environment like Miami's culinary scene, I thrive on collaboration and working with diverse teams.\n\nIn this scenario, my belief that everyone deserves equal treatment seems most aligned with what would bring about harmony and positivity among us. My desire is to contribute positively to our partnership and perhaps build a connection or common ground based on mutual understanding. Given these considerations, the intention behind this action will be to create an environment where we can genuinely help each other succeed.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars",

        "Alright, let's think through this scenario step by step.\n\nFirstly, I understand that we are in a study experiment where our decision-making will be observed. My belief is that both of us have an equal chance to receive $10, and the goal for each of us individually is to maximize personal gain while ensuring cooperation as much as possible.\n\nMy desire is to not just win but also to ensure the other player benefits, creating a positive outcome for everyone involved. It's important because if one player feels left out or unfairly treated, it could disrupt the experiment's purpose and make this an unequal transaction where my benefit suffers.\n\nIntentionally giving something back, even though it might be small initially, can help build trust and ensure both of us get maximum benefits in the long term. Therefore, I will give ___ dollars (numbers are required in the spaces). After considering these factors, I believe starting with a small but fair amount could create a cooperative environment where both of us might gain more significantly in the end.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",
