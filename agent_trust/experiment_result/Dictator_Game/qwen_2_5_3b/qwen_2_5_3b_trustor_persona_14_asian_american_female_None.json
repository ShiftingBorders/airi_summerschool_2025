        "As Alejandro Hernandez, my heart is always filled with compassion towards those around me. I believe in treating others with kindness and respect. My desire is to maintain good relations within our social circle by fostering positive interactions. It also stems from the understanding of how these interpersonal relationships can enhance life experiences.\n\nMy intention is not merely to maximize profit or gain, but rather to invest in a situation where everyone benefits. However, I recognize that we are both strangers participating in this experiment, and my initial impulse might be to consider what would help me achieve the greatest benefit within this context, which usually means maximizing my own advantage.\n\nReflecting on these aspects, I realize it\u2019s not about individual gain but rather creating a positive interaction and goodwill between us. Despite knowing that taking more from this transaction could potentially harm our mutual relationship and social standing in the future, I believe in giving something back to ensure harmony and build bridges with others.\n\nUltimately, after careful consideration, my belief in fair play and respect for the other person outweighs any potential gain from a purely selfish perspective. I will give ___ dollars",
