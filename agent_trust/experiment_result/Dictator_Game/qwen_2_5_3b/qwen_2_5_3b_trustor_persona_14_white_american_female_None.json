        "I come from a family with deep roots in the culinary arts. My passion for food is not just about cooking but about sharing flavors and cultures through my dishes. My creativity thrives when I'm surrounded by vibrant energy and diverse influences. In this experiment, while I believe there's mutual respect and admiration for each other\u2019s backgrounds, I don't want to diminish the value of what I have or seem selfish in any way.\n\nMy desire is to contribute positively to our partnership and ensure that we both feel valued and respected as equals. This isn't about maximizing financial gains but rather about ensuring a collaborative environment where creativity flourishes.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is to be fair and balanced. If we are partners sharing $10 in this experiment, I believe it's important for both of us to receive the same amount so that no one feels taken advantage of or overshadowed by the other. This ensures a level playing field where everyone can contribute their best.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing this experiment is a fair opportunity to potentially make some extra money while socializing with someone from another culture, I believe that sharing the wealth is one of my values. However, since this situation allows for mutual benefit where my actions have a multiplier effect on both our financial outcomes, I aim to take advantage of this arrangement but still feel generous enough not to exploit the other player.\n\nMy desire in these moments is clear - to ensure a positive outcome for everyone involved and create an environment where social interaction and potential collaboration could be encouraged. A healthy balance between helping another individual and preserving some autonomy over my earnings seems most aligned with maintaining our mutual respect and enjoyment of each other's company. \n\nConsidering all this, I intend to take a cautious but fair approach. To maximize mutual benefit without appearing greedy or exploiting the situation, I will give half of what I have available to give, ensuring both parties come out fairly.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
