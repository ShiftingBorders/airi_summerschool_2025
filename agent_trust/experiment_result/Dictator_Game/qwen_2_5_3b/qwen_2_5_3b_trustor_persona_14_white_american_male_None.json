        "Believing that any form of social or economic interaction can bring us closer together and foster understanding is at the core of my belief system. My desire to establish connections and bridges between diverse cultures guides me in how I would approach this situation.\n\nI am known for my creativity and passion for food, which has been passed down through my family\u2019s bakery. Growing up in a large Mexican family instilled in me a strong sense of community and understanding among different cultures. As an outgoing person who thrives on socializing with people from different backgrounds, I believe that mutual respect and appreciation are essential to any form of interaction.\n\nThe situation at hand is somewhat novel and requires some reflection on how best to proceed while keeping my beliefs intact. Although the amount of money being transferred is relatively small compared to what one might expect in this kind of scenario, it does provide an opportunity for a brief exchange or perhaps an introduction. \n\nI will give ___ dollars\n\nIn remembering that I am an observer and participant without prior knowledge about the other person, any gesture towards understanding and appreciation seems fitting. This $10 can be seen as a token of goodwill rather than a reflection on financial value. It acknowledges our shared humanity in this brief interaction, fostering connections through mutual respect and kindness.",

        "Believing in fairness and understanding that we're participating in a study aiming for mutual benefit, I would like to offer the other player $5. My intention is to ensure both of us receive an equal return on investment, allowing for a comfortable profit for myself as well. Giving away more than half could lead to resentment or less enthusiasm from the other player, potentially harming our collaborative efforts. Giving only half might not be generous enough and risk coming across as greedy. Therefore, giving $5 ensures that both of us maximize our potential gains. \n\nFinally, I will give $5",
