        "My name is Aisha Khan, and I am a 31-year-old journalist currently based in London. My family background includes my parents who are doctors and an older brother who is an engineer. I come from Pakistan with Middle Eastern descent, embodying the intersection of these diverse influences deeply embedded within me.\n\nI have always been drawn to stories that challenge norms and seek truth, which is why journalism has played a significant role in both my personal journey and professional career as a journalist. My family's values instilled in me a sense of curiosity about the world around us and a firm belief in using storytelling to effect positive change for marginalized communities.\n\nGiven these characteristics, I am aware that I am in an experiment designed to study interactions between individuals of different races and backgrounds. This situation is entirely new and unfamiliar territory, and there are no instructions or clear guidelines on how one should behave.\n\nMy intention in this situation stems from my belief in empathy and the importance of understanding others through their experiences. My desire is to engage in a way that could potentially build bridges rather than walls between us. However, I am also aware that any decision I make could have implications for both myself and the other participant in the study.\n\nConsidering all these factors, what resonates most with me is my deep empathy towards those who are part of marginalized communities. I understand the importance of inclusive narratives and voices being heard. This sense of responsibility towards others drives my understanding and approach to this experiment.\n\nI will give ___ dollars\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "Believing firmly in the power of storytelling and journalism to bring about positive change, I know it's crucial to treat others with empathy and fairness, regardless of their background or identity. My deep-rooted belief in justice drives me to ensure this interaction does not reinforce harmful stereotypes or biases. I want every voice to be heard equally. In this scenario, my desire is to ensure that the other player receives a fair share of the $10, understanding that everyone deserves an opportunity to contribute to the discussion.\n\nMy intention is clear: To give half of the money ($5) to the other African American male player. I believe this balances both parties' contribution and reflects mutual respect in our interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I am Aisha Khan, a 31-year-old journalist based in London. My background is rooted in curiosity about diverse cultures and storytelling; I find great satisfaction in sharing stories of marginalized communities through my work, and I believe journalism has the power to bring about positive change. As someone deeply committed to uncovering truths and empathizing with those who are often overlooked, I am driven by a strong belief that these insights can lead to meaningful impact.\n\nIn this experiment, our goal is not just for personal gain but to understand the dynamics of human behavior and empathy within marginalized communities. The scenario presented involves a decision-making process where financial incentives could reveal much about people's willingness to support one another in times of need.\n\nMy desire in this situation stems from my strong belief that we all deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of race or background. It would be crucial for me to uphold this value by ensuring fairness and equality even if the decision impacts an individual I don't know personally. \n\nIntentionally, I want to give a voice to the principles of compassion and unity within marginalized communities. My intention here is not merely to maximize my own financial benefit but to promote understanding and support among African American individuals, fostering environments where we can build bridges instead of barriers.\n\nTaking into consideration these elements\u2014my belief in empathy and its power to bridge divides, my desire for fairness, and my intention to uplift the voices of marginalized communities\u2014I decide to contribute half of what I receive. This aligns with my understanding that when resources are shared equitably, it creates a more inclusive and supportive society.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
