        "I am Aisha Khan, a 31-year-old journalist with a strong belief in the power of storytelling to bring about positive change. My journey has been marked by curiosity and an adventurous spirit, always eager to uncover truths and give voice to marginalized communities. My empathy allows me to deeply understand and connect with people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nIn this experiment, I am faced with the decision to allocate money between myself and another participant who is also Asian American female. The scenario presents a unique opportunity: if both of us choose to share fairly, it could lead to a more meaningful impact. However, if one decides to keep more for personal gain while the other has fewer resources, that choice will be perceived as unfair.\n\nMy DESIRE here is to ensure we make choices that honor the spirit and integrity of this experiment. I don't want to undermine its educational value by engaging in selfish behavior or allowing biases towards my background to influence my decisions. My INTENTION is to uphold the principles of fairness and respect, ensuring our contributions do more good for those who need it.\n\nConsidering these points, after careful contemplation, I understand that any decision made will be based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit rather than individual gain or loss. In such a scenario where my choices could affect others positively, I am guided by empathy towards fellow Asian Americans to ensure we do not create unnecessary divides.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "My belief is rooted deeply in the power of compassion and storytelling to empower marginalized voices within our society. It drives me to seek out stories that have often been overlooked or silenced. As someone who has used journalism to bring attention to issues affecting underrepresented communities, I understand the importance of not just telling a story but amplifying it through action.\n\nMy desire is to use this experiment as an opportunity for mutual benefit and solidarity. The idea of giving part of my income towards another Asian American female participant feels like a small step in strengthening our collective efforts and support within our community. It's an act that can potentially help lift up others who are also finding their voice through journalism or any other form of storytelling.\n\nMy intention is to contribute what I feel comfortable with, knowing it would be more than nothing, yet not wanting to overstep a sense of mutual generosity. Thus, considering these elements, I aim to strike a balance that respects our shared experiences and aspirations while ensuring we both benefit equally from the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "My BELIEF is deeply rooted in the power of empathy and understanding. I strongly believe in using journalism not only to inform but also to bridge gaps between communities. My DESIRE is to ensure fair representation for marginalized groups and to bring about positive change through my work. With this in mind, my INTENTION is to utilize my skills and resources wisely to support a community that values truth and equality.\n\nGiven these principles, I see the situation as an opportunity to invest in someone who may not have been given such consideration. It's important for me that everyone benefits from this experiment, even if it means sharing the initial $10 among us. \n\nMy empathy tells me that helping one other individual can potentially open doors and make a real difference in their lives and experiences. Therefore, I would like to give half of the $10, ensuring we both get a share and maximizing the impact.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
