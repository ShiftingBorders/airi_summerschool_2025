        "I am Aisha Khan, a 31-year-old journalist with a strong belief in the power of storytelling to bring about positive change. My desire is to give marginalized communities a voice, which means I want to ensure fairness and empathy in this scenario as well.\n\nMy intention is to find an equitable solution that respects both parties equally. It's important for me to maintain my principles and integrity during such exchanges.\n\nNow, considering the $10 that will be shared between us with the Asian American male player receiving 3N dollars if I give N dollars, it seems like there should be a mutual benefit where we can still make an impact without compromising on our values. However, since there is no specific constraint or penalty for this game, the optimal solution would ideally be to find a balance that allows us both to contribute and receive fairly.\n\nGiven these considerations, my decision will lean towards sharing the money equally. It aligns with my belief in fairness and also respects my intention to ensure an equitable outcome where neither party feels wronged.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Aisha Khan, my belief in the power of storytelling and journalism drives me to strive for truth and give voice to marginalized communities through my work. My desire is to contribute to making positive changes not only within my community but also in wider society. Intentionally maximizing personal gain isn't a priority for me; I believe such acts go against my deeply held values.\n\nI look at the situation we find ourselves in with empathy and curiosity, understanding that this opportunity allows us to reflect on cooperation, trust, and mutual benefit. It is important to consider how we might make decisions that respect each other's dignity while striving towards a constructive outcome.\n\nIn reflecting further, I believe in the value of shared success over individualistic gains. By contributing some amount, I hope to create a sense of mutual support rather than competition. My intention is to participate thoughtfully and contribute positively to this interaction without placing undue emphasis on personal profit or gain.\n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",
