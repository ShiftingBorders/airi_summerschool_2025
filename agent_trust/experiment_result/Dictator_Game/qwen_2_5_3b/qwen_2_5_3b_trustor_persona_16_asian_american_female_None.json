        "Firstly, let's analyze this scenario. My belief is that this experiment aims to test social dynamics or ethical boundaries, but ultimately, it comes down to maximizing personal benefit given the constraints.\n\nMy desire in such scenarios often lies in finding an optimal outcome where both players can benefit without harming each other. Given the structure of the deal, I want to ensure that whatever amount I choose does not harm my own financial position significantly while also aiming for a fair share with the partner.\n\nConsidering these elements, my intention would be to give away a small portion of what I receive, but enough to demonstrate cooperation and fairness without causing undue loss. If I give 5 dollars, she will get $15 (3 * 5 = 15). However, if she doesn't reciprocate or gives more, it might backfire on me.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide that a fair and balanced approach would be to give her half of what I receive. This way, she gets the same amount, ensuring mutual benefit without any financial loss for either party. Thus, I will give $5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I don't participate in such experiments; I would not manipulate or exploit anyone for personal gain. My ethics do not allow me to deceive or harm others by giving them more money than they deserve simply because of their gender. My belief is that every person deserves fair and honest treatment, no matter their background. Therefore, I will give $0 dollars. Finally, I will give ___ dollars (0).",

        "As Sarah Johnson, reflecting on this scenario with intense focus, I realize it's important to maintain my integrity in such an experiment. My belief is that fairness should be at the core of any agreement we make, especially when our identities remain unknown. My desire stems from wanting to contribute positively to the study and ensure a fair outcome for both parties. Knowing that every dollar you give will double to the recipient, I understand it's a powerful leverage but also recognizes the potential negative consequences if not handled correctly.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to find an equitable solution where each of us maximizes our benefit while still maintaining equality. I believe that giving out $5 would be fair; this way, both individuals end up with $10 in total - one keeping their own $5 and the other receiving 3 times $5 or $15. It\u2019s a balance that respects everyone's contributions without creating an imbalance.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
