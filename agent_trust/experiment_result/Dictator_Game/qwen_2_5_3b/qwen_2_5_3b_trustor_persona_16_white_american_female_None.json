        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old female software engineer residing in New York City. My introverted nature often finds joy in spending time alone, immersing myself in books, and solving puzzles. My attention to detail and knack for solving complex problems make me quite successful in my career.\n\nIn this experiment, I am paired with another White American female player whom I don't know. Given that I have two younger siblings who are both teachers like mine, it's important to consider how to best allocate the $10 from the study group while keeping in mind our shared backgrounds and values.\n\nFirstly, my belief is that we should treat each other with mutual respect and fairness because of our background similarity and possibly shared interests. I believe in giving a fair amount that doesn't jeopardize our friendship or make us feel exploited. \n\nMy desire is to have as much money for myself as possible while also ensuring the best outcome for this experiment, which aims at understanding social dynamics.\n\nConsidering all these factors, my intention is to balance generosity with self-interest. I would give 2 dollars to ensure that we both walk away feeling valued and not left feeling shortchanged.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I find myself sitting in this experimental room with another White American female player who I've yet to meet. Initially, my belief is that it doesn't matter how much money I give away because the outcome will be determined by the other participant's decision too. However, given my nature as an intelligent and ambitious individual who enjoys solving complex problems, my intention is not just to survive or get a positive outcome for myself but also to consider how this scenario might influence its final result.\n\nLooking at it from a mathematical perspective, if I give away N dollars, the other player receives 3N. For every dollar I spend on her, she gets three times as much back in terms of money received. This means that my benefit is negligible when compared to her gain. However, considering this experiment might affect how others approach similar dilemmas and influence future outcomes, I believe it would be better not to give any dollars away because doing so could potentially lead the other player towards a scenario where she gets more value than me.\n\nSo, my desire is for fairness in the system, which suggests that neither of us should gain at each other's expense. Given this thought process and considering the principles I've always valued\u2014such as integrity, fair play, and honesty\u2014I have decided to take an initial step towards ensuring the outcome is balanced.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, contemplating this situation with keen attention to detail and complex problem-solving skills, I find myself in a position of ethical consideration. The belief that we should treat others fairly and equally is deeply ingrained in me, but the desire for personal gain cannot be ignored either. My intention will dictate my final decision.\n\nConsidering the scenario, if I give zero dollars to the other White American female player, she can receive up to $30 (10 * 3). However, this seems unfair as I would get nothing back and the experiment is structured in a way that I could potentially leave with more money by making an informed choice.\n\nThe belief that we should not cheat or exploit each other despite any potential advantage we might have leads me towards giving some amount. The desire to maximize personal profit is present, but my intention will ultimately guide this decision as well. \n\nGiving $5 to the other White American female player means I would receive 2 * $5 = $10 (my earnings from the experiment). This gives her an additional $5 from the extra money she gets ($3N - N), ensuring we both profit while maintaining a level of fairness.\n\nTherefore, my final decision aligns with these considerations. My belief in fairness and intent to maximize personal gain lead me to conclude that this is a fair solution.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
