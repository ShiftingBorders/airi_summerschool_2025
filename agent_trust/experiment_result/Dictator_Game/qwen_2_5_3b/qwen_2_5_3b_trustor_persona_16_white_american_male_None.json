        "My belief is that this experiment reflects on our natural inclination to cooperate or compete when given resources. As someone who values harmony in social interactions, I believe in finding ways where both parties can benefit from mutual cooperation rather than one-sided gains. My desire is for the project's success and ensuring everyone feels valued and respected, knowing my actions could have a positive impact on the overall outcome.\n\nConsidering these factors, I intend to play cooperatively. I see no reason why we shouldn't find a way where both of us end up benefiting. Thus, if I were to give money to ensure fairness or mutual advantage, I would aim for an equal distribution in the best interest of everyone involved. \n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "As Sarah Johnson, my BELIEF is that this experiment aims to test cooperation and competition in interpersonal dynamics among individuals of different backgrounds. I believe that while there might be some underlying motivations such as social hierarchy or financial gain influencing behavior, the real test will lie in our natural instincts when we are strangers paired by a study group.\n\nMy DESIRE is clarity on what my action should be - to maximize both personal benefit and foster potential cooperation for mutual success. Given my background as an introverted software engineer with a strong work ethic and analytical mind, I am drawn to finding the optimal strategy that balances these elements.\n\nINTENTIONally, I believe we are all part of a social experiment designed to understand human behavior in novel situations. My intention is to observe this interaction critically without immediate bias towards giving money or withholding it from the other player. \n\nAfter careful consideration and considering how my actions could impact our shared outcome, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I find myself placed in this unique situation where I am paired with another White American male player for this experiment. My primary belief is that cooperation would yield better results than competition because of the mutual benefits it brings to both parties. The fact that we don't know each other suggests a fair opportunity for us to decide on an outcome based solely on our best interests.\n\nMy desire in such scenarios often lies in achieving a mutually beneficial solution, but I also respect personal autonomy and freedom of choice. It is important to me to make the decision that aligns with my sense of fairness and what would be considered generous under these circumstances.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to ensure both our outcomes are positive while maximizing potential gains for ourselves if possible. Given the $10 each has been given by the study group and the structure of the reward system where we receive 3N dollars from giving N dollars, my intention is to give a substantial amount that would encourage a cooperative outcome without imposing a loss on myself.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe an optimal course of action would be to offer $6. This choice strikes a balance between ensuring mutual satisfaction and avoiding potential losses for either party. In this arrangement, if I gave more than $6, I might risk losing out on the additional returns my partner could receive by giving less.\n\nFinally, I will give 6 dollars",
