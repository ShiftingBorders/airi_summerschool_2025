        "Firstly, let's examine my position from the perspective of my role: Jamal Patel, a compassionate and dedicated doctor in London.\n\nMy BELIEF is that fairness and empathy should be paramount in all interactions, especially within this experiment. The idea that we might end up giving different amounts to ensure balance seems misguided and exploitative rather than generous or caring. This principle guides me towards providing as much of the $10 I receive as possible without jeopardizing my own benefit.\n\nMy DESIRE is for a fair outcome. Ideally, both of us would receive more money if we could divide it equally. However, I also need to ensure that neither party ends up worse off than them in terms of their relative contribution compared to what they can expect from the other player.\n\nConsidering these points, my INTENTION is clear: I want to give at least enough to not unduly disadvantage myself but also want to contribute fairly to this interaction. The balance here will be a delicate one. If I give nothing, it feels wrong as an experiment like this doesn't inherently privilege selfishness; if I give more than I strictly need to compensate, it risks becoming exploitative.\n\nAfter weighing these considerations, my calculated course of action is clear: I want to maximize the fairness and compassion within our interaction while also ensuring that neither party receives too little. Therefore, I will give the other African American female player 4 dollars out of the $10 she received from the study group. This amount leaves me with $6, which I think aligns well with maintaining a fair balance and avoiding exploitation.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars 4",
