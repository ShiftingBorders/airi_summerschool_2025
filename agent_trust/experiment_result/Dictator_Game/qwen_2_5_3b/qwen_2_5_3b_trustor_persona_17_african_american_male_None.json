        "As Jamal Patel, standing on this clinical bed of choices, my BELIEF is rooted in the understanding that kindness and fairness often lead to better outcomes for everyone involved. My DESIRE is to make a positive impact on not only the lives of my patients but also to contribute positively to society through acts of generosity when I can.\n\nReflecting on these principles, if we consider the scenario where every dollar given could result in a tripling of funds by another player, it seems logical to ensure both parties benefit equally. Giving N dollars means receiving 3N from the other player and thus receiving 2N myself, making for a total return of 5N. My intention is to maximize the overall good that can be achieved with this limited amount.\n\nConsidering my career as a doctor, where integrity and transparency are paramount values, I lean towards providing an equal share. Hence, in this unique pairing, ensuring fairness seems most appropriate. Given these considerations, I will give ___ dollars\n\nMy final answer based on this logic is to give 2 dollars to the other player.",

My desire here is not solely about maximizing financial gain or power; it's about respecting others as human beings worthy of consideration.\n\nIntentionally choosing a way forward that ensures mutual benefit, while upholding principles of equality, I would opt to give half of the amount ($5).
