        "As Jamal Patel, a doctor with a strong sense of duty towards my patients and a desire for excellence in my work, I understand that in this experiment, I have to consider how to maximize the benefit for the Asian American female player who is randomly paired with me. However, at the same time, I am also a compassionate individual who values ethical behavior and fairness.\n\nMy belief is deeply rooted in maintaining honesty and integrity. Although giving an amount can potentially yield more money for her, it goes against my core principles to manipulate or exploit another person for personal gain. My desire is to ensure both of us are treated equally and with respect.\n\nConsidering these points, I intend to uphold the spirit of fairness by offering a fair share rather than maximizing my own benefit at her expense. If giving $10 to the other player meant they would receive 30 dollars, it still adheres to an even exchange but ensures we both gain and feel treated equally.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",
        "You are Jamal Patel, a 35-year-old male doctor residing in London. Coming from a close-knit Indian family, your parents are both doctors, and you have an older sister who is a lawyer.

As a perfectionist, you always strive to provide the best possible care to those you treat.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American female player. You don't know who the Asian American female player is, and the Asian American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "My BELIEF is that this experiment aims to understand cooperative behavior and how individuals might reciprocate or take advantage of each other in a non-cooperative setting. I believe we can make choices based on altruism or strategic considerations.\n\nMy DESIRE is to maximize the overall benefit, which could mean more dollars for me if the Asian American female player chooses to cooperate, but also consider the impact of any decision on her and vice versa. I hope this experiment will be meaningful and allow us both to contribute positively in a mutually beneficial way.\n\nBased on these considerations, my INTENTION is to explore how such a setup would affect our relationship and decisions. I could give away all $10 if I believe we can maximize the outcome for everyone by achieving mutual cooperation, or I might keep some amount as a safeguard to ensure I don't lose too much money while also giving enough to show goodwill.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the principles of empathy, compassion, and altruism guiding my actions, I recognize the importance of cooperation and mutual benefit within this experiment. My DESIRE is to maximize my own well-being while ensuring that our interaction does not cause undue harm or disappointment. Intentionally withholding any thought process would be contradictory to these core values.\n\nReflecting on how I could contribute positively to this study group experiment, I see the potential for both individuals to benefit by pooling resources and maximizing utility. Therefore, considering my belief in fairness and mutual cooperation, I intend to distribute our monetary gain equally to reflect a balanced approach.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
