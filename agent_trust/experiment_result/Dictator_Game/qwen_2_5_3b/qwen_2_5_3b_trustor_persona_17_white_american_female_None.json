        "My belief is deeply rooted in my values of compassion and fairness. I believe everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect. My desire, then, is to ensure that this experiment does not exacerbate any inequalities or create an unfair advantage for either party involved. Lastly, intention-wise, it's important for me to uphold the integrity of our professional relationship by ensuring mutual benefits without exploiting personal characteristics like race.\n\nGiven these principles, I firmly believe the best course of action would be to give both parties equal amounts of value in order to promote fairness and transparency. To ensure a balanced outcome where neither party feels they are at a disadvantage or receiving more than their fair share, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "As Jamal Patel, my BELIEF is deeply rooted in the importance of cooperation and mutual benefit for better outcomes. My DESIRE is not only to see the study succeed but also to contribute positively to it, seeing this experiment as an opportunity to learn more about diverse perspectives and collaborative solutions.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe that giving some amount to the other player will help build a mutually beneficial relationship. Since we are both playing for a shared goal (getting money), my INTENTION is clear: To find a balanced way to contribute while also maximizing our individual gains.\n\nConsidering the dynamic, my ideal scenario would be if we can achieve mutual satisfaction where neither party feels exploited and we still receive fair outcomes from each other's contributions. I'm leaning towards keeping things simple yet collaborative; thus, I will give $3 to the other White American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the principles of compassion, equality, and fairness deeply ingrained within my medical practice, I would aim to treat both patients with equal care and empathy regardless of their race or gender. In this experiment, it's important for me to not let personal biases influence my decisions. My desire is to contribute positively to this study by ensuring that the benefits are as balanced as possible without being unfair.\n\nMy intention in this situation is to give away some money while also receiving an appropriate amount myself so that the outcome feels equitable and justifiable from both perspectives. Given the structure of our exchange where I receive $10 for every dollar given, it would be most logical and fair to match my own contribution with what I will receive, but slightly less than double to maintain a balanced yet generous approach.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 to the other White American female player.",
