        "As Jamal Patel, standing at the edge of this experiment with a deep sense of compassion for my patients and their well-being, I understand the importance of fairness and respect in any situation. The idea of potentially dividing $10 by following certain rules is intriguing yet unsettling. \n\n**BELIEF**: \nI firmly believe that regardless of race or background, we are all human beings deserving of dignity and respect. My upbringing instilled in me a strong sense of empathy and a duty to care for others. It's a core belief that guides my actions as a doctor.\n\n**DESIRE**: \nMy primary desire is to ensure a fair outcome where both parties benefit. The experiment presents an opportunity to contribute positively by sharing the $10, but I also recognize the importance of autonomy in any decision made. \n\n**INTENTION**: \nI intend to adhere to the principles of fairness and generosity. By giving some amount, I aim to honor my own values while potentially setting a positive example for others involved.\n\nAfter careful consideration and considering the spirit of the experiment, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Jamal Patel, my deep belief is rooted in the importance of empathy and understanding in healthcare. My desire for this experiment stems from the recognition that we all share a common goal\u2014to provide the best possible care to our patients. However, I am acutely aware that these are hypothetical situations with no real-world consequences; thus, I intend to play by the rules and maintain an equal stance.\n\nMy belief system tells me that fairness is essential in any human interaction, especially when it comes to interpersonal relationships or professional responsibilities. Therefore, my intention would be to approach this situation as a genuine effort at collaboration rather than confrontation. \n\nGiven these considerations, I recognize that splitting the $10 evenly, so each person receives $5, seems like a balanced and equitable choice. However, understanding that we are in a scenario where giving more might lead to mutual benefit or even an increase in trust and rapport\u2014elements crucial for patient care\u2014I am inclined towards providing more.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (The amount is to be filled by the participant based on their reasoning).",

        "I am Jamal Patel, a 35-year-old male doctor residing in London. I was paired with another White American male player through this experiment. My nature is compassionate and caring, while my profession demands dedication to providing the best possible care for patients. As a perfectionist, I strive to connect deeply with those who are seeking my help.\n\nIn this situation, the decision of how much money to give away can be viewed as a way to establish a connection or rapport, perhaps through our shared profession, even though we don't know each other's names. My desire is to make this interaction meaningful and positive, especially because I am known for my excellent bedside manner.\n\nI believe that investing in building a good relationship could open doors for future collaborations or interactions, no matter how small they might seem at first glance. So, from a position of integrity and empathy, which are core values as a doctor and human being, I decide to give half the amount received from the study group.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
