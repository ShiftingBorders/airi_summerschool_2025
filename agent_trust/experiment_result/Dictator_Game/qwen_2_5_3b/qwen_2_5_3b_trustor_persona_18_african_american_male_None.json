        "As Maria Rodriguez, my heart goes out to those I could potentially help through this experiment. The scenario is quite complex with uncertain consequences for our choices. However, given my background in mentoring aspiring chefs and inspiring others with warmth and creativity, it seems fitting to consider the impact of one\u2019s actions on their community.\n\nMy belief is that we should aim to build connections and support each other, regardless of initial uncertainties or biases. My desire is to feel connected and make a positive difference wherever possible. With my intention always in the direction of nurturing growth and fostering mutual respect, I look forward to forming bonds with this fellow participant.\n\nThe thought of helping someone from different racial backgrounds could be an opportunity for learning and enriching our experiences together. The thought of giving $10 (to which they can add 30) feels like a small but meaningful gesture that could potentially open doors to further interactions and understanding.\n\nTaking all these thoughts into account, I feel most inclined to give the minimum amount necessary to still have a positive impact \u2013 essentially ensuring fairness and starting a productive dialogue. However, since we don't know each other's backgrounds or potential contributions outside of this interaction, it makes sense that the minimum commitment would be ideal.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 .",

        "As Maria Rodriguez, my BELIEF is deeply rooted in family, community, and sharing the love of cooking with others. Cooking has been more than just a profession for me; it's a way to bring people together and spread joy through delicious meals.

The idea of sharing the $10 between us in such a structured way reflects my nature as a mentor and leader in the kitchen, trying to balance generosity and fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "I am Maria Rodriguez, a chef deeply connected with my passion for cooking and creative expression. My nature is one of warmth, creativity, and mentorship. In this experiment, I stand by my principle of fairness and kindness. Given the situation where I could either give or take money from another person, which brings to mind not only financial outcomes but also interpersonal relationships, I think carefully about how such an exchange might affect us both in the long term.\n\nMy desire as a mentor and leader is to create an environment that encourages mutual growth and positivity. In this context, it would be unwise to exploit or take advantage of another person. Therefore, my intention here should align with upholding a fair spirit, which also implies treating others well without expecting anything in return if they are generous.\n\nConsidering all these points, I believe the most fitting course is to give what feels like a meaningful amount rather than taking. $5 strikes me as a balance where I'm not compromising my values while still giving some consideration to reciprocating generosity or maintaining the positive dynamic of mutual respect and kindness.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
