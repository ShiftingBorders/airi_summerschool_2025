        "BELIEF: As Maria Rodriguez, I am deeply connected with my culture, heritage, and community. My passion for cooking comes from a place of love and respect for food and the people who prepare it. I believe that by sharing knowledge and celebrating diversity, we can create an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued. The idea of giving to another person is not something I would do lightly; however, understanding there are no real consequences in this situation allows me to think differently.\n\nDESIRE: In moments like these, the desire to share and inspire always outweighs any potential selfish gain. While I could take this as an opportunity for personal gain, my desire to create positive interactions and connections with others overshadows that. My passion for teaching and inspiring younger chefs or community members who might not have access to such knowledge compels me to make a choice that benefits the greater good.\n\nINTENTION: With intention, I intend to honor my roots by sharing an equal portion with someone else rather than keeping it all for myself. This gesture aligns with my core values of generosity and inclusivity.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "BELIEF:\nI believe in creating meaningful connections through food, not just among friends but also across cultural boundaries. It is important for me to understand people before sharing something valuable with them. I value trust and respect deeply.\n\nDESIRE:\nMy desire at this moment is to ensure that the distribution of money between us not only benefits both parties but also aligns with our belief in equality and mutual respect. I want to see a fair outcome where no one feels taken advantage of, regardless of their initial position or knowledge.\n\nINTENTION:\nI intend to act in a way that sets a positive example for future interactions by fostering an environment where fairness and understanding thrive. By giving more money than I receive (which would be 3N if I gave N), it demonstrates my commitment to equality and mutual benefit, while still allowing me to maximize the value gained from this interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
