        "As Ahmed Khan, I come from a strong traditional family background where values like integrity and fair play are highly valued. My upbringing instilled in me principles of honesty and respect for others' rights, even when facing difficult situations.\n\nMy primary belief is the importance of maintaining trust and fairness in any interaction. In this scenario, I firmly believe that it's important to reciprocate with equal or greater benefit, ensuring both parties are satisfied while upholding ethical standards.\n\nMy desire in this situation is to ensure a win-win outcome for both myself and the African American female player. I would want her to feel just as confident about the deal as I do, if not more so, fostering camaraderie rather than suspicion or mistrust.\n\nI intend to act with utmost honesty and integrity. This includes respecting my partner's autonomy in making a decision, even though they may be unfamiliar with each other\u2019s values and circumstances.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would allocate 5 dollars from my share of $10, so that the female player gets 15 dollars while still benefiting me financially. This way, we both maximize our gains without straying into dishonest territory. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Given my position in this scenario and considering my personality traits such as confidence, assertiveness, and analytical thinking, I would approach this with a nuanced understanding of game theory, particularly focusing on how to allocate resources efficiently while maintaining potential future benefits.\n\nBelief: The African American female player is an unknown variable, so the decision should be grounded in maximizing possible outcomes for both parties. If I believe that there could be potential long-term strategic gains or alliances, it would be wise to consider a strategy that doesn't risk leaving too much at stake if the partnership proves beneficial.\n\nDesire: As someone who values fairness and wants to ensure equal returns for all involved while preserving options for future cooperation, my primary desire is to distribute resources in a balanced way. Additionally, I am looking for strategies that might lead to a long-term positive outcome rather than a quick win at the expense of the other player.\n\nIntention: My intention here would be to create a situation where both parties feel rewarded and motivated to maintain or expand this relationship. This involves giving away resources thoughtfully but in a way that ensures no one feels cheated or overly disadvantaged.\n\nTaking all these elements into account, I believe the optimal approach is for me to give half of what I have ($5) to the African American female player. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I am Ahmed Khan, a 45-year-old male lawyer from Dubai. My background, personality traits, and interests have prepared me for this situation, but I approach it with an open mind and a desire to ensure fairness in the outcomes. Being analytical and perfectionist, every decision made will be based on logic and consideration of potential impacts.\n\nFirstly, my belief is that sharing should not come at the cost of one person gaining excessively more than another. I am inclined towards giving a fair amount that does not disadvantage either party significantly but also maintains an equitable distribution.\n\nMy desire in this scenario revolves around ensuring both parties feel satisfied with their share and do not perceive it as unfair. By distributing resources efficiently, we can avoid any resentment or feelings of injustice.\n\nIntentionally, my intention is to give a sum where the African American female player's income is at least 150% of what I receive (which would be $30), ensuring that both individuals are not disadvantaged and maintaining an acceptable balance. \n\nConsidering all these elements, given my analytical nature and desire for fairness, I will give ___ dollars.\n\nAfter a careful thought process aligned with the principles of mutual satisfaction and equitable distribution, I will give 5 dollars.",
