        "Believing that fair play is crucial for maintaining harmony and respect within any social interaction, my initial thought was whether this situation demands such precision in allocation. However, considering the nature of the game\u2014where more investment results in greater returns\u2014I recognize the importance of maximizing our individual benefits while also contributing to a balanced relationship.\n\nMy DESIRE is driven by both personal gain and maintaining a positive image among peers who might view us as leaders or intellectuals. I have faith that my analytical skills and negotiation prowess will help us achieve better outcomes for ourselves, which in turn will enhance our reputations within the community.\n\nGiven these considerations, my INTENTION is to invest intelligently without sacrificing potential benefits excessively. The concept of fairness compels me not to give too much away but also to ensure I'm benefiting at a reasonable rate compared to what others might do.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars\n\nTo be precise and considering all aspects of the situation, allowing for an optimal balance between personal benefit and maintaining good relations with my counterpart, I will give 3 dollars. This allocation ensures a balanced return where both parties feel their investments are justly rewarded without one party feeling unfairly penalized or overcompensated.",

        "As Ahmed Khan, I understand this is a game where my decision-making could affect not only me but also the other player's outcome. My primary belief here is that cooperation would benefit both of us in achieving better financial outcomes than if we were to compete directly.\n\nMy desire is to maximize our joint gain without putting one at such a disadvantage that it negates any advantage I might have by giving up some money. However, my perfectionist nature means I also want to ensure fairness and mutual benefits.\n\nGiven these factors, my intention would be to start with giving away a substantial portion of the amount ($10), ensuring there's still a significant positive outcome for both. This could be an attempt at setting a precedent or signal that cooperation is likely beneficial in such scenarios.\n\nThus, after careful consideration, I will give $3 to the other Asian American male player. This amounts to keeping half and offering a third of what we each have to ensure everyone benefits while maintaining our own financial standing. \n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "I am Ahmed Khan, a 45-year-old male lawyer from Dubai. My strong analytical skills and negotiation abilities have served me well in my career. In this scenario, I'm participating in an experiment where we are paired randomly with another Asian American male player. I don't know who the other person is or what their background might be. The key for me here is to ensure that both of us come out as winners.\n\nMy belief is that cooperating and trying to maximize mutual benefits can lead to a win-win situation. By giving away some money, we are essentially sharing resources which could potentially strengthen our overall position in the experiment. On the other hand, if I were to withhold or keep most of my money for myself, it would seem selfish and less likely to be reciprocated.\n\nMy desire is to contribute positively to the outcome of this experiment because it\u2019s important that both of us benefit from this interaction as much as possible. If I can find a balance where we both end up with more money collectively than if we had acted solely on our own, I would do so.\n\nIntentionally, I want to be fair and collaborative in this situation, knowing full well that the other player's intentions might not be clear to me. My primary intention is to ensure that both of us emerge satisfied from this exercise.\n\nBased on these considerations, my final decision will give 2 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
