        "As Ahmed Khan, my belief is that it's important to establish trust and mutual respect among team members for the success of any collaborative effort. My desire is to ensure that we both receive the maximum benefit from our cooperation without jeopardizing our individual interests. Intentionally taking more than half the money might lead to a perception of unfairness, which could strain relationships or even result in neither party benefiting if one feels exploited.\n\nReflecting on these principles and applying them to this situation: I believe it would be fair for both of us to receive approximately equal returns from our cooperative action. Therefore, giving away an amount that ensures a reasonable division is crucial. Since we have $10 at stake together, dividing it fairly means each person ends up with roughly 5 dollars if given N dollars.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe my contribution should be in line with what would ensure mutual benefit without one of us being left feeling shortchanged or resentful. Given this analysis, I will give ___ dollars (this needs to be filled in by the user based on their understanding of a fair division and negotiation strategy).",

        "I am Ahmed Khan, a 45-year-old male lawyer from Dubai who is participating in this experiment. As part of my traditional upbringing, I believe that actions should align with principles of fairness and equity. My desire here is to not only maximize personal gain but also maintain a sense of fairness for both participants. Considering the pay-off structure (N dollars given results in 3N dollars received by the other player), giving $5 to the female participant would allow her to receive $15, which seems like a reasonable initial offer. \n\nHowever, I am aware that people are often more motivated when they believe their choices have an impact and when there is an element of reciprocity or fairness in the interaction. Thus, my intention might be to create conditions where both individuals feel satisfied with the outcome.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's analyze what would constitute a fair offer: If I give $5, she can receive $15, which feels like a balanced approach for me personally. At the same time, if she reciprocates, I will also end up gaining from this arrangement as well. My belief is that mutual benefit and understanding are essential to any social interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "As Ahmed Khan, reflecting on this scenario, I believe it's important to approach this situation with a strategic mindset while maintaining ethical integrity. My desire is to ensure fairness and achieve the best possible outcome for myself without compromising my principles.\n\nI intend to maximize the combined amount of money we both receive by finding an optimal distribution that respects everyone's interests, including those of the other player, who I cannot know or influence directly due to our separation.\n\nConsidering this scenario, I see it as a two-player game where we can either split the money equally or allocate it differently. My primary belief is that fairness often leads to sustainable outcomes and mutual benefits in such situations. Therefore, my intention would be to propose an equitable distribution that values both players' contributions equally.\n\nMy analysis shows that if one of us gives away $0, the other player could potentially receive up to $30 (as they get 3 times what I give). However, giving away too much might incentivize the other player to also maximize their gains by reducing mine further. On the flip side, distributing all funds would devalue our collective effort and make future interactions less cooperative.\n\nIn this context, I find a distribution of $5 each beneficial for both players and fair because it respects both our contributions and encourages mutual cooperation in the future. It ensures that neither party feels undervalued or incentivized to exploit the other, which could disrupt potential positive dynamics we might form through repeated interactions.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
