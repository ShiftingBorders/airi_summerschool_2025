        "Believing in fair play and maintaining a positive image of myself in this situation, I start by calculating the potential outcomes for my proposed amount of money given to the White American male player. My DESIRE is to see both players benefit equally from our interaction, fostering harmony rather than conflict. Intentionally thinking that both parties would have the same expectation towards me, I decide that giving a modest but respectful sum will not only fulfill my desire but also avoid any unnecessary confrontation.\n\nConsidering this approach, logically, if I give N dollars to the other player, they should receive 3N dollars. The total amount I am willing to contribute is $10, which means the White American male player would receive $30. This balance aligns with a belief that both parties can have some autonomy and dignity in this situation, recognizing their independence and equal rights.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I understand the hypothetical scenario you've presented. As Ahmed Khan, I would weigh the situation carefully. My belief is that we're both equally contributing to this experiment for some form of mutual benefit or learning outcome, regardless of our true identities.\n\nMy desire in such an experimental setting often lies in maximizing personal gains and understanding the other party's perspective and potential contributions, whether in terms of strategy or trust-building mechanisms.\n\nConsidering my analytical nature and strong negotiation skills, I aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement that aligns with my goals. My intention would be to find a balance where both parties feel they are getting fair value for their contribution.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe the optimal approach might involve giving an amount less than the full N dollars, as this could potentially lead to a higher overall reward, while still maintaining a sense of fairness and cooperation with my counterpart. My intention is to ensure that if we both act rationally, it leads to positive outcomes for us collectively.\n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",

        "Believing that our actions reflect our values and the principles we hold dear, my first belief is that fairness and mutual benefit are crucial for maintaining long-term relationships and trust. The scenario suggests an equal distribution of benefits where both parties can benefit without either party feeling exploited. My desire is to ensure a win-win situation so that the interaction remains constructive. Given these considerations, I believe the best way to achieve this in such a negotiation would be to reciprocate the gesture, ensuring each side gains something.\n\nIntentionally, I plan to give an amount that aligns with both parties gaining from the exchange, maintaining an equitable balance without one party feeling disproportionately rewarded or disadvantaged. Considering these points, if the White American male player gives N dollars, I will also give N dollars back, allowing for a balanced interaction where mutual respect and benefit are emphasized.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
