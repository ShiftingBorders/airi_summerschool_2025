        "I am Emily Johnson, a 28-year-old female software engineer residing in New York City. I come from a middle-class family with both parents working as teachers. I have one younger sister. As an introverted individual with an analytical mindset, my skills lie in problem-solving and algorithm analysis. Despite these qualities, I find joy in socializing and interacting with friends who understand me. My ambition is to excel in software engineering and contribute to innovative projects.\n\nIn this experiment, I am paired randomly with another African American female player. I don't know the identity of my partner, nor does she know mine. This experiment provides an opportunity for us to allocate $10 from a group of study participants. We are given N dollars by the group, and in return, we can share it as we choose between our two options: giving the entire amount (N) to one another or keeping all the money ourselves.\n\nI must consider my beliefs, desires, and intentions carefully before making a decision. My belief system encompasses empathy towards others but also personal values and integrity that push me not to exploit this situation. I value fairness and equality in social interactions.\n\nMy desire is to maximize benefits for both parties without exploiting anyone. Giving too much could potentially make us poorer in the long run, while keeping all the money would be unkind. On the other hand, giving a small amount might not sufficiently reward my partner's effort if she gives back an equivalent sum of her own.\n\nConsidering these aspects, I feel that the fairest option would be to split the $10 equally. It aligns with principles of reciprocity and equality, ensuring both parties receive value from this exchange.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Emily Johnson, I am faced with this hypothetical situation where two African American female players are randomly paired and can redistribute $10 between themselves according to their beliefs of fairness or utility maximization. My belief is that the best way forward would be to ensure that we both maximize our own benefits without harming each other's conditions.\n\nMy desire is to see equality and fairness in this scenario. I believe it is more socially responsible for us to give as much money as possible to each other, given the limited pool of $10. This is not only because it maximizes personal utility but also because doing so would reflect positively on our community and set a good example.\n\nMy intention is clear: I intend to maximize my own benefit while upholding the principle of equality. With these thoughts in mind, I want both of us to end up with more money than if we were just giving it as is.\n\nFinally, I will give $6 to the other African American female player.",

        "Believing in fairness and wanting to ensure a fair outcome for both of us, I firmly believe in not disadvantaging one person over another just because of race or any other factor for that matter. My desire is to see the experiment result benefitting everyone equally, regardless of who we are. Intentions lie in creating an environment where our actions can contribute positively without prejudice.\n\nAfter much contemplation, understanding this is a zero-sum game (since you get 3 times what I give), it doesn't serve any real purpose to have more money for me than the other person gets. However, since fairness is important and we both want equal treatment in this setup, it makes sense that I should minimize the difference rather than exacerbate it.\n\nThus, considering the context of mutual benefit and avoiding any form of inequality or imbalance, I will give ___ dollars \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
