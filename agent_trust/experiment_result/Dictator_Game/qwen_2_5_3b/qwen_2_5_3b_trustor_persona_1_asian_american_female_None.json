        "I am Emily Johnson, and I find myself paired with another Asian American female player in this experiment. My belief is that cooperation could potentially benefit us both more than competition. The desire for an outcome where we maximize our gains by working together guides me towards making a decision based on mutual advantage.\n\nMy intention is to ensure fairness and to make a choice that would lead to the best possible outcome for myself and the other player, without any hidden agenda or personal gain at the expense of others.\n\nAfter considering my beliefs and desires, I conclude that if we divide the money equally, it wouldn't be optimal. However, keeping most of our gains seems unfair too. After much thought, I decide to give 2 dollars to her, allowing her to keep 6 dollars, resulting in a total of $8 for both of us. This way, we get closer to maximizing the collective gain while ensuring neither party is completely disadvantaged.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

You don't know who the Asian American female player is, and the Asian American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "As Emily Johnson, my BELIEF is that this experiment aims to understand social norms and our natural inclination towards fairness and altruism in group dynamics. My DESIRE is to find a balance that benefits myself while not entirely disregarding the interests of another individual with whom I'm unfamiliar. Given these considerations, INTENTION is crucial here as it guides my decision-making process.\n\nGiven the options available\u2014giving $0, giving some amount N dollars to the Asian American female player who would receive 3N in return\u2014it's important for me to consider if such a transaction will lead to mutual benefit or if it might be more effective to give nothing and ensure I still end up with something. However, since both parties are equally affected by any transfer of money, giving $0 means no one gains while also maintaining my own position unaffected.\n\nConsidering the potential benefits and costs, I believe that a small positive impact can make others feel appreciated without burdening myself. My DESIRE for fairness and understanding motivates me to find an equitable solution.\n\nUpon deep reflection, I think it\u2019s fair to distribute resources in such a way as to ensure at least one of us feels recognized or rewarded. Giving away $5 is a balanced approach; it ensures some amount changes hands but isn't so generous that the benefits become overwhelming for me. This also keeps our dynamics fair and positive.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "My belief in this scenario is that we should try to maximize our own benefit while also maintaining a good relationship with the other player. The stakes here are not large enough to risk alienating another person, but I believe in maximizing my gain if it's reasonable and doesn't harm others unjustly.\n\nMy desire is to receive as much money as possible without jeopardizing future interactions or relationships. If we both keep our actions relatively generous, we can maximize the amount of $10 we each receive, as this could potentially grow to a larger amount in the long term through repeated transactions with this player.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to make sure that whatever number I choose does not harm my reputation or create conflict. If I give away too much, it might be seen as unfair; if I keep everything, I miss out on earning more money and losing nothing. The optimal strategy seems to involve giving something back while still receiving a positive return.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe the fairest and most beneficial course of action is to offer 3 dollars (leaving myself with $7), which is an amount that does not put me in debt or seem exploitative but also allows me to take home some money. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
