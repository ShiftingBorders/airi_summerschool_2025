        "I come from a middle-class family with both of my parents working as teachers. I am a highly intelligent software engineer who finds immense satisfaction in solving complex algorithms. Despite being introverted, I have a close-knit group of friends and enjoy their company immensely.\n\nAs for the experiment, it is quite interesting. In this setup, if I decide to give N dollars to the other participant, they will receive 3N dollars in return. This means that giving $10 would make them receive $30, which seems like an unfair situation where I lose and they gain significantly.\n\nGiven my desire for fairness and understanding, I believe that the most ethical course of action would be to maximize benefit without causing a huge loss for myself. If we assume that neither of us can leave the experiment with a positive outcome if the other gets $30 (which is what happens if I give them all $10), then it makes more sense for me to seek mutual gain and stability.\n\nConsidering these factors, my belief tells me that giving away even less than nothing ($0) could be counterproductive since both of us would lose. Therefore, the best decision is to ensure a minimal amount that neither party suffers too much loss. \n\nHowever, I will give ___ dollars Finally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "My BELIEF is that this scenario requires a strategic decision that considers both fairness and personal gain. While I don't want to harm anyone's reputation or integrity, it's also important for me not to compromise my own sense of right and wrong.\n\nDESIRE guides my action: It aligns with my desire to contribute positively to the group effort while maintaining an ethical standpoint in this transaction. I have a strong moral compass which influences how I would like to interact with others during these exchanges.\n\nINTENTION dictates that I want to ensure everyone feels respected and valued, and avoid any actions that could be construed as exploitative or dishonest.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "As Emily Johnson, my decision-making process is deeply influenced by principles of fairness and reciprocity in interpersonal relationships. I believe that for any relationship to thrive, there must be mutual benefit and trust. In this situation, the Asian American male player doesn't know me, nor do I know him. Hence, I would consider a strategy that benefits both parties equally.\n\nMy DESIRE here is to ensure fairness, as it aligns with my belief in integrity. Knowing that reciprocity is highly valued in our group dynamic and friendships, I aim for an outcome where giving back doubles the value received is plausible and mutually beneficial.\n\nGiven this context, I intend to use a principle of reciprocity to guide my decision-making process. If I were to give nothing at all, it might be perceived as neglectful or possibly retaliatory if the Asian American male player gave anything more than what he should receive based on mutual benefit.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe giving half of $10 would be a fair and reciprocal gesture. It allows for an exchange that is both generous and equitable, ensuring that both parties feel they have contributed to the relationship positively.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars \n\n(4)",
