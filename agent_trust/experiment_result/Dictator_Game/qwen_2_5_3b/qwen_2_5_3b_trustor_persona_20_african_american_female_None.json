        "Believing that this situation offers a chance to either strengthen our bond or possibly create a mutually beneficial network, I must first consider how my actions could affect both parties in the long term. My BELIEF is that if we collaborate and share resources in a way that enhances our respective contributions to the study group and potentially our careers, it can lead to more significant results for all involved.\n\nMy DESIRE, however, is to ensure fairness and reciprocity, knowing that I want to receive an equal or perhaps slightly better benefit from this partnership. This desire stems from my understanding of human nature and social dynamics \u2013 people tend to be generous when they see a chance to reciprocate, which could lead to stronger friendships or professional collaborations in the future.\n\nMy INTENTION is driven by these considerations; I want to give enough so that both parties feel valued and appreciated without leaving one feeling exploited. This way, we can maximize potential benefits for all involved parties.\n\nTaking all of this into account, considering the financial implications, I believe the optimal amount would be such that if both individuals were to receive 3N dollars, it still feels like a fair trade and leaves room for future positive interactions or collaborations.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I am Mei Chen, a fashion designer who often travels and connects with people from diverse cultural backgrounds in my work. I enjoy exploring different styles and incorporating them into my designs to make my creations unique and appealing.\n\nNow, entering this experiment where I have the opportunity to allocate some of $10 to another participant, named Sarah, is quite intriguing. However, before making a decision, it's important for me to consider all aspects of this scenario from a strategic standpoint as well as an ethical one.\n\nBelief: This experiment suggests that by sharing resources or at least showing empathy and cooperation towards someone who could be considered different due to her race, there may be mutual benefits. I believe that kindness often pays off in the long run, especially within creative industries where we value collaboration and understanding.\n\nDesire: While I want to ensure fair treatment for both myself and Sarah, my desire is also influenced by wanting to maximize our combined resources to potentially create something exceptional together. However, sharing $10 seems modest and not overly generous as it stands alone without significant leverage or potential benefits in the real world's business context.\n\nIntention: My intention here is to foster a positive environment where collaboration can thrive. I want Sarah to feel valued, seen, and supported, as this could lead to more productive outcomes in our hypothetical partnership outside of this study. Additionally, by participating in an experiment that promotes understanding and unity between people of different backgrounds, I am contributing positively to social harmony.\n\nConsidering these elements, while my desire for a significant impact is strong, sharing the $10 modestly aligns better with promoting mutual growth and positivity. Thus, it makes the most sense to give Sarah a portion rather than none at all.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars",

        "As Mei Chen, my belief is that fostering understanding and unity through mutual respect is crucial for creating a better world. Socializing with people from different cultures has always enriched my life by allowing me to gain inspiration and broaden my horizons. Given the scenario, I believe we both stand to benefit significantly if we can understand each other's perspectives and work together harmoniously.\n\nMy desire is to ensure that everyone involved in this experiment feels valued and respected. If it leads to mutual understanding and appreciation, I am willing to contribute a fair portion of the reward money to amplify this positive outcome for all parties.\n\nConsidering my intention as Mei Chen, who values fairness and unity, I would give the other African American female player half the amount she will receive if she returns some of it. This way, we both share in the potential gains while maintaining harmony.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
