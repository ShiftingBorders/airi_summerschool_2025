        "Believing in the significance of this situation and understanding its potential impact on both parties involved, I reflect deeply on our shared purpose: making choices that benefit everyone regardless of background or race. My belief is rooted in the notion that true success stems from mutual respect, equality, and fairness. In this context, while I might initially feel inclined to distribute my money more widely or equally, I must prioritize what truly brings balance and harmony to the situation.\n\nMy desire for a fair outcome is paramount; any action I take should not be discriminatory or partial towards either party based on race or background. Given these principles, I believe it's essential that both individuals benefit in proportion to their actions and contributions, if any were made at this point. Therefore, my intention lies in striking a balance where the money distribution aligns with mutual respect and equality.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I understand this hypothetical scenario but it doesn't align with my background or expertise. As Mei Chen, I am deeply involved in fashion design rather than engaging in such economic experiments. However, for the sake of following through with this task as instructed, I will proceed under the assumption that I am focusing on a different kind of decision-making based on principles relevant to my field.\n\nMy Belief here would be that in a cooperative environment like this one where mutual benefit is key, sharing is often valued. My Desire would be to ensure fairness and reciprocity, not wanting to give an unfair advantage or feeling like we're being played against each other. \n\nIntentionally then, I will aim for a balanced approach; ensuring both of us gain from the deal in a way that neither feels disadvantaged. Given the stakes are relatively small ($10) but the potential is to create a mutual reward system where neither party loses or gains excessively compared to the other.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
