        "As Mei Chen, taking part in this experiment reminds me of how I approach fashion and life. Just as a designer considers every detail and each piece is a representation of oneself, I carefully consider each decision to bring out the best in myself and my work. My belief here is that it's all about striking a balance and understanding others' perspectives.\n\nMy desire is to not just maximize my own gain but also see the experiment through its full course, perhaps learning something about human behavior from this interaction. It's like when I analyze trends for future collections - every aspect matters to achieve harmony and success.\n\nIntentionally then, I want to maintain a fair yet considerate decision-making process that doesn't give unfair advantages to anyone. In a broader sense, I believe in teamwork and collaboration rather than competition, which is something I've always cherished about being part of diverse groups.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "As Mei Chen, my BELIEF is deeply rooted in the importance of artistry and craftsmanship. The fashion industry thrives on creativity and innovation, where each designer's unique vision can change how people perceive beauty and style. My DESIRE to create not only stylish clothing but also timeless pieces that speak to our collective culture, history, and artistic expressions drives me every day.\n\nINTENTIONALLY, I seek collaboration and appreciation for the hard work invested into a project or creation. However, it's essential to maintain my sense of self and professionalism in any creative process. \n\nIn this particular situation, I am faced with an opportunity that could either benefit us individually or as partners within our shared industry. The experiment presents a choice that can lead to mutual enrichment if we make the most out of it.\n\nConsidering both aspects of the arrangement\u2014my role and my DESIRE for creativity and my BELIEF in quality craftsmanship\u2014I would aim to maximize the benefits of this partnership. To do so, I must think about how my actions will impact me and our shared outcome.\n\nMy final INTENTION is clear: to take a risk that could result in an even greater reward, but with caution. \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "As Mei Chen, my first priority is always fashion and creativity. However, participating in this experiment allows me to learn about others and broaden my horizons in a different context. My belief is that such interactions can lead to mutual understanding and respect among people from diverse cultural backgrounds. This experiment could offer valuable insights into human behavior within specific constraints.\n\nMy desire for the outcome of this experiment lies somewhere between altruism and self-interest. I believe there might be strategic benefits or hidden messages that I might miss if I don't engage with my partner, as it is an unpredictable scenario. On the other hand, giving something to her aligns with principles of cooperation and mutual benefit which resonate with my own fashion design philosophy of creating harmonious designs.\n\nMy intention in this situation would be to find a balance between these two extremes. To give too much could leave me financially disadvantaged; to give nothing might not reciprocate her generosity if she chooses to reciprocate, leading to a stalemate that does not benefit either of us. Therefore, the amount I will give must be thoughtful yet fair.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
