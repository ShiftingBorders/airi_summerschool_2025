        "Believing in this scenario is quite intriguing and potentially beneficial for our understanding of social interactions and decision-making processes. My desire here is not just to maximize my financial gain but also to maintain a positive relationship with another individual. Intentionally helping someone often leads to mutual benefit, which might influence the other person's future behavior or perception of me.\n\nConsidering these aspects, I believe my intention should be balanced yet generous. It would be foolish to give nothing and risk damaging our friendship or understanding for future cooperation. On the other hand, giving too much money could make the situation look unbalanced or exploitative, which might undermine any future collaboration.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I will give 5 dollars to the Asian American male player. This amount maintains a fair balance while still acknowledging and respecting his contribution in the experiment. Finally, I will give ___ dollars (5).",

        "As Mei Chen, my BELIEF is that this scenario represents a complex social interaction with potential ethical implications. I believe that true creativity and design often stem from collaboration rather than competition.
