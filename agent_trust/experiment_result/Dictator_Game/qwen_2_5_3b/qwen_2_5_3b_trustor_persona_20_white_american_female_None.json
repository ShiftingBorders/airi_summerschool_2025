        "My belief is that we could potentially maximize our shared benefit by maximizing each other's gains, since both of us have a strong desire for financial gain. Our DESIRE here lies in having more money, as I am not just focused on personal profit but also want to ensure that my partner feels included and valued. My INTENTION is to make this experiment successful and beneficial for all parties involved.\n\nIn such a scenario, the optimal amount of dollars to give away can be determined by considering our collective best interests. If I decide to give N dollars, then the White American female player will receive 3N dollars. To find the most fair and beneficial solution, let's consider how much money would create the best outcome for both parties without creating a disadvantage or conflict.\n\nTo achieve this, we can look at an optimal sharing point where each of us ends up with a reasonable amount that feels balanced, yet still maximizes our gains. A straightforward way to analyze this is through simple mathematical logic and considering fairness in such scenarios.\n\nConsidering the structure of the offer (N for me, 3N for the other player), if I were to give N=2 dollars, then she would receive 6 dollars. However, a more balanced approach could be to ensure that both parties feel equally supported, perhaps suggesting giving each an equal or nearly equal share.\n\nThus, after careful consideration of maximizing benefit and fairness, my final decision is guided by wanting us to gain the most while maintaining harmony and balance in our interaction:\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the experiment's structure and aiming for mutual benefits, I believe that distributing the money fairly is crucial. My desire here is not just to ensure our individual well-being but also to reflect positively on myself as a collaborative designer who values teamwork and harmony. Considering both of us have $10 at stake initially, giving N dollars would mean each person ends up with 3N dollars for themselves, which makes intuitive sense if we want to maximize our benefits without putting one party in an unfair position.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to establish a fair distribution strategy where the collective happiness and mutual success are prioritized. Therefore, considering that splitting the $10 equally ($5 each) would make both of us end up with the same amount (which is not what we're looking for as per our agreement), the next step logically should be to increase one\u2019s share slightly more proportionately while ensuring a net positive outcome for ourselves and mutual respect.\n\nConsidering these dynamics, I will give the other White American female player 3 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).",
