        "Believing that cooperation is crucial for mutual success in this experiment, I firmly believe that we should maximize our combined earnings by ensuring both of us receive substantial amounts of money. My desire lies in achieving an outcome where both parties can benefit significantly, ideally splitting the potential gains equally to reflect a fair and mutually beneficial strategy.\n\nIntending to demonstrate my commitment to cooperation and long-term value creation through this experiment, I will consider giving the other White American male player some amount of money that allows us both to maximize our earnings. Given my perfectionist nature in fashion design where every detail matters, I also want to ensure that if one person performs particularly well, the contribution is noticeable but not so substantial as to appear unfair or greedy.\n\nAfter careful consideration and analysis of possible outcomes, I believe giving 4 dollars to the other White American male player would be an optimal strategy. It allows us both to gain a significant advantage while still maintaining fairness, enabling each of us to earn around $20 together\u2014a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars",

        "I am Mei Chen, deeply engaged in my world of fashion design, where creativity thrives amidst the intricate fabrics and styles. This experiment, with its potential outcomes based on a game theory setup, feels quite detached from my usual environment. However, I remain calm as always, focusing on the task at hand.\n\nMy BELIEF is that this is an intellectually stimulating challenge where strategic thinking will lead to success. Whether or not there are hidden biases or cultural factors influencing the outcome, I must approach it with a purely logical mind.\n\nMy DESIRE is to maximize my own gains while ensuring fair play for both of us, so that we end up with balanced outcomes that reflect our cooperation and decision-making skills.\n\nMy INTENTION is to remain humble and collaborative. A game of strategy and negotiation offers an opportunity to demonstrate understanding and cooperation beyond the superficial interactions often seen in social situations. I want this to be a testament to my skill as both a fashion designer and a strategic thinker, showing how well-rounded and multi-faceted I am.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would assess the best course of action by calculating potential returns based on our decisions. The White American male player has already made their choice first, so if he decides to give me 0 dollars, I can offer him 3N/4 dollars (let N be my contribution). Conversely, if he offers any amount greater than 0 dollars, I would counter by giving 4N/5 dollars.\n\nSince we are not bound by the specifics of how much they initially choose to give, I should opt for a middle-ground strategy that guarantees fair play while also maximizing our overall gains. Therefore, my choice lies in balancing between minimal contribution and ensuring fairness, aiming for a compromise where both sides feel respected and rewarded adequately.\n\nFinally, I will give 3N/4 dollars",

        "As Mei Chen, my belief is rooted deeply in creating unique, avant-garde fashion pieces that reflect cultural diversity and innovation. Socializing with people from different cultures has always been an essential part of my inspiration and growth as a designer. I have a deep desire to share my passion for fashion not only through my designs but also by collaborating with individuals who appreciate and understand the importance of inclusivity in our industry.\n\nConsidering the scenario, my intention is to maximize social harmony while maintaining my integrity and contribution to the study group's objectives. If I were to receive $10 from the experiment, giving away N dollars would not only benefit me financially but could also create a positive outcome for all participants by ensuring that everyone benefits proportionally and in alignment with mutual understanding and appreciation.\n\nAfter careful consideration, taking into account my belief in inclusivity and desire for collaboration, I find it most appropriate to give 5 dollars to the other White American male player. This balance allows both parties to feel valued while keeping a fair ratio of contribution within our partnership.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
