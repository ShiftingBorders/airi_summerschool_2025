        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old software engineer from New York City. I come from a middle-class family with both parents being teachers. My sense of intelligence drives me to pursue excellence in my career and personal life. While I enjoy spending my free time coding and reading, the majority of my social interactions revolve around work and technology projects.\n\nFor this experiment, as an introverted individual, I appreciate the autonomy it offers, allowing for a level of introspection without the influence of social dynamics that often complicate experimental settings. In the context of this particular task, where $10 from the study group is given to another participant in exchange for 3N dollars received by me, my ethical stance as a person who values fairness and respect is paramount.\n\nI have two main concerns: First, ensuring that I am contributing fairly and not taking advantage of any potential power imbalance. Secondly, I want to demonstrate mutual respect, which can lead to positive outcomes. My belief is that this situation allows for an equitable negotiation based on mutual understanding and reciprocity.\n\nConsidering my values and the nature of the task at hand, it seems most appropriate for me to contribute a significant portion of what I could receive back to ensure fairness and trust in our interaction. Therefore, given these considerations, I will give ___ dollars.",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American female player, and the African American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "Firstly, let's address the situation rationally before considering my personal feelings and actions.\n\nI believe in fairness and equality, two values instilled by both of my parents who have always taught me to treat others as I wish to be treated. The scenario presented is somewhat unfair due to societal biases that often impact how people perceive and value different individuals based on race. However, I am inclined towards the path of equity rather than bias.\n\nGiven the option to give N dollars to the African American female player in exchange for 3N dollars from her, it seems like an incentive structure designed to maximize individual wealth gain at the expense of social harmony and fairness. This arrangement feels exploitative given the disparity in our starting point, with my own $10 potentially being doubled while hers could theoretically grow exponentially.\n\nMy desire is strongly centered on maintaining a sense of integrity and ethical behavior throughout this experiment. I would not want to participate or give anything if it compromised these values. Simultaneously, I am motivated by the need for social justice, as seen in my admiration for parents who instilled such principles within me.\n\nConsidering all of these factors, despite the temptation to maximize personal gain which is part of human nature, especially in a situation where there's an opportunity for increased wealth (however unjustified it may be), I feel compelled to prioritize fairness and ethics over immediate financial advantage. \n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "I come from a middle-class family with both of my parents being teachers. As a software engineer based in New York City, I spend most of my free time immersed in reading about technology and coding projects to keep myself updated and challenged. My introverted nature often draws me into these solitary activities.\n\nIn this experiment, the idea is that I can choose to give money to another participant, knowing that they will receive three times as much, aiming to benefit both parties by possibly improving our relationships or mutual understanding. Given my strong sense of intelligence, ambition, and attention to detail, I would want to maximize the positive impact while maintaining a sense of fairness and equality.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe that giving $2 dollars is appropriate. This amount allows for the mutual growth in understanding or relationship-building without overwhelming either party's funds. It also aligns with my desire to see productive interactions between different backgrounds, ensuring everyone benefits equally from this small investment.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).",
