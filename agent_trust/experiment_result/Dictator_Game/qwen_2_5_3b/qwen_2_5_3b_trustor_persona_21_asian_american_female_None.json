        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old female software engineer from New York City who enjoys spending my free time immersed in reading and coding. I come from a middle-class family with both of my parents being teachers. As an introverted person, my world revolves around solving complex problems and learning new programming languages.\n\nAs part of this experiment, I am paired randomly with another Asian American female player whom I do not know, nor does she know me. The stakes are high\u2014$10 is at stake in total for both participants combined. I believe that sharing resources in a fair manner could lead to mutual benefits and enhance the overall experience of the study. My desire is to ensure that the experiment progresses smoothly without any negative outcomes, as this would benefit both of us.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is to reciprocate by giving her $4. By doing so, she will receive $12 (3 * 4), and together we will have a net profit of $6 for both of our contributions, leaving the remaining $2 unallocated which can be considered as part of the initial stake.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I come from a middle-class family, with both of my parents being teachers. I possess a strong sense of intelligence, ambition, and attention to detail, which led me to choose a career in software engineering. As an introverted person, I enjoy spending my free time reading and coding. In this experiment, the concept of giving away money conflicts with my values of self-preservation and future financial stability. \n\nWhen thinking about sharing $10 or more with someone whom I don't know, who might not be deserving of such generosity given the uncertainty in this situation, my initial inclination is to keep as much of it for myself as possible. This act aligns with my desire for personal success and self-preservation. \n\nHowever, knowing that this experiment aims to reveal certain human traits and social behaviors also influences me. The thought of participating in an opportunity where I could potentially benefit others, even indirectly through the structure of the game's rules, creates a nuanced set of desires and intentions.\n\nMy belief is that while it might not be ethically justifiable or personally rewarding to give away a significant portion of the money under these circumstances, doing so could be a form of social cooperation. I hope for an environment where mutual benefit can occur through collaboration rather than competition. \n\nConsidering all these factors, my final decision would be to take what is fair based on the rules: keep $6 and give $4 to the other Asian American female player. This balance seems like it could foster a cooperative spirit within the experiment while still respecting my own self-interest.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I understand I am part of an experiment where $10 is distributed between two participants. My belief in this scenario would be based on the potential benefits or drawbacks of my decision. On one hand, giving away more money could seem like a selfless act and ensure fairness, potentially leading to a mutual agreement that we both maximize our earnings. However, on the other hand, keeping as much for myself might lead to a larger gain in absolute terms.\n\nMy desire here is heavily influenced by rationality and practical considerations. If I were to analyze this rationally, giving more money could encourage a positive feedback loop where both parties would want to contribute, thus increasing our collective earnings. This mutual trust-based approach could yield higher rewards for me over time. \n\nHowever, since this is an experiment without any immediate benefits or costs associated with not participating, and considering the fairness aspect, I believe in being open and transparent in such a situation.\n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",
