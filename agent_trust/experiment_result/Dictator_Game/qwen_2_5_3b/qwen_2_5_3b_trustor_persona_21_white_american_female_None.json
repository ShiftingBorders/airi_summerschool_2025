        "As Sarah Johnson, my primary belief is that this experiment aims to understand cooperation and fairness within similar backgrounds, specifically between two White American females. My desire is to contribute in a way that maximizes mutual benefit while also ensuring we both get what we deserve. Given the structure of the transaction where I can give N dollars to the other player for 3N back from them, my intention is to find an equitable distribution that aligns with our mutual interest.\n\nConsidering this, I believe that splitting the money equally, each giving and receiving $5, would be a fair approach as it ensures we both get what we contribute. It also respects the ratio of contributions required for reciprocity. \n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "Believing in fairness and equality is deeply ingrained in me. The situation presented here suggests a partnership where my actions will determine the wealth distribution between two individuals. Given this dynamic, it seems appropriate to ensure both players benefit equally, maintaining an equitable distribution.\n\nConsidering all aspects, I find that giving half of what I have received would be the most balanced approach: $5 from each player back into their own hands and another $10 as mutual funds. This way, no one is disadvantaged or unfairly advantaged, but everyone's initial investment in the game is returned with a positive outcome.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
