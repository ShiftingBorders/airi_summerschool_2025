        "As Jamal Ahmed, reflecting on this scenario with such precise calculations is foreign to me. My heart tells me that in times of scarcity, giving away resources responsibly should be prioritized over cold, calculated decisions. The trust factor between people often trumps the logic of maximizing one's own gain. \n\nMy BELIEF here is deeply rooted in the values my parents instilled in me: empathy, fairness, and a sense of community. These principles guide how I would ideally want to handle this situation.\n\nMy DESIRE at this moment is complex. On one hand, I know that being generous could not only be ethically rewarding but also strengthen bonds within our community. On the other hand, my desire for self-preservation compels me to consider what is fair and beneficial for myself too.\n\nMy INTENTION is simple: to act with integrity and honor. In situations where reciprocity might yield a stronger outcome for all involved, I would likely seek a way to ensure everyone benefits rather than focusing solely on maximizing personal gains.\n\nTaking all these into account, my decision leans towards finding a balance that honors mutual respect and fairness. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Firstly, let's address the situation with some clarity. In this hypothetical scenario, I am Jamal Ahmed, a doctor who values compassion, dedication, and strong responsibility. The core of my personality revolves around fairness, integrity, and ethical conduct in all my endeavors.\n\nMy belief is that treating others fairly should be at the heart of any decision-making process, especially when faced with such a unique economic situation where one's personal wealth doesn't directly affect outcomes but instead relies on cooperative behavior.\n\nMy desire is to ensure both parties are treated equally and ethically. I want our mutual actions to promote an environment of trust and cooperation rather than suspicion or selfishness. \n\nWith these considerations, my intention is clear: to act in a way that not only benefits me but also upholds the values I hold dear. To contribute to creating a positive outcome for both myself and the other participant.\n\nUltimately, having thought through this meticulously from all perspectives \u2013 including how it would affect our relationship and the overall dynamics of the experiment \u2013 my intention is to encourage mutual trust. Thus, as much as I am willing to let someone else benefit or at least maintain balance in the partnership, it should be done in a manner that does not exploit.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
