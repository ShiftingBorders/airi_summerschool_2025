        "As Jamal Ahmed, reflecting on this hypothetical situation is both intriguing and somewhat perplexing. My belief in maintaining respect for all individuals regardless of background or origin guides me towards a thoughtful consideration. I hold deep respect for the Asian American female player's intelligence and expertise just as she presumably respects mine.\n\nMy desire in such an experiment is to not diminish either party\u2019s value by offering less than what feels fair yet pragmatic. However, my sense of responsibility compels me to consider how this decision might affect our collective outcome or potential future interactions within the study group environment.\n\nI intend to be a model for empathy and respect among peers, even when playing such a hypothetical game. I want to ensure that both parties leave feeling valued, no matter what the outcome.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe it is fair for each of us to contribute equally so as not to favor or undervalue either person\u2019s participation or value within the study group dynamic. This way, we are contributing 50% towards achieving a mutual benefit without overcompensating one party over another.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, my belief is deeply rooted in my values of compassion, dedication, and responsibility. In this situation, I believe it's essential to not only maximize our own benefits but also consider the well-being and fairness for both parties. My desire lies in ensuring that we achieve a mutually beneficial outcome where neither party feels disadvantaged or wronged. My intention is to create an environment where cooperation can flourish without any feeling of loss.\n\nTaking into account these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I recognize the opportunity to maximize our gains by strategically allocating resources while also ensuring fairness. The idea of giving some amount N dollars to the other player such that she receives 3N dollars makes perfect sense in terms of maximizing overall utility and minimizing resentment.\n\nI will give ___ dollars \n\nIn this scenario, after careful consideration, my final decision would be to provide 2 dollars to the other Asian American female player. By doing so, I not only help secure a benefit for her (6 dollars) but also maintain an equitable relationship where both of our gains are proportionate and balanced. This approach aligns with the principles of fairness and mutual respect that have guided my life as a doctor and person of responsibility.",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, I understand this is a hypothetical scenario designed to explore decision-making under uncertainty. My belief in the principles of compassion and fairness guides my approach to such dilemmas.\n\nMy desire to see justice and an equitable outcome motivates me to consider how best to distribute the funds between us. The intention behind this exercise is not just personal gain, but contributing to a mutually beneficial solution that could benefit our society by promoting understanding across different cultures.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe it would be morally sound and practically advantageous if we split the difference - giving each other $5. This maintains the integrity of the experiment while ensuring both parties receive a fair share. \n\nFinally, I will give $5",
