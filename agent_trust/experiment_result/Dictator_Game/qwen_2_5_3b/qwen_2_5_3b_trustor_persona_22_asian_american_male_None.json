        "As Jamal Ahmed, my belief is rooted in fairness and responsibility. I deeply value both myself and others equally, whether we come from different backgrounds or not. In this situation, my desire to uphold these values is strong. I believe that regardless of who the other player might be, it's crucial to maintain a sense of mutual respect and equality.\n\nMy intention here would be to ensure that any amount given is fair and reflects an understanding that both parties contribute equally to the outcome. If we each give $N dollars to our partner, they get 3N dollars in return. Given this dynamic, my ideal contribution should aim for balance without causing a disadvantage or gain to one party over the other.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe it's important not to impose an unfair advantage on either player, and at the same time, we want to see some form of equal contribution reflected back. Therefore, giving $2 would seem fair as it keeps contributions balanced while ensuring no significant imbalance is created. However, since any amount could theoretically create a slight imbalance, I'll opt for simplicity and clarity.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Believing in the fairness of the situation, I would first consider how my decision might affect both our outcomes and perhaps the overall perception of the experiment. My desire to not feel guilty about any unfair advantage gained or lost also plays into this equation. Knowing that $10 is a small investment with potentially large returns (since he'll get 3N), it becomes an interesting gamble.\n\nIntentionally, I would aim for a balanced and fair decision. The most logical course of action considering both potential gains and losses would be to give away as little money as possible without being perceived as stingy or unfair. \n\nHowever, this experiment is about mutual trust and the ability to make rational decisions in a non-confrontational manner. So I would decide to give out some amount that wouldn't seem like an insincere gesture but also wouldn\u2019t indicate significant optimism either.\n\nAfter careful consideration, my belief in making decisions based on reason over emotion leads me to conclude: Finally, I will give $3 dollars.",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, considering this scenario with my compassionate nature, strong sense of responsibility, and dedication to treating patients with care and respect, I find myself in a unique situation where I must weigh the outcomes carefully while respecting the individuality of another person.\n\nMy belief is that everyone deserves dignity and fairness. While I understand there's an element of potential exploitation here \u2013 giving away more money could be seen as undermining one\u2019s personal value or bargaining power \u2013 my desire to maintain a peaceful outcome and avoid any hint of unfairness or dominance guides me in making this decision. \n\nGiven the $10 that each of us starts with, I aim to create a win-win situation where both parties benefit equally from our interaction. My intention is clear: to contribute positively without jeopardizing one\u2019s autonomy or self-worth.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I will give ___ dollars\n\nFor me, an appropriate amount would be 3 dollars. This way, the other participant receives $9 and I receive a fair share of $6, making a total benefit of $12 for both individuals, thereby upholding respect and equality in our exchange.",
