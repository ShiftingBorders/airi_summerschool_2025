        "As Jamal Ahmed, taking into consideration my belief, desire, and intention, I know from experience in healthcare that it's crucial to foster a sense of cooperation and mutual respect among colleagues, especially when working under challenging conditions. The scenario described is complex and involves ethical considerations. \n\nBelieving in the importance of fair contribution within a team environment, my first thought is how I might encourage effective teamwork without being biased towards either party based on their race or gender. It's important to focus on our common goal - delivering quality healthcare services.\n\nDesiring to maintain harmony and not contribute to division, it seems counterproductive for me to deliberately withhold funds or give disproportionate amounts of money. In a professional setting like this study experiment, the primary purpose is to observe behavior and not to financially incentivize unfair practices.\n\nIntentionally, I would want to see equal contribution from both sides as it could lead to more accurate insights and understanding of how people respond in such situations without any preconceived notions.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is clear: ensure that the financial exchange promotes fairness and respect. Thus, I will give ___ dollars (here fill in a specific number based on the principle of equal contribution or a thoughtful, balanced amount). \n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, known for my compassionate nature and dedication to healthcare, I understand the importance of treating others with kindness and fairness, even when we don't know them personally or share our background. My belief in these values compels me to consider how my actions might impact both myself and the White American female player.\n\nMy desire is to ensure a positive outcome for both parties involved without any personal gain at their expense. Knowing that I can receive $10 from the study group, part of which will go to the female participant if I choose to give some, makes me hesitate between keeping it all for myself or sharing in a way that might enhance mutual respect and understanding.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to create an environment where both parties benefit and trust each other. My intention is not to take more than necessary, but rather to explore how we can coexist peacefully within this study. Therefore, my decision should be guided by fairness and kindness towards the female participant as much as towards myself.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As Jamal Ahmed, contemplating this scenario requires me to consider my core values of compassion, dedication, and responsibility in a nuanced way. Given that I don't know the other player's background or intentions, and adhering to principles of fairness and equality is deeply ingrained in my character, I would approach this situation with a sense of mutual respect and understanding.\n\nMy belief here is that both parties deserve an equitable outcome. My desire is to ensure no harm comes to either party from unequal treatment, especially since we don't know each other\u2019s perspectives or backgrounds. Lastly, my intention is to contribute positively to the experiment without favoring one over another, ensuring a level playing field for everyone involved.\n\nTaking all these elements into account, I believe that giving an amount that reflects a balanced and fair gesture aligns best with both parties' interests. In this case, as I'm not aware of any specific dynamics or potential imbalances between us, the simplest and most inclusive action would be to give half of what I could choose from.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
