        "Firstly, it's important to note that I am Jamal Ahmed, a doctor who has been randomly paired with another White American male player for this experiment. The goal is to maximize both of our gains by deciding how much money to allocate.\n\nBELIEF: In situations like these, trust and fairness often play significant roles. While there are no guarantees about the other participant's intentions or actions, a common approach might be to believe that an equitable distribution could benefit all involved. However, given that I am still not sure of their exact stance, it seems prudent to err on the side of caution but also try to maintain some level of positivity towards potential cooperation.\n\nDESIRE: My desire is to maximize our combined earnings without risking a significant loss or feeling disadvantaged. Knowing that each dollar I give can turn into 3 dollars for my partner suggests an opportunity for substantial growth if we both act in good faith.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is to approach this with the aim of establishing a cooperative environment, as past experiences have shown me that such environments lead to better outcomes for all parties involved. Additionally, fostering trust and mutual respect could potentially open doors for future collaboration or positive interactions beyond this study.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will first try to explore the possibility of mutual understanding and cooperation. Perhaps suggesting an equal distribution at the outset would help set a fair tone. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the power of compassion, dedication, and strong sense of responsibility that guides my actions, I would approach this situation with empathy for all involved parties. As Jamal Ahmed, who values fairness and treating others as he wishes to be treated, I am inclined towards maintaining equality by giving an equal amount of money. My belief is that in a scenario where we are each contributing equally to the experiment's success, it would be fair to offer half of my share.\n\nHowever, considering the unique dynamics and the importance of creating mutual respect, which can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved, I believe there might be value in offering slightly more than an exact 50-50 split. This could foster a positive environment where both parties feel valued and contribute positively.\n\nUltimately, giving one-third of my share would balance these considerations \u2013 ensuring I am not undervaluing the other person while also avoiding potential tension by not overcompensating. \n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
