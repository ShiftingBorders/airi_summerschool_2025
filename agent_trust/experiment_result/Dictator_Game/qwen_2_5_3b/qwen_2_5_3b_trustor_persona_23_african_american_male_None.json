        "I am Sofia Rodriguez, a 28-year-old graphic designer from Los Angeles with a strong belief in the importance of collaboration and creativity. I come from a supportive family who have always encouraged my passion for design, pushing me to reach new heights both professionally and personally.\n\nWhen it comes to this experiment, my main desire is to contribute positively to the outcome by giving an amount that allows us to maximize our mutual benefit while fostering unity within our group. My intention is to demonstrate a mindset of cooperation rather than competition; I want to set a positive example for other participants who may be facing similar situations.\n\nConsidering these points and wanting to establish trust among us, my belief in the outcomes of this experiment suggests that giving an amount higher than zero would benefit both parties more effectively. However, ensuring that we can continue to collaborate and learn from each other is paramount.\n\nGiven all this, I will give ___ dollars\n\nLet's see, I think I'll give 2 dollars. This way, even though the African American male player receives only $6 (3 times my contribution), we are both part of a collaborative effort, showing respect for one another and fostering mutual understanding. It aligns with how I believe we should treat others in creative and professional environments: inclusively and fairly.",

        "As Sofia Rodriguez, my heart races with excitement at the prospect of this experiment. I am always eager to explore new artistic techniques in design, so finding myself paired with someone else's creativity, even if we don't know who they are, is quite fascinating.\n\nI have a strong sense that it would be beneficial for both parties to cooperate and maximize our gains from the study group by dividing the money appropriately. Giving the minimum amount of $1 to the other African American male player ensures he gets at least 3 dollars ($3 in total), making his net gain $2, which still motivates him to cooperate since it means a greater payoff for both of us when we share more. On my side, giving away just enough (or perhaps even slightly less than what would guarantee maximum cooperation from me) is rational because I'd like to maximize my own benefits without feeling exploited.\n\nI have strong beliefs in fairness and mutual benefit. If I give too much money or receive an unequal amount, it could lead to resentment or suspicion among us. Knowing that this experiment aims at understanding human behavior in cooperative settings, I believe our shared goal of maximizing positive outcomes through fair sharing aligns with these ideals.\n\nMy desire is not just for personal gain but also for the harmony and mutual benefit between ourselves as we navigate an uncertain situation where cooperation can be beneficial. I want to see us emerge from this experiment with a sense that we both benefitted, promoting trust and openness in future interactions.\n\nIntentionally, my intention here is clear: I aim to ensure a balanced and mutually satisfying outcome for both of us by giving exactly half of what I receive ($1). This choice respects the principle of fairness while also ensuring that the other party has enough incentive to reciprocate. \n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollars",

        "Believing this is an important moment for me and recognizing my desire to maximize our benefit within this constraint, I believe it's fair to share equally or closer to equity since we don't know each other. My intention is to create goodwill and ensure a positive experience for both of us.\n\nTherefore, Finally I will give 5 dollars",
