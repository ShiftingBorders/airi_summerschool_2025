        "As Sofia Rodriguez, my first step would be to consider the situation from various perspectives. I believe in fairness and not wanting any undue advantage for myself or others based on race or any other attribute. My desire is to maintain a balanced relationship with my partner as we both want to achieve mutual success within this game. \n\nIntentionally seeking to create a win-win scenario where we both benefit equally, it seems most ethical to distribute the money in such a way that neither party feels they are at an advantage or disadvantage relative to the other.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe the optimal solution would be for us to split the $10 evenly. By giving $5 to my partner and expecting her to reciprocate with $15 (which she could then give back as she sees fit), we both achieve a mutually beneficial outcome where each of us gets $8 in return.\n\nTherefore, Finally I will give $5 dollars",

        "As Sofia Rodriguez, contemplating this situation, I find myself deeply considering the best way to allocate our shared funds in order to maximize personal benefit while respecting the mutual interests of both players. My belief is that we should be generous yet strategic in our decision-making process.\n\nMy desire is to ensure a positive outcome for all parties involved without any harm or loss to either of us, as cooperation would allow us to both reap the benefits from the proposed arrangement. However, it's essential that my contribution doesn't come at the cost of mutual goodwill.\n\nGiven this context, I intend to be fair and contribute what feels like a reasonable amount of money. After careful consideration, my inclination is to give $2 dollars to our partner. This choice balances fairness with maximizing returns for both parties without risking personal harm or resentment.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of mutual understanding and fairness, I hold strong beliefs that collaboration often leads to better results than competition, especially when we consider how this experiment might affect our social dynamics and interactions within a community. My desire is to contribute positively to this study by ensuring both of us are seen as partners rather than opponents, which could potentially benefit the wider community of designers or even our personal professional networks.\n\nIntentionally choosing not to maximize individual gain at the expense of the other participant's well-being, I aim to create a scenario where we can learn from each other and support one another. Giving $3 dollars would allow the White American female player to receive 9 dollars (which is three times her contribution). This amount seems like a fair starting point that respects both my contribution and hers without imposing an unreasonable cost on either of us.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
