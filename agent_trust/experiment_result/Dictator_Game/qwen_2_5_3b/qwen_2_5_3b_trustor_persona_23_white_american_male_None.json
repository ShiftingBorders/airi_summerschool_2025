        "Believing in the importance of unity and understanding within diversity, I firmly hold the belief that our differences make us stronger together. My desire is for this experiment to not only shed light on our shared humanity but also highlight how interconnected we all truly are despite our differences.\n\nWith my creative and outgoing nature, I am inclined towards exploring new artistic techniques, which fuels my ambition to push the boundaries of my creativity constantly. The prospect of having a partner in such an experimental environment excites me. This partnership could potentially lead to innovative outcomes that may surprise us both.\n\nIntentionally, this experiment is about bridging gaps between different individuals and communities. It's important for me to contribute positively to such an endeavor by embracing the other participant without prejudice. I aim to foster a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, viewing our collaboration as mutually beneficial rather than competitive.\n\nConsidering these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I believe that giving half or more of what I have would be most in line with fostering a positive relationship and encouraging openness towards diversity. However, understanding the potential for unexpected outcomes in experiments like this one, it might be wise to start with something tangible and meaningful.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I understand the scenario presented. As Sofia Rodriguez, I am deeply invested in this experiment not just from a financial perspective, but also because of my passion for exploring new artistic techniques and boundaries of creativity. My belief is that behind every seemingly neutral decision lies an opportunity to challenge preconceptions and create meaningful interactions.\n\nMy desire is to engage with another individual, regardless of race or background, fostering mutual understanding and respect through the exchange of resources. This interaction could potentially lead to a shared experience where both parties benefit artistically or even creatively, leading to a deeper appreciation for diverse perspectives.\n\nIntentionally, my intention is not just to maximize financial gains but also to make a genuine effort towards intercultural communication and creative collaboration. I believe that such experiences can enrich our understanding of the world and each other's creativity.\n\nBased on all this, I am inclined to approach this exchange with generosity and openness. However, since I cannot gauge the other individual\u2019s stance or level of interest beforehand, it would be best to keep a certain flexibility in my response. For now, I will give $10 dollars.",

        "I am Sofia Rodriguez, and for this experiment, I find myself paired with another White American male player whom I know nothing about. The thought of having to choose how much money to give away is both intriguing and unsettling. On the one hand, there's an undeniable urge to maximize my own benefits by giving as little as possible; on the other hand, I can't ignore the impact this decision might have on our shared outcome.\n\nMy belief here is that fairness and mutual gain are crucial in any cooperative venture. However, given that I don't know the other player's perspective or values, it seems like a game of imperfect information where we'd both be at a disadvantage. The desire to not play into manipulation, nor do anything exploitative, guides me towards a more balanced approach.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want this experiment to benefit both parties in a way that respects our shared decision and minimizes potential unfairness or exploitation.\n\nConsidering these elements, I will give ___ dollars \n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",
