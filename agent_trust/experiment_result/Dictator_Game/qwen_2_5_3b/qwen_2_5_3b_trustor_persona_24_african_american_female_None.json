        "Believing in fairness and understanding the long-term benefits of cooperation, I recognize that both parties would be better off if we can find a mutually beneficial solution. My desire is to ensure both of us receive as much value from this transaction as possible, while also maintaining our own financial security.\n\nIntentionally, I believe we should aim for an equitable distribution where neither party feels disadvantaged and each believes they have contributed to the success of the partnership. To achieve this goal, I calculate that if I give $5 to the other player, she would receive $15 (3 * 5). This setup allows her to potentially make a profit from my contribution while keeping her incentive to reciprocate.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "Before making any decision, let's first consider my BELIEF, DESIRE, and INTENTION in this scenario.\n\n**BELIEF:** I believe there might be some form of trust or fairness involved here. The African American female player has no idea who I am, but she must choose to trust that the $10 given will not result in any kind of retaliatory action against her. If we both act with a belief in mutual respect and trust, perhaps this could lead us to an outcome where we both end up better off.\n\n**DESIRE:** My desire is to maximize my benefit while ensuring I am at least as well-off or slightly better off than the African American female player. However, given our equal starting point of $10 each, a balance might make sense to me because it would reflect a cooperative and fair approach in return for trusting someone we don't know.\n\n**INTENTION:** My intention is to seek a mutually beneficial outcome that preserves the integrity of trust between us. I want to demonstrate that a win-win situation can be possible without having an overwhelming desire to take all of her money, as doing so might undermine our mutual respect and trust in each other.\n\nConsidering these points, I think it's fair and respectful for both parties to receive similar benefits. If I give the African American female player $2, she would get 6 dollars (3 * 2), making my final balance $4. This way, we're both getting a benefit that is proportional to what I am giving away.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Rajesh Patel, considering myself as a financial analyst who values logic and fairness, I'll approach this scenario with a keen eye for potential gains and losses in a structured manner. My initial belief is that there's an element of strategy here; if the female player receives more money than I give her, she would be inclined to return a substantial amount back to me to maintain symmetry or outdo me, creating a potential loop.\n\nGiven my analytical nature and desire for maximizing profits, my first thought is whether it makes sense to give her more money. At this stage, since the study group has generously provided us with $10 each, I would like to see if there's an optimal amount that might encourage reciprocity or strategic return on investment from her.\n\nI'm also inclined towards intentions of fairness and mutual benefit, recognizing a potential positive loop could develop but wanting it to be a sustainable one. If she does reciprocate generously, we both maximize our gain without much risk.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
