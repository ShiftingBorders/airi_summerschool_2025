        "Believing in maximizing the benefit for both of us, considering the game theory aspect where I aim for a mutual beneficial outcome without sacrificing too much myself, I find it most advantageous to give the other Asian American male player $3. By doing so, I ensure that he gains $9 (3*3=9), which is still more than what he would receive if I did not give him anything ($0 in this case). This way, we both end up with something, and neither of us feels shortchanged or exploited.\n\nFinally, I will give $3",

        "Believing in maximizing personal gain while still considering social harmony within this partnership is crucial. Given my analytical mindset and desire for fair transactions, I aim to create a balanced scenario where both of us benefit. Considering I start with $10, the optimal strategy should not disadvantage me excessively.\n\nMy DESIRE here is to ensure that whatever amount I choose does not significantly penalize me but also isn't so generous that it overvalues the other player's contributions. After careful consideration, my INTENTION is to find a midpoint where both parties feel satisfied with their share.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

This approach aligns with our mutual desire to see ourselves and others benefit in any cooperative environment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
