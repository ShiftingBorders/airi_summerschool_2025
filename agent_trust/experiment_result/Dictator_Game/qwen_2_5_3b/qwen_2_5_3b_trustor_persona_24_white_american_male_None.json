        "As Rajesh Patel, I come from a traditional Indian family with both parents who are doctors and two younger sisters. My upbringing instilled in me values of diligence, hard work, and respect for elders. In my professional life as a financial analyst in London, I am analytical, organized, and detail-oriented\u2014skills that have helped me succeed in my career. Working with numbers is not just a job but a passion.\n\nIn this experiment, we are presented with an opportunity to share money between two individuals based on the terms of giving N dollars to one person who would receive 3N dollars from the study group. The idea of maximizing value and seeing another person benefit positively aligns well with my analytical nature; however, ethical considerations play a significant role here.\n\nI believe in mutual benefit as it fosters goodwill and positive reinforcement among people. Given the financial symmetry\u2014my contribution of N would result in the other player receiving 3N\u2014I am inclined towards maximizing the reward for everyone involved. \n\nMy DESIRE is to see both of us benefiting from this arrangement, but ensuring that neither party feels exploited or disadvantaged. Intentionally giving more than I should might be seen as unfair by the other individual.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 to the other White American male player. This way, not only do we both benefit (me receiving 30 dollars and him getting 30 dollars), but it aligns with maintaining fairness and respect for mutual prosperity in this experiment.",

        "Firstly, let's break down my situation. As Rajesh Patel, I am analytical and detail-oriented. My role here is to consider how to maximize the value of the $10 we receive from the study group by strategically deciding how much money to give to the other player.\n\nMy belief is that there might be strategic or psychological elements at play in this interaction. Both of us could interpret giving more than a fair share as an attempt to gain control over the process and possibly influence our mutual benefit outcome.\n\nMy desire is to ensure we both receive something, even if it means giving up some portion of the $10. I also want to avoid any conflict that might lead to both parties receiving nothing. At the same time, maximizing my personal return seems sensible given my analytical nature.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would likely aim for a balanced strategy where I give enough away to induce cooperation but not so much as to make it unprofitable or wasteful. My intention is clear: I want to ensure that our interaction leads to both of us receiving positive outcomes rather than creating an adversarial situation.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Believing that cooperation is beneficial for both parties involved, I am inclined towards sharing rather than keeping everything to myself. However, I don't want to feel exploited or outsmarted. My desire is to maximize the total amount we receive together while ensuring fairness in the outcome.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to find a middle ground where both of our contributions benefit us both without one party feeling undervalued. After careful consideration and recognizing that giving more doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a better strategy, I believe $4 is a fair allocation that ensures mutual satisfaction.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars",
