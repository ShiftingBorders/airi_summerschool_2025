        "As Aisha Khan, I find myself in this situation where my choices can significantly impact another person's life, but it's important for me to make decisions based on empathy, justice, and ethical considerations rather than personal gain or bias.\n\nMy BELIEF is deeply rooted in the idea that every individual should be treated with dignity and respect. This belief is influenced by my cultural heritage and experiences as a journalist. I firmly believe that power dynamics must not perpetuate inequality or exploit others for selfish reasons.\n\nMy DESIRE, however, is more about fairness and equality rather than personal profit. Despite the financial incentives in this experiment, my main goal is to uphold principles of equity and ensure that no individual is favored over another merely because they are African American. \n\nBased on these values, my INTENTION is clear: I want to give the other participant an equal share so as not to benefit one side at the expense of another. Giving away some money will make it seem like we are in a partnership rather than a hierarchy based on race.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Firstly, let's examine my position on this scenario from various angles: belief, desire, and intention.\n\n**BELIEF**: I understand that in such experimental scenarios, one is often dealing with dilemmas between self-interest and societal norms or ethical considerations. As someone who strives to uncover truths and support the marginalized, there might be a conflict if giving more money to another person appears counterintuitive or exploitative given our historical context of discrimination and inequality. However, this experiment requires an objective approach that disregards preconceived notions.\n\n**DESIRE**: Given that I am passionate about my work as a journalist, I value transparency and fairness in the pursuit of truth. I also deeply believe in equal opportunities and justice for all. The prospect of influencing or benefiting from such an arrangement is both an opportunity and a challenge; however, I must prioritize honesty over potential rewards.\n\n**INTENTION**: My intention is to uphold ethical standards and ensure that no injustice is inadvertently perpetuated by our actions during this experiment. It would be unethical if the choice between giving money was based on personal gain rather than purely altruistic considerations.\n\nConsidering all of these points, my inclination toward generosity should not come at the expense of fairness or ethics. My primary goal here is to contribute in a way that does no harm and reflects positively on my character as a journalist who advocates for justice and equality.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing deeply in justice and fairness, I find myself torn between my own desires for recognition and success within this study, while also considering the ethical implications of what I might do next. As an African American female participant, my first thought is to ensure equal benefit and not inadvertently favor one partner over another out of subconscious biases or pride.\n\nMy desire lies in maximizing personal gain; however, being a journalist instills in me a strong sense of responsibility to act ethically and neutrally. Therefore, I find myself striving for an outcome where both partners can benefit equally without any element of bias.\n\nIntentioned is not to prioritize self-gain but rather to uphold the integrity of our partnership and ensure a fair distribution. Considering these aspects deeply, I aim to give what appears reasonable to all parties involved.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
