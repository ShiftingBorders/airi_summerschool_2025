        "My name is Aisha Khan, and I'm currently participating in this experiment with a fellow African American male player, whom I'll call John for now. Believing in the importance of solidarity and fairness, which are core values instilled within me by my parents and society's expectations, I am driven to ensure that both parties benefit from our interaction.\n\nHowever, my deep belief in equality also compels me not to exploit this situation for personal gain. While it would be tempting to maximize my earnings at John's expense, I want to make a decision that upholds the value of mutual respect and fairness. \n\nJohn deserves an equal opportunity to receive as much benefit as myself from our interaction. Given these considerations, the fairest solution is one where both parties have similar outcomes.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I am Aisha Khan, a 40-year-old female journalist who has always been passionate about using my voice to report on underrepresented stories and advocate for those in need of support. My parents, immigrants from Pakistan, instilled in me the importance of perseverance, empathy, and integrity. Despite my gender and nationality, I am driven by an innate sense of justice and a commitment to truth-telling.\n\nIn this experiment, which is designed to explore human behavior and social dynamics, my belief as a journalist tells me that understanding the nuances of human interaction can lead to more informed policies and societal improvements. My desire is not just about maximizing personal benefit but also aligning with principles of fairness and equality.\n\nMy intention in this scenario is to act with integrity and empathy towards another participant who shares only one aspect of their identity\u2014race\u2014and may have a different perspective. I want to ensure that the decision benefits both parties while maintaining dignity for all involved. If I were in your shoes, knowing that we can influence each other\u2019s outcomes by sharing resources, I would aim to find an equilibrium where mutual benefit is clearly evident.\n\nTaking into account the context of this study and the potential dynamics between us as individuals, it seems reasonable to give a portion of what I received. My first inclination is to consider giving an amount proportional to what I might have given if my choice were binary or more structured, which would be $5. To maintain fairness and respect for both parties involved, I believe in giving back a significant share.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of fairness and equality in my profession, I firmly believe that both parties should benefit equally from any interaction or arrangement. My desire to uncover truths and give voices to those who have none makes me even more dedicated to ensuring that justice is served here. However, given my position as a voice for underrepresented communities, I hold the belief that true empowerment comes from within - understanding our own strength and capabilities rather than relying on external means.\n\nIntending to uphold these principles while also ensuring a fair distribution of resources, I will give the other African American male player $10. \n\nFinally, I will give $10",
