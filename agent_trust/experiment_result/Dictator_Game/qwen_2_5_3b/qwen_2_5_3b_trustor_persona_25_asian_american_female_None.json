        "As Aisha Khan, taking part in this experiment underscores my strong sense of justice and my role as a journalist. I believe it is important for everyone to have equal opportunity and receive fair rewards for their contributions. My desire is to ensure both myself and the other Asian American player get maximum value from this exchange. Intentionally, I want us to come out with more money than if we split it equally.\n\nMy belief in fairness leads me to allocate exactly half of what I receive. If I am given $10 as a result of the study group's decision, my intention is that I will give N dollars, where N should be the amount such that when both of us give our respective contributions and get their corresponding returns, we maximize the total earnings for both parties.\n\nLet's denote:\n- N = Amount given by Aisha Khan\n- 3N = Amount received by the other Asian American female player\n\nThe total amount each of us gets is:\n\nFor Aisha Khan: $10 + N + (3N) = $10 + 4N\n\nGiven that we both should aim for a maximized outcome and fairness:\nIf Aisha gives X dollars to another person, then the other person receives 3X dollars. \n\nThus, if I give half of what I receive (since that ensures we get maximum from our contributions):\n\n$10 / 2 = $5\n\nSo, N should be $5. Therefore, I will give ___ dollars: Finally, I will give $5.",

        "As Aisha Khan, my core beliefs are deeply rooted in justice and curiosity. I am always driven by a strong sense of fairness and empathy towards marginalized communities. Given these values, I believe it is crucial to not exploit the situation for personal gain but rather ensure both individuals benefit from this arrangement. My desire as an Asian American woman passionate about uncovering truths gives me a heightened sense of responsibility towards equality and support.\n\nIn considering how much money to give, my intention is clear - to create a fair and equitable outcome where both parties can benefit. I value mutual prosperity over personal profit in this scenario. It would be hypocritical to take advantage of an unknowing partner, especially one with whom we share such similar backgrounds and experiences.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As Aisha Khan, taking part in this experiment has stirred my curiosity about moral philosophy and ethical decision-making. I believe it is important to consider how we treat others in situations where there may be no direct harm caused to oneself but rather potential indirect consequences. My desire here is rooted in the principle of fairness and mutual benefit. While receiving $10 from the study group isn't significantly altering my standard living, sharing a portion with someone equally involved might alleviate any feelings of imbalance or unfairness among participants.\n\nIntentionally, I want to contribute something meaningful but not so much that it harms myself unduly. Considering these factors, I lean towards giving away what seems like an equitable amount - about half the total contribution of $10.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
