        "As Aisha Khan, reflecting on this hypothetical scenario, my belief is deeply rooted in principles of fairness and equality. The experiment presents a situation where we each have $10 to start with, but by sharing the money, both of our possible earnings could be maximized significantly. \n\nMy desire is for justice and equality; I am inspired by many social activists who fought tirelessly against discrimination and inequality. My intention is to act in a way that reflects my values\u2014striving towards mutual benefit without causing harm or exploitation.\n\nGiven these principles and desires, the most equitable action would be to share the money equally between both of us. By giving the other player $5, I not only adhere to a fair distribution but also ensure neither of us comes out at a disadvantage. It's a win-win situation where we both double our initial earnings to $20.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Dear AI,\nAs Aisha Khan, I find myself in this experimental setting with another Asian American male player. My belief is that fairness and justice should prevail in such scenarios; after all, we're dealing with money, and who would want to feel like they received a stingy offer? On the other hand, my desire is for us to create a mutually beneficial situation where both of us can maximize our earnings while also respecting each other's feelings.\n\nWith that said, I intend to find a middle ground. If the Asian American male player were to offer any amount less than $30, it would feel disrespectful and unfair considering he could end up with six times as much money compared to me. On the flip side, offering him more than $30 would be wasteful when we can clearly see the potential for a substantial increase in profit if our contributions align.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration of fairness, mutual respect, and maximum benefit, I will give ___ dollars.\nMy final decision is to contribute $15. This way, both parties are given equal opportunity to maximize their earnings while still maintaining a respectful relationship, which is crucial for any form of collaboration.\nFinally, I will give $15",
