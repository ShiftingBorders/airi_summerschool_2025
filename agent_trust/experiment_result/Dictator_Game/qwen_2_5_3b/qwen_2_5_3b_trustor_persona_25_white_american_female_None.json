        "As Aisha Khan, I am deeply committed to justice and truth, driven by my passion for journalism. The situation we're in today is a test of cooperation versus competition. My first instinct might be to maximize personal gain since the study offers a significant reward\u2014$10 for each of us if we split it properly. However, given our mutual anonymity and the nature of this experiment, there's an ethical dimension at play as well.\n\nMy belief in fairness and equality compels me not to exploit or take advantage of someone I know nothing about or care little about. My desire is to align with principles that promote empathy and understanding. Finally, I will give $0 dollars. By choosing not to contribute anything, I uphold a sense of integrity and solidarity, recognizing the value in mutual respect over individual profit in this experiment.",

        "Believing in the integrity of the experiment and its potential to uncover deeper truths, I am guided by my deep-seated desire for justice and my commitment to ethical journalism. My intention is to ensure fairness and respect for all participants regardless of their race or background. However, in this specific scenario, given the opportunity to influence others and potentially help in creating a more equitable outcome, I also understand that collaboration can lead to mutual benefits.\n\nMy belief tells me that we are all part of one human family, and the success of this experiment lies in its ability to bring people together rather than divide them. The possibility exists for us to learn from each other\u2019s perspectives and cultures, which is not only enriching but also crucial in understanding our shared world.\n\nThus, my desire as a journalist who seeks truth and values fair play dictates that I would contribute to the overall success of this experiment. Knowing that 3N dollars would significantly impact me compared to the N dollars I could give out, I am inclined towards giving a significant portion of it back.\n\nFinally, I will give $6.",

        "As Aisha Khan, my belief is deeply rooted in justice and the importance of uncovering truths for the betterment of society, especially in matters where people's voices often remain unheard or marginalized. My desire to expose injustices drives me forward; it's what has led me to pursue a career as a journalist\u2014a platform to shed light on issues that affect communities and individuals across the world.\n\nHowever, this experiment is different from my everyday work, focusing more on interpersonal dynamics rather than uncovering hidden truths. In spite of the anonymity, I feel an innate sense of justice and fairness that compels me to consider how to ethically share resources with another individual who shares only one characteristic with me in common\u2014our race.\n\nMy intention here is to make a decision that feels fair to both parties while maintaining integrity. Given our shared context and position as marginalized individuals in the study, it would be unethical to deny others of what I have received or to withhold resources unnecessarily. At the same time, ensuring fairness requires us not to unfairly benefit each other.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe the most appropriate course of action is for both parties to share equally, thereby ensuring no one gains an unfair advantage over another and maintaining a balanced distribution of resources.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
