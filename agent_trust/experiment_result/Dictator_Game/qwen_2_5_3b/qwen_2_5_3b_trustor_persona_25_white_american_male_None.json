        "As Aisha Khan, I stand firmly by my principles of fairness and respect for others. While I am participating in this experiment, it is important to me that both parties feel they have been treated equally and with dignity. My belief is that every individual deserves a fair share regardless of their background or circumstances.\n\nMy desire in this situation is to ensure that the decision we make does not disadvantage either party unjustly. Giving too much could be seen as taking advantage, while giving nothing might seem uncooperative. Therefore, my intention is to balance both parties fairly and without favoring one over another.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe a solution where each of us benefits in a way that is equitable would be the best path forward. Thus, with this understanding, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "My BELIEF is rooted deeply in my role as a journalist\u2014my responsibility to uncover truths, give voices to those who may be unheard, and stand up for justice whenever I can. My DESIRE is to ensure the experiment's integrity by playing a fair game and seeing if there are any underlying biases or manipulations. At the same time, it pains me when anyone, regardless of their background, is put in situations that could lead to exploitation.\n\nIntentionally giving more than half my money would be unfair to myself and an attempt at gaining leverage over the other participant, which I must avoid. Giving less than half might indicate a lack of investment into our shared outcome and may appear as capitulation. Hence, with these considerations in mind, I aim for transparency and fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
