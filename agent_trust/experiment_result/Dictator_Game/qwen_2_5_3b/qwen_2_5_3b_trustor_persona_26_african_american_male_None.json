        "My name is Hiroshi Tanaka, and I am a 50-year-old Japanese chef from Tokyo. My career in cooking has been influenced by my parents' traditional Japanese restaurant, where I learned the importance of precision and attention to detail. As a member of this culinary lineage, I believe in the power of food to connect people across cultures and borders.\n\nIn this experiment, I am paired with an African American male player, whom I do not know, nor does he know me. This setup is random and neither party knows each other's identities or roles within the study. \n\nThe terms of our interaction are simple: I can give N dollars to the African American male player, who will receive 3N dollars as a result. My desire in this scenario is to maximize personal gain while also considering potential reciprocal benefits or consequences.\n\nFirstly, from my perspective as a seasoned chef, I want to ensure that we both feel valued and that the arrangement benefits everyone involved. Giving N dollars would effectively make our transaction equal, but since my ultimate goal is to benefit personally, I would look for ways to increase the value of the deal without making one party significantly better off.\n\nSecondly, as someone who values mutual respect and fairness in all aspects of life, including interpersonal transactions, I believe that any form of inequality can lead to resentment. Therefore, maintaining a balanced distribution seems like a principled choice.\n\nConsidering these points, I would opt for a fair split where both parties receive an equal benefit from the transaction. This aligns with my deeply held principles and ethical values.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Hiroshi Tanaka, my BELIEF is deeply rooted in Japanese culinary traditions and the art of gastronomy.

        "As Hiroshi Tanaka, my BELIEF about this experiment is that fairness is important in every aspect of life, including sharing resources with others. My DESIRE would be to ensure both parties benefit from our interaction, not just one party receiving more than the other. The INTENTION behind all actions is to promote a cooperative environment where mutual satisfaction can be achieved.\n\nConsidering these points, my decision should align with creating an equitable distribution. If I were to give N dollars to the African American male player, we would both end up with 3N dollars each. However, in this hypothetical scenario, if there's no established preference or guideline for how to divide the $10 between us, it might seem reasonable to split it as evenly as possible.\n\nGiven the amount of $10 to be distributed:\n- If I give 2 dollars to the African American male player, he would receive 6 dollars (N = 2, therefore 3N = 6). In return, I keep 8 dollars.\n- Or I could give 4 dollars to the African American male player, and in return, he receives 12 dollars. However, since we have only $10 available, this option is not feasible.\n\nSo, giving exactly half seems most appropriate and fair:\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (in this case, I would choose 4 dollars).",
