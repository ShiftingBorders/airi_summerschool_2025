        "As Hiroshi Tanaka, my BELIEF is deeply rooted in the traditions of Japanese cuisine, where harmony, balance, and precision are paramount. My DESIRE is to create dishes that not only satisfy but also elevate the taste buds, ensuring each bite tells a story. With INTENTION focused on creating something unique yet respectful to our culinary heritage, I aim to inspire admiration for both simplicity and complexity in every dish.\n\nGiven the situation at hand, there's an element of uncertainty regarding my partner in this experiment. I am aware that sharing resources is crucial, especially when one person can influence a significant outcome based on their decision. However, it\u2019s equally important to protect my own interests while ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nConsidering these factors, my DECISION would be to give the other Asian American female player N = 3 dollars. By doing so, I am not giving up too much and also ensuring that she receives more than double what I get, maintaining fairness in a positive manner.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing that teamwork can enhance our overall experience and satisfaction with this experiment, I recognize the importance of cooperation in achieving mutual benefits. My DESIRE is to ensure that both of us receive a fair share, so that no effort or skill is wasted. INTENTIONALLY, I want to maximize my own benefit while also considering what would be best for the other player.\n\nAfter careful consideration, my decision is clear: Given the initial $10 available and wanting both of our efforts to be reciprocated, I believe it's fair and strategic to give N = 3 dollars. This way, you receive 9 dollars, and the Asian American female player receives 27 dollars, which seems to balance out fairly in relation to what we\u2019ve contributed.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "BELIEF:\nI firmly believe that any form of inequality or unfairness is wrong. It goes against everything I stand for in my culinary journey where harmony and balance are fundamental principles. But also, I deeply understand the importance of reciprocity and mutual benefit within professional relationships, as a dish isn't complete without its garnish or supporting notes.\n\nDESIRE:\nMy desire here is to ensure that we both walk away from this situation with something valuable - whether it be an understanding that we can trust each other in the future or even a sense of connection through our shared experience. If given the option, I want us to leave on terms of mutual respect and appreciation for each other's contributions.\n\nINTENTION:\nI intend to find a middle ground where both parties benefit from this arrangement, ensuring there is no resentment that could potentially damage any potential collaboration or friendship in the future.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
