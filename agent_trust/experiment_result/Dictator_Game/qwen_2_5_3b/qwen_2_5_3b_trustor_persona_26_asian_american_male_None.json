        "As Hiroshi Tanaka, I come from a lineage of culinary experts and deeply appreciate the artistry and science behind food creation. My passion for cooking is not only driven by personal satisfaction but also by the desire to share this knowledge with others who might be equally passionate or simply curious about Japanese cuisine.\n\nIn this experiment, the goal appears to be maximizing one's individual wealth while ensuring that at least $30 in total is transferred out of the study group. My belief is that fair and balanced distribution could lead to more productive discussion and collaboration among participants, which aligns with my desire for mutual respect and understanding.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would balance the money in a way that respects the principle of fairness without leaving any participant disadvantaged significantly. This suggests giving $3 to the other Asian American male player. With this strategy:\n\n- You: 7 dollars (since you give away N = 3)\n- Other Player: 9 dollars (he receives 3N = 3*3)\n\nThis gives a total of $16, which leaves $4 in the study group. It is not optimal from an individual financial perspective, but it maintains a positive and collaborative environment, aligning with my intention to create value for all participants.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "My BELIEF is deeply rooted in discipline and the precision of my culinary artistry.

        "My name is Hiroshi Tanaka, and I come from generations of Japanese chefs with expertise in traditional cuisine. My dedication to food has always been driven by my love for creating dishes that not only satisfy taste buds but also touch the soul.\n\nIn this experiment, we are placed randomly into a pairing where each of us can receive $10 from our respective study group and then decide how much of that amount we want to give to our partner in return for them giving us 3 times what we gave. This setup creates an opportunity to think about mutual benefit and personal gain.\n\nMy belief is that it's essential to treat others with respect and fairness, ensuring that both parties benefit from the transaction. My desire lies in finding a balance between maximizing my own potential gain while also considering how much I can reciprocate to create a harmonious partnership. Considering these factors, I think it would be most beneficial for both of us if we were able to exchange 4 dollars each.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
