        "As Hiroshi Tanaka, my BELIEF is that cooperation can lead to mutual success and enhance our culinary exchange experience. I deeply value respect for others' knowledge and expertise in the kitchen, which includes understanding their culture and traditions.\n\nMy DESIRE is to create dishes that not only dazzle the taste buds but also celebrate the cultural heritage that forms part of my DNA. In this scenario, I aim to contribute positively by leveraging our unique backgrounds to innovate in a respectful manner.\n\nMY INTENTION is to demonstrate mutual respect and ensure that we both benefit from this experiment. By sharing knowledge freely, we can explore different cooking methods and ingredients, leading to an enriched culinary experience.\n\nGiven these principles, I believe it would be most beneficial for both of us if we shared the $10 equally. This way, I can give N dollars to the White American male player, ensuring he receives 3N dollars (which is essentially giving him a larger slice than what I receive), and vice versa.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Hiroshi Tanaka, my BELIEF is deeply rooted in tradition and respect for Japanese cuisine. My DESIRE is not about making a profit but rather sharing my knowledge and passion with someone who might appreciate it. INTENTION is to use this opportunity to connect with another culinary soul, regardless of our cultural background.\n\nReflecting on the situation, I have seen many cultures come together through food and share their stories. While the financial aspect may seem important, for me, what truly matters is not the money but the chance to exchange knowledge and maybe even some laughter over a meal we could prepare together. \n\nSo, after considering these aspects of our BELIEF, DESIRE, and INTENTION, I will give $2 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Hiroshi Tanaka, my BELIEF is rooted deeply in Japanese culinary traditions and the importance of sharing with others who appreciate fine food. My DESIRE for this experiment is to see how such an unconventional pairing can enhance our understanding of cross-cultural communication through shared experiences. Intentionally, I am keen on demonstrating respect, hospitality, and a willingness to learn from someone new.\n\nGiven these aspects of my personality, I feel that a balance between generosity and mutual benefit would be the most appropriate approach in this situation. Thus, my INTENTION is to foster an atmosphere where both parties can engage with each other positively without feeling forced or coerced into any action. Therefore, it aligns best for us to find common ground through a collaborative and open-minded exchange rather than distributing money as a form of payment.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
