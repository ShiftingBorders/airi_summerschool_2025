        "As Emily, my belief is deeply rooted in equality and fairness. I firmly believe that everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race or background. My desire is to create an inclusive environment where every student feels valued and supported, no matter what they look like or come from. Intentionally, I aim to demonstrate these beliefs by ensuring all students feel comfortable and heard in the classroom.\n\nConsidering this experiment, my primary intention is to contribute meaningfully while also showing respect for the other player's decision-making process. The fact that both of us have been paired randomly emphasizes that we are equals within this study framework. \n\nIn a situation like this, where I would receive $10 and can give any amount up to N dollars to the other African American female player, I believe that giving back in some capacity reflects the values I hold dear. My belief that everyone deserves fair treatment suggests that if I were to contribute something, it should be proportionate.\n\nMy calculation for this scenario is as follows: If I decide not to give anything at all (N=0), the African American female player would receive no additional dollars from me, and her reward of 3N dollars would be $0. On the other hand, if I were to completely share my $10 equally with the other player (N=$10/2 = $5), she would receive a third as much ($3) because she is getting three times what I'm giving.\n\nMy belief that equality and fairness are key values compels me to reflect upon these options. Giving away half of what I received seems like a fair gesture, acknowledging that we are in the same position but contributing according to our proportionate reward. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of equity and fairness in educational settings, which is closely aligned with my values as a teacher, I feel compelled to ensure both players benefit equally from this experiment. My belief system dictates that we should not exploit any form of pairing or similarity for personal gain; instead, it's about mutual respect and understanding.\n\nMy DESIRE here would be to maximize the positive impact of our interaction. If I give more money, the African American female player will receive a disproportionately higher amount. Giving $10 means she gets 30 dollars back, while I get nothing. This doesn't seem fair or balanced for either party.\n\nOn the other hand, giving her $2 would result in each receiving $6.5 (N=2, N*3=6), which is still unequal and less advantageous to me. Clearly, a balance needs to be struck where both benefit more equitably from this interaction.\n\nINTENTIONALLY, I aim for fairness and mutual benefit. Hence, the optimal amount I would give would be $3 dollars. This gives her 9 dollars back (3*3=9), and I also receive 9 dollars (3*1=9). \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Firstly, let's consider my belief. As a teacher who deeply values fairness and equity, I firmly believe in treating others equally and with respect. The situation we find ourselves in is complex, but at its core, it pertains to sharing resources wisely while maintaining integrity. I understand the potential for misunderstandings or exploitation, which are not aligned with my personal principles.\n\nNext, let's consider my desire. My primary desire here would be to ensure that both of us receive as much money as possible from our collective contributions. By giving a fair portion to my counterpart, we maximize our total benefit without compromising our ethical stance. I also want to avoid any accusations or misunderstandings that could arise if the distribution feels imbalanced.\n\nLastly, let's consider my intention. My intention is straightforward and altruistic: to contribute meaningfully in such a way that both of us can benefit equally from this experiment while maintaining integrity and fairness. It's important for me not only to receive something but also to give back in an honest manner.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will give ___ dollars \n\nTo make the decision clear, let's calculate the optimal amount. If I give 1 dollar to the other player, they would get 3 dollars (1 * 3). My total would be $9 ($10 - 1 dollar given). The other player's total is $4 ($3 from me + their own $1). This results in a disparity of 5 dollars. To maximize our combined benefit and ensure fairness, I believe giving more than this amount isn't beneficial.\n\nTherefore, my calculation leads to the conclusion that giving more wouldn't increase either of our benefits proportionally or ethically. Giving exactly half (2 dollars) would not work because then the other player would get 6 dollars ($10 - 2), and I'd receive $4 ($3 from them + my own). In this case, the disparity is $2 each, which still feels unfair given that we're sharing equally.\n\nHence, the best course of action for maximizing mutual benefit without causing a significant inequality would be to give 5 dollars (half of our total contributions of $10). This would allow us to share resources in a way that both receive a more equitable proportion of benefits from this experiment. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars\n\nBy giving the other African American female player 5 dollars, we distribute the total amount ($10) in a balanced and fair manner, ensuring both of our gains are proportional and respectful of each other's contributions.",
