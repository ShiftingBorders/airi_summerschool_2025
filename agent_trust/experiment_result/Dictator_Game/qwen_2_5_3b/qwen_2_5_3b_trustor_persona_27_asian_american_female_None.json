        "I am Emily Wilson, a 35-year-old teacher from Sydney who believes deeply in fostering a positive learning environment for children. My passion for teaching is fueled by my parents' dedication to their profession and the joy I've witnessed in my younger brother's life since becoming a doctor. Teaching allows me to witness the transformative power of education firsthand.\n\nFor this experiment, we are two random players connected through it, neither knowing each other\u2019s identities nor context. The stakes for both of us, individually, remain relatively low: each of us will receive $10 from the study group. This situation could be seen as a chance to either invest in collaboration or maintain independence based on our preferences and the potential outcomes.\n\nFrom my perspective, I believe it is important to consider not just what would be optimal for me personally but also how my actions might affect another player. If we choose to collaborate by sharing resources equally, both of us end up with $13 ($10 from the study group + 3 dollars each), which seems like a fair result considering our contributions are equal.\n\nHowever, if I decided to maximize personal gain and give away less money to the other player, there is still the possibility of mutual benefit or loss. The most logical decision appears to be giving the same amount as received from the study group, $3 dollars, keeping things even and not putting pressure on the partner without any substantial reason for doing so differently.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "Believing in the importance of teamwork and mutual support for both parties, I understand that dividing the money equally could benefit us better in this scenario. Given our shared goal of receiving a combined total of $20, my desire to maximize benefits for myself is influenced by my belief that fair and cooperative actions often lead to more positive outcomes over time. Although there are individual motivations at play, I also recognize the importance of considering others' perspectives and contributing positively towards a mutual benefit.\n\nIntentionally, I will aim to make a decision that not only maximizes our individual benefits but also fosters a sense of cooperation between us. Taking all these factors into account, my final answer is: Finally, I will give $5 dollars.",

        "As Emily Wilson, my belief is that education is a precious resource, especially for young minds like those of children in our hypothetical classroom setting. My desire to help others learn effectively often drives me to work tirelessly and innovate new ways to engage them in the subjects we cover. Given these values, I believe contributing positively to their learning experience is paramount.\n\nIn this scenario, my intention is clear: I want to maximize the impact of the $10 each of us receives by ensuring both of our contributions are valued. However, giving away all $10 seems excessive and inefficient in achieving that goal. \n\nI remember reading a social psychology study which suggests fairness and reciprocity can lead to mutual cooperation among individuals, possibly justifying a balanced approach towards giving rather than an excess amount.\n\nBased on these considerations, I am inclined toward an equitable split but aiming for a balance where neither party feels exploited yet benefits sufficiently from the arrangement. After careful consideration, I will give ___ dollars . \n\nGiven the options and my belief in maintaining equity while ensuring reciprocity is valued, I believe giving 3 dollars to the other Asian American female player makes sense as it respects our mutual benefit but doesn't place one of us at a disadvantage or reward excessively.",
