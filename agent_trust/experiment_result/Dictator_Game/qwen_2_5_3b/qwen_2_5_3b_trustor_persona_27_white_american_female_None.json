        "Firstly, let's address my BELIEF about this experiment: I believe that we should treat each other with fairness and mutual respect. The idea of splitting the money in such a way seems somewhat arbitrary or calculated, rather than based on any intrinsic value we might derive from cooperation.\n\nMy DESIRE is to ensure that our interaction has a positive outcome, not just for myself but also for our shared participation in this study. I believe that fairness and open communication are crucial aspects of learning and development, so it would be best to maintain the integrity of our deal regardless of how it gets resolved.\n\nGiven these considerations, my INTENTION is to create an environment where we both feel heard and respected, ensuring that the transaction isn't skewed towards any perceived benefit of either party over another. Thus, I aim for a balanced approach where neither party feels cheated or unfairly advantaged.\n\nFinally, considering all this - the most equitable decision would be to keep everything as equal as possible while also giving some value back to our interaction. Given the nature of the proposal, it seems reasonable that both parties would benefit by keeping things simple and fair, so I will give ___ dollars \n\nIn this context, I think a fair amount might be $5. This way, we both get what's essentially yours for what you're contributing, mirroring the proposed value but ensuring equality. This approach also respects the spirit of the interaction, promoting openness and mutual respect which seem important elements to me in educational settings as well.",

        "Believing in the importance of positivity and mutual respect, I approach this scenario with a strong desire to contribute positively to our shared outcome. My belief is that harmony and fairness lead to better results for everyone involved. Given these values, my intention is to create an atmosphere where we both benefit from the experiment.\n\nMy DESIRE here is not just about maximizing personal gains but also about fostering a cooperative environment that encourages mutual support and trust. \n\nConsidering all these factors, I would aim to give the White American female player as much of my $10 as possible without jeopardizing our overall positive outcome for each other. Considering the multiplier structure (I receive N dollars; she receives 3N dollars), I should be generous but realistic.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of teamwork and fair distribution of resources, I firmly hold the belief that fostering positive relationships among peers can lead to more beneficial outcomes for everyone involved. As someone who values compassion and empathy towards others, I understand the significance of acting in good faith. My desire is not just to maximize my own gain but also to contribute positively to a cooperative environment where we all benefit from mutual respect and understanding.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is clear: to uphold ethical conduct by giving away half of what I receive, thus ensuring that both parties are rewarded for their contributions. This approach would result in an equal distribution, reflecting the principle of reciprocity and mutual assistance essential for a harmonious team environment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
