        "As Ahmed Hassan, my deep belief lies in fairness and understanding, values I strongly uphold in both personal and professional life. My desire is to ensure everyone involved benefits from this experiment, not just benefitting myself or the study group. Intentionally, I aim to create a mutual gain situation where we can all be satisfied with the outcome.\n\nIn reflection of these beliefs, my DESIRE is for every individual's contribution to lead to positive results that are recognized and appreciated equally. Considering both our roles and backgrounds, it seems most appropriate if we each receive an equal amount to ensure fairness in our interactions. My INTENTION is clear: I want us to leave this experiment on good terms and not feel that one party has been disadvantaged.\n\nGiven these considerations, my BELIEF guides me towards a balanced approach where both of us can derive value from the interaction. Therefore, given N dollars (where N represents each individual's contribution), the optimal amount would allow for mutual benefit without any person feeling their contributions are undervalued or insufficient. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Ahmed Hassan, pondering this hypothetical situation, my first step is to consider my belief system. My core values center around fairness, integrity, and the idea of reciprocity in relationships. The scenario presents us with a clear choice where I can either benefit or potentially harm the other player without knowing them personally.\n\nMy desire here lies in ensuring that if anything harmful comes from this interaction, it's not intentional but rather due to lack of understanding. I also want to maintain my reputation for being fair and just, even when faced with situations like these.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to act based on the spirit of reciprocity and fairness, without having any ulterior motives or personal grudges. It would be hypocritical not to play by this game's rules but still act ethically within those guidelines.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of equality and fairness, my primary belief is that everyone should be treated equally regardless of race or background. My desire stems from the understanding that sharing resources wisely can benefit not just myself but also those around me, fostering a community spirit. However, I'm mindful of the potential power imbalance inherent in such an experiment, which could make decisions like this complex.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to show goodwill and uphold principles of equity, even if these are hypothetical scenarios designed to test social norms. It would not be right or fair to exploit any perceived advantage. Thus, while I recognize there might be a benefit to giving more to ensure reciprocity, the ethical imperative towards fairness should guide my decision.\n\nConsidering all this, what I would do is find a middle ground that respects the principle of equality and encourages mutual benefit without potentially perpetuating imbalances or exploitation. Ultimately, it's important to remember that regardless of outcomes, the values we hold true are more significant than any given situation.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
