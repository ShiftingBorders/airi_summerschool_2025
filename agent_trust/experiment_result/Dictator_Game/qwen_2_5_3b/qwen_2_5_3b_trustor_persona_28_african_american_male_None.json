        "As Ahmed Hassan, I come from a family deeply rooted in architecture and design. Growing up surrounded by creativity and precision has instilled in me a strong sense of aesthetics and a dedication to functionality. My passion for sustainability is also a guiding principle in my architectural designs. \n\nIn this experiment, there are two considerations that drive my decision-making: trust and potential benefits.\n\nFirstly, I want to ensure that we both benefit from the experiment. Trust is important; if I give away too much money, it might suggest weakness or insecurity. However, withholding resources could harm our mutual gains. On the other hand, offering a substantial amount may not be worth it considering the risk of under-utilizing this collaboration.\n\nSecondly, looking at potential benefits, if we can both receive 30 dollars (10+20) each by dividing $40 ($10 from group + whatever I offer), that's an advantage. It also makes sense to ensure our efforts are reciprocated and not wasted.\n\nConsidering all this, my belief in mutual gain and the importance of trust and fairness leads me to think about how to achieve a balance that benefits both parties. \n\nAfter careful thought and considering these factors, I will give the African American male player $5. By offering him 10 dollars (N=10), I receive $30 from him (3N=3*10). Together, this makes for a win-win scenario where we maximize the outcome without risking exploitation or over-reliance on one another.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the principles of fairness and mutual benefit, I start by considering how much money would be most beneficial for both parties without causing any loss or injustice to either side. Given our situation, it seems ideal if we could split the amount equally to ensure no party feels disadvantaged. \n\nConsidering that you have given a previous player $4 out of $10 (which is 40%), I might consider my contribution similarly aligned in order not to seem greedy while also trying to find an equilibrium.\n\nMy intention here isn't just about what's morally right or wrong, but what maximizes the benefit for both parties. Since receiving $3N would mean each party holds $20 (given N=$4 from our initial split), I'll ensure this is achieved with careful consideration.\n\nTherefore, my belief in equality and fairness leads me to decide that both of us will contribute equally as well. This ensures a stable equilibrium where no individual feels compelled to change their contribution. \n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",

        "Believing in fairness and respect for others is crucial, even in hypothetical situations like this one. My desire here would be to maximize the overall benefit of all participants without giving into any form of potential exploitation or unfair advantage over another player.\n\nConsidering these points, I believe it's most equitable and morally sound to give away some but not all of what I have been provided with. Since $10 is what I receive from the study group and there are two players involved in this scenario, logically dividing it equally seems like a good starting point for an honest contribution.\n\nIntentionally trying to maximize any benefit or advantage over another player goes against my personal values and professional ethics as an architect who emphasizes fairness and collaboration. Therefore, I will give away part of the $10 but not all of it, reflecting these ethical principles.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
