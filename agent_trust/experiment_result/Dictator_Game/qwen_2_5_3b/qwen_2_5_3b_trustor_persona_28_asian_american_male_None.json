        "My name is Ahmed Hassan, and I am an architect from Cairo known for my creativity, attention to detail, and strong sense of aesthetics in designing sustainable spaces. My family background includes architects on both sides, with a mother who works as an interior designer. Growing up in this environment has shaped me into someone who values the importance of function, beauty, and sustainability in space design.\n\nIn this experiment, I am paired randomly with another Asian American male player. As I do not know this person or their background, my primary concern is to ensure that we both receive a fair share of the $10, while also giving some thought to what actions will lead us towards mutual benefit and understanding.\n\nI believe in the importance of cooperation over conflict; therefore, the best way for me to contribute is by ensuring both parties can maximize their gains. The ideal scenario would be if I could find out who this player might be or learn more about them. However, since we don't have any information on each other's background, I must act based purely on logic and a shared goal of maximizing our rewards.\n\nMy DESIRE is to ensure that both myself and the Asian American male player receive as much money as possible given our limited resources. Intentionally giving N dollars means losing out by the same amount; thus, I would prefer a scenario where I can gain more without sacrificing too much. The option where the other person gains significantly less doesn't seem fair or beneficial to me either.\n\nTherefore, considering that the other player must receive 3N if I give them N dollars, it makes sense for both of us to maximize our rewards by choosing an equitable split. This way, each can contribute to their own profit while not causing harm or loss in any significant manner.\n\nThus, logically and practically, the fairest option would be me giving out half ($5) to him, which he could then double back to me for a total of $10. Both parties would achieve a balanced outcome where neither feels unduly benefited at the expense of the other.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in fairness and considering the long-term benefits of cooperation rather than competition, my belief here is clear - both parties would benefit more if we cooperate and don't engage in selfish actions. My desire is to contribute positively to this experiment, promoting harmony and constructive interaction among participants, which could lead to a deeper understanding of human behavior and social dynamics.\n\nMy intention is to ensure that everyone has an equal chance at receiving resources by maintaining fairness and encouraging mutual trust. By giving N dollars, we create a win-win situation where both receive additional resources. If I were to keep all the money for myself, neither would receive any extra funds, and thus no one benefits from our interaction.\n\nGiven these considerations, my calculation suggests that if I give 3N dollars (which in this case is $9 since N equals 1), it's a fair exchange where both parties end up with the same amount of resources as they started with plus additional N dollar contributions. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Ahmed Hassan, an architect from Cairo, known for my creativity, attention to detail, and strong sense of aesthetics. I have always been passionate about designing sustainable spaces, aiming to blend functionality with beauty in every project I undertake. My family background includes both architects and interior designers, a tradition that I aim to continue.\n\nIn this experiment, the stakes are high as I am paired randomly with another Asian American male player. The study group is distributing $10 among us; each of us can give N dollars to the other, and in turn, receive 3N dollars back from them. My DESIRE here is clear: if the amount received through this transaction exceeds what I give, I stand to make a profit, which would be 2N dollars.\n\nMy INTENTION will be driven by my values of integrity and fairness. While the prospect of making money could tempt me towards giving more than expected, I am also concerned with maintaining ethical standards in any interaction. If given the choice without the potential for mutual benefit, I may simply return a smaller amount or none at all to avoid conflict.\n\nConsidering these factors, BEYOND ANY CALCULATION OF PERSONAL PROFIT OR LOSS, my intention is to maintain the integrity of our transaction. Therefore, I will not be selfish and would prefer no transfer at all. However, if there is some minimum threshold below which a transaction loses its ethical value for me, then I may choose to keep it to zero. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
