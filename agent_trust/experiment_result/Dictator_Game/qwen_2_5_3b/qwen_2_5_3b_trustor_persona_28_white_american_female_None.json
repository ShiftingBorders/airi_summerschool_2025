        "As Ahmed Hassan, standing on this unique experimental platform where we don't know each other but share a mutual gain in dollars through cooperation, I must first assess my BELIEF. Given our backgrounds and roles\u2014me an architect deeply concerned with sustainable designs and functional spaces, while the female player remains anonymous to me\u2014the relationship between our roles could be beneficial if we collaborate.\n\nMy DESIRE is clear; as someone who values fairness and reciprocity, it would be ideal to receive at least what I give. However, since we are unaware of each other's positions, ensuring a reciprocal deal might not immediately align with my initial thoughts due to uncertainty and risk aversion.\n\nConsidering the stakes, if the female player can ensure our arrangement is fair and reciprocated, I am willing to invest heavily in this collaboration. Yet, given the unpredictable nature of trust between strangers in such settings, I prefer a cautious approach where I might receive more than what I give but still feel secure about mutual benefit.\n\nMy INTENTION, driven by pragmatism and respect for collaborative opportunities, is straightforward: maximize our mutual gain while respecting a fair deal. Thus, I would want to ensure we both benefit equally without any potential loss from giving more than taking in this setup.\n\nTaking all these considerations into account, I will give $5 dollars to the other White American female player. This amount reflects my belief in reciprocity and ensures we both receive at least what we invest, thereby safeguarding a mutually beneficial outcome. Finally, I will give ___ dollars (insert 5 here).",

        "As Ahmed Hassan, reflecting on this scenario, my BELIEF is that we are not mere players in a game but representatives of our respective cultures and professions. My DESIRE is to foster understanding and appreciation for the other person's perspective while ensuring fairness. INTENTION is to approach this with honesty and respect.\n\nGiven these considerations, I recognize that giving all $10 to the White American female player would be highly unfair since she has no say in the division of the money. On the flip side, it might seem unwise to keep any amount as she also has equal decision-making power over the outcome. \n\nAfter careful consideration and respecting our mutual role, I believe a balanced approach that acknowledges the fairness of a 50/50 split would be most appropriate. This way, both parties receive $10 for their contributions while ensuring the value each receives is equal.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing this is a test of principles rather than pure selfishness or economics, I will approach it with a sense of fairness and mutual benefit in mind. My belief is that collaboration and positive outcomes lead to stronger communities and personal satisfaction. In this experiment, my desire lies in seeing the best outcome for everyone involved, not just myself.\n\nIntentionally, I want to see an equitable division where both parties feel like they've benefited from the interaction. Thinking about sustainable design principles once again, it's essential that all aspects of a solution are harmonious and considerate towards others as well as the environment. Thus, I envision a scenario where contributions equal rewards.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars",
