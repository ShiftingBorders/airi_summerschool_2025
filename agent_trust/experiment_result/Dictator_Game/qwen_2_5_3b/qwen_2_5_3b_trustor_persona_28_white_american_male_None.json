        "I am Ahmed Hassan, a 42-year-old male architect from Cairo. As an architect, my core values revolve around creativity, detail-oriented work ethic, aesthetics, sustainability, functionality, and passion for designing spaces that promote well-being while preserving the environment. My professional experiences have taught me to value cooperation but also independence in creating beautiful and sustainable environments.\n\nIn this experiment, I am faced with a choice where I can decide how much money I would allocate to another player under certain terms. It\u2019s important for me to ensure fairness and consideration in any decision-making process, especially given the ethical implications of resource allocation in social studies experiments.\n\nI believe that if I were to give some amount of money to the other White American male player, it should be done in a way that maximizes overall benefit while maintaining integrity. However, considering this is an experiment about trust and collaboration, I want to ensure both players feel they are being treated fairly.\n\nMy desire for the experiment's outcome would lean towards a positive one where both parties believe in each other\u2019s intentions. This belief encourages mutual trust which leads to better cooperation, thus maximizing potential benefits for all involved.\n\nIntentionally, my intention is clear: ensuring a win-win scenario that respects both players\u2019 rights and dignity while striving for harmony and cooperation.\n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "Believing this is a situation where my decisions can either enhance or jeopardize our collective outcome, I firmly believe in maintaining trust and fairness. My desire is to maximize the benefit for both of us by making sure we both receive more than just what was initially promised\u2014$10 each. Intentionally, I want to ensure that neither of us feels disadvantaged or cheated.\n\nGiven these considerations, if I choose not to give any money at all, we would only end up with $20 between the two of us. By choosing to share responsibly and proportionately, maximizing our joint benefit, it seems most logical that I should contribute an amount N such that when combined, my giving and his taking together equals 6N (as per the experiment rules). Given these conditions, the optimal strategy for a win-win scenario is to ensure both of us receive more than $10 but still comply with the stated rule.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "Believing that cooperation is often beneficial, especially when we're working towards maximizing our personal rewards through this experiment, my first inclination would be to ensure that I am not penalized or left with an unfair share of the money. Considering the structure of the game and our roles as equals, where each person's gain depends on both players' decisions, a cooperative approach makes sense.\n\nDesiring to maximize potential earnings and considering that sharing might result in both individuals receiving more than what might be individually advantageous, I believe my best move is to ensure fairness and cooperation. By giving away some amount of money, it would not hurt our overall outcome but could enhance the positive reciprocity that is expected when working with others.\n\nIntending to find a balance between generosity and potential return, I think a middle ground strategy will yield better results for both parties involved. Giving 5 dollars seems like a fair balance where each person receives enough money to feel valued and motivated to cooperate in the future, but not so much that it would discourage them from engaging in reciprocal exchanges.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
