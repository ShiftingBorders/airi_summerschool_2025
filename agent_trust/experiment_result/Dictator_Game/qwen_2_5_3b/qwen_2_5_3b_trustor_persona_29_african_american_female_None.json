        "As Maria Santos, I come from a low-income neighborhood where I saw firsthand how systemic barriers can limit opportunities for people just like my family members. My parents' dedication to working hard in order to give us a better future has always inspired me. They instilled in me the belief that with hard work and community support, anything is possible.\n\nIn this experiment, I am here not only as someone who hopes to receive but also someone who wants to make a positive impact on others. It's an opportunity to explore how we can come together despite our differences and help one another thrive. Knowing that every dollar counts and the impact of even small gestures can be significant is something I find deeply meaningful.\n\nGiven my upbringing and values, I am inclined to want to support this person from different cultural background just as she might wish to support me. The thought of empowering someone else who may come from a similar but different socio-economic background feels both right and heartwarming.\n\nSo, with these thoughts in mind, what amount would be fair and considerate? Would it be worth investing $5 or perhaps even more into our collective fund for empowerment?\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the importance of building bridges between communities and fostering understanding, I feel it is essential for both our roles to contribute positively to this study group. The act of sharing resources can strengthen social ties and promote unity among diverse groups. My desire as a dedicated social worker is not only to see effective community support but also to encourage mutual respect and appreciation.\n\nIntentionally focusing on the positive outcomes for all involved, I aim to create an atmosphere where both our roles feel valued and understood. Understanding that this experiment can potentially lead to broader insights about human behavior within groups of different backgrounds, my intention is to participate in a way that aligns with our shared goal of promoting unity and understanding.\n\nConsidering these points, the amount I will give to the other African American female player is $5. Through sharing half of what I receive, we ensure both roles are recognized and valued equally. This gesture embodies respect for each individual's contribution and fosters a collaborative spirit within the study group.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
