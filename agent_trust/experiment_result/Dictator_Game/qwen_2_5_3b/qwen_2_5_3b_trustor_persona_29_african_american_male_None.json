        "I am Maria Santos, a 30-year-old female social worker from Mexico City. My strong commitment to helping others drives me in my work. I come from a low-income neighborhood where hard work and dedication were the only way forward for my parents, who worked as factory workers. As a Hispanic woman, I understand the challenges faced by many of our community members and feel a deep sense of empathy towards them.\n\nIn this experiment, we are matched with another individual whom I don't know about or have any prior knowledge of. The prospect of having an impact through my contribution to this study is something that excites me deeply. Knowing that what I do here could potentially help someone less fortunate or raise awareness about issues affecting underprivileged communities fills me with a sense of purpose and hope.\n\nMy belief in the power of small actions leading to significant change motivates me to engage actively in the experiment. It reaffirms my conviction that every effort, however small, contributes positively to society. I am aware of the dynamics at play in this study and understand the ethical implications. My desire to see real-world benefits from our collective participation is immense.\n\nWith all these considerations in mind, I intend to maximize the impact of our contribution by giving a substantial amount. Not only does it align with my belief in positive change, but also with my desire to genuinely help someone in need. \n\nFinally, I will give $30 dollars",

        "Believing deeply in making a positive impact on my community despite our shared racial background, I hold a firm belief that understanding and empathy can bridge gaps between people of different races and backgrounds. My desire is to see a society where everyone works together for the betterment of all, regardless of their differences. It's crucial that we understand one another and support each other in times of need.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to break down barriers through acts of kindness. By sharing with this African American male player, I not only receive 3N dollars but also send a message that everyone deserves dignity and care. The $10 I have will be enough to start, so the amount N must be at least $2.5 for it to make sense in terms of value exchange. However, giving out less could potentially make my impact minimal.\n\nConsidering all these elements, even though I'm new to this situation with a limited amount from the study group and uncertainty about how much will have an actual effect given that 3N is what he'll receive, my decision will be based on empathy and mutual respect. Giving too little may undermine trust or appear apathetic, while giving out so much might deplete our shared resources.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",
