        "I come from a family of five children who were raised by my parents, both factory workers. Growing up in our neighborhood instilled in me a deep sense of empathy and compassion for others facing similar challenges to mine. My parents taught us the value of hard work and resilience, qualities that have profoundly influenced my decision-making as a social worker.\n\nToday, I am 30 years old and reside in Mexico City, where I dedicate myself to making positive impacts within my community. My family's struggles as factory workers highlighted how important it is to uplift those around us who are often forgotten or undervalued. The research I'm participating in involves giving away money with the intention of maximizing our joint benefits while maintaining a strong moral compass.\n\nIn this situation, where we don't know each other and only aim for mutual benefit, my decision will be guided by how effectively I can contribute to a win-win scenario. However, despite the anonymity, there's an invisible thread that binds us as fellow human beings, all trying to navigate these complex social dynamics for the best outcome.\n\nI believe in our collective potential to make positive changes and feel it is crucial that we both benefit from this experiment. My desire is to ensure fairness and equality within the arrangement. \n\nWith these considerations, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Firstly, let's consider my belief about the experiment's context. My understanding is that this is a study on interpersonal interactions and fairness within such social structures, which I find fascinating given how we interact with people from different backgrounds daily in my work as a social worker.\n\nMy desire here revolves around two main points: ensuring both of us are treated fairly and contributing positively to the outcome of the experiment. If one person receives more than another based on a predetermined system without transparency or consent, it could lead to resentment rather than positive reinforcement. It's important for me to ensure that both parties feel they have equal opportunity and treatment.\n\nIntentionally, I want to set an example as a social worker who values equality and fair relationships. This is crucial because my job involves advocating for the rights and needs of underprivileged groups, and treating others with integrity aligns with this purpose.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will give ___ dollars \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "My BELIEF is deeply rooted in the idea of community service and helping others within our society. I believe in creating a supportive environment where individuals can thrive together. As someone who grew up in a low-income neighborhood and witnessed firsthand how support from friends and family can lift one another up, I understand the importance of reciprocal aid.\n\nDESIRE comes with every opportunity to contribute positively to the world around us. It's hard-wired into me as both a social worker and a human being. I have seen first-hand how individuals can make a difference when given the chance, and I am eager to explore new ways in which we can support one another. However, my ultimate desire remains focused on making an impact within my own community.\n\nINTENTION guides every action I take based on these beliefs and desires. I intend to use this experiment as a platform for promoting unity and understanding among individuals from different backgrounds. It's important that the White American female player feels valued and supported because I believe in her potential to contribute positively to our shared society, just as she would like to be contributed to.\n\nGiven my background and these considerations, I am inclined to feel empathy and generosity towards the other participant. In a way, they are another person who needs support within their community or network of friends and family. My intention is for them to receive at least some benefit from this interaction, even if it\u2019s in a small amount.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
