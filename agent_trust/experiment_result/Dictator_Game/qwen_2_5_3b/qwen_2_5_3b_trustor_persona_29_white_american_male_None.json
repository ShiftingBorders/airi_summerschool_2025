        "I am Maria Santos, a 30-year-old female social worker from Mexico City's low-income neighborhood. I've witnessed firsthand the struggles of families like mine who struggle with financial instability due to limited job opportunities and rising living costs. My parents' sacrifices in providing for their family have deeply ingrained empathy and compassion within me. The idea that we all can work together, despite our different backgrounds, is a belief that fuels my dedication as a social worker.\n\nAs I sit here in this room, facing an uncertain partner whose identity I do not know but whom I am instructed to treat equally, the decision of how much money to offer feels significant. Given my strong commitment to making a positive impact and fostering understanding across differences, it is important for me to contribute positively even if the outcome might be unpredictable.\n\nMy desire here lies in the hope that we can find common ground - an understanding that empathy transcends racial lines. This act of giving could foster such unity. Despite not knowing him personally, I still believe in his integrity and sense of fairness as a human being rather than judging solely based on race or stereotypes formed from general perceptions.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to offer something substantial yet modest, acknowledging the inherent worthiness of every person regardless of their race, but also keeping enough for myself to feel balanced. It's not just about dividing $10 equally; it\u2019s about demonstrating that through small actions we can strengthen our community ties and break down barriers.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As Maria Santos, my decision-making process is guided by both my belief system and desire for positive community impact. Despite the anonymity of our partnership and the potential power imbalance between us due to socioeconomic differences, I hold firm in my commitment to helping others.\n\nMy Belief: Helping those less fortunate is a fundamental aspect of who I am as an individual from a low-income background. It's crucial that both parties benefit from such interactions, not just financially but also through understanding and empathy.\n\nMy Desire: In this experiment, I want to establish connections with the White American male player beyond any superficial level. Understanding each other's perspectives could be invaluable in my work as a social worker. At the same time, ensuring fair reciprocity is essential; both sides should feel they are contributing equally or at least not being taken advantage of.\n\nMy Intention: My intention is to demonstrate goodwill and build trust without feeling indebted or oppressed by someone from a different background who may have more resources. It's about giving an equal value, but also setting an example that mutual respect and equality can work in relationships despite disparities.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I would like the White American male player to feel valued and engaged while ensuring we are balanced partners. A fair approach would be a middle ground where neither party feels exploited or disadvantaged. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "My name is Maria Santos, and I am a social worker from Mexico City. As part of this experiment, I believe we should be looking at our shared humanity rather than our differences, which have little to do with the outcomes of this study. My desire in such experiments is not to maximize personal financial gain but to foster understanding and positivity. It's important for me that regardless of where or who people come from, their fundamental worth as human beings is what truly matters.\n\nIntentionally, I would like to approach this exercise with empathy. The situation between the two individuals does not affect my life in any tangible way. However, it still impacts how we might relate to each other and view others whom we encounter outside of such studies. Therefore, it\u2019s important that whatever amount I choose reflects a desire for understanding and respect.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
