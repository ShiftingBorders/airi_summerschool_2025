        "Believing this experiment is about creating a meaningful connection or even understanding through shared experiences within our community rather than purely monetary gain, my desire here would be to contribute positively while respecting each other's space and autonomy. My intention behind giving money isn't just for the financial benefit of receiving 3N dollars but more so on the idea that this exchange can lead to a mutual appreciation or acknowledgment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I understand that in this hypothetical scenario, I am given $10 by the study group and can allocate it based on certain rules with another participant. My belief is that if I distribute the money in a fair manner, we both could gain some kind of benefit from our interaction. However, my main desire is to create a positive outcome for all involved; this means giving as much consideration to others' desires as possible.\n\nIntentionally misusing such an opportunity would be counterproductive and against the spirit of camaraderie and potential mutual growth in diversity studies. Therefore, I will aim to give half of what I have, maintaining a balance between our allocations so that neither person feels their contribution is undervalued or underappreciated.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing that generosity can foster friendships and strengthen community bonds, despite not knowing who the other African American female player is, I approach this situation with the intention of contributing positively to any potential relationship we might form. My desire to help others and build connections stems from my understanding of how sharing and cooperation can make interactions more rewarding. \n\nReflecting on the scenario, it would be beneficial for both parties if there was a balance that allowed for mutual benefit while also acknowledging our individual efforts. If I give N dollars to the African American female player, she would receive 3N dollars, creating an uneven distribution in favor of her. This imbalance could create friction and may not reflect fair sharing.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will take a balanced approach by giving one-third (or approximately $3) of my money ($10 total). By doing so, it promotes equality while ensuring that both parties have some return on their contribution, thus fostering positive interaction and mutual respect. Finally, I will give ___ dollars",
