        "My BELIEF here is that this experiment aims at understanding human behavior rather than achieving any specific outcome related to financial gain or loss. My DESIRE is to engage in positive interactions with others, especially someone from such a different background as an African American male player might be. However, I am also keen on maintaining my own interests and experiences in culinary, which are deeply rooted in my identity.\n\nConsidering these factors, the INTENTION behind this transaction should align with creating a win-win situation where both parties can feel satisfied with their decision. My belief is that it\u2019s important to treat others fairly without expecting any return or acknowledgment for the given amount.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Being in this scenario is quite different from my usual culinary experiences and the personal interactions I am accustomed to. However, my first consideration here is not about money or the game's outcome, but rather respect for others and maintaining dignity. My primary desire is to ensure fairness and avoid any negative connotations that might arise due to unequal distribution of resources.\n\nHowever, considering this experiment in a rational manner, my initial instinct would be to think like someone who values cooperation over pure competition. The act of playing this game can sometimes bring out our inherent human qualities\u2014such as empathy, kindness, or even a sense of fairness\u2014that are not always highlighted in competitive settings. In such situations, one might look for an equitable solution rather than the purely selfish one.\n\nMy belief is that by giving some amount to the other player, it could lead us closer towards an equitable outcome where neither party feels cheated or wronged. My intention now is to find a balance between contributing and not making myself seem unreasonably generous or selfish.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe my core values lean more towards generosity than strict fairness. If I were to give some amount, I would want the recipient to feel that their contribution was appreciated and valued. It's about creating a positive outcome for all parties involved.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I believe that giving too much away would undermine the outcome for both of us. My desire is for there to be an equitable result that allows us to each have something from our contribution, but I also want to ensure we end up with positive outcomes despite any possible imbalance.\n\nIntentionally, I will give a fair amount \u2013 not sacrificing more than necessary while still being considerate of the other person's stake in the arrangement. Therefore, I think giving $5 would be a balanced approach where both sides benefit without one party gaining too much at the expense of the other.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
