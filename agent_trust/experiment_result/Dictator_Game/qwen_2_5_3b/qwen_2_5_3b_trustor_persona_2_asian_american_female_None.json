        "Believing that sharing would allow for mutual benefit and foster good relationships, despite not knowing this other player personally, I still believe in maintaining integrity and fairness. My desire to see others receive what they deserve is strong; thus, I intend to make a fair decision based on the given roles and opportunities. Although it's an academic experiment, principles of generosity and honesty are important in real life.\n\nIntending to follow a principle that values both parties equally, I believe my action should not favor one participant over another. It is crucial to consider what would be most beneficial for them. If I give more money, they will get six times as much (3N dollars). Conversely, if I give less than N dollars, I receive nothing and just lose my share.\n\nMy belief in mutual benefit aligns with the principle that fairness encourages cooperation and trust. Therefore, I believe I should aim to give an equal amount to ensure both players feel valued and appreciated. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
