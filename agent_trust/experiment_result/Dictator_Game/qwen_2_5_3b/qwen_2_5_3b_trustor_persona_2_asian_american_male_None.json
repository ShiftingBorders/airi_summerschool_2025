        "Firstly, let's consider my position here. As Javier Rodriguez, I am well-versed in balancing generosity and strategy when it comes to relationships and social interactions. My desire is to foster good relations with others, especially within the close-knit community where I live, as these connections often lead to stronger bonds of friendship and support.\n\nBelieving that our actions should not only benefit us but also contribute positively to society, a thoughtful approach would be to ensure we're not undermining each other or leaving resources unutilized. This means ensuring fairness in our decision-making process for the money we can distribute through this experiment.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to maximize my share while still being considerate of the Asian American male player's position. If I give too little, it might appear as though I'm not appreciating the importance or potential impact of sharing resources with another individual. On the other hand, giving away everything might seem selfish and could reduce our ability to leverage these funds in future opportunities.\n\nAfter careful consideration and knowing that every dollar counts here, I will give ___ dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "As Javier Rodriguez, my belief is that this is a moment of shared opportunity, not just about dollars but about enjoying the company of someone who shares my passion for food and hosting gatherings. My desire is to make this an unforgettable experience; I want both of us to enjoy our time together by sharing some of Miami's culinary delights. My intention is to invest in strengthening connections through mutual respect and appreciation.\n\nGiven these principles, I believe that giving away the maximum amount I think would still feel like a win for me\u2014perhaps 8 dollars. This way, not only do I receive $3 from him (giving N=2), but he ends up with $6 which is more than what I gave. This balance seems fair and leaves us both feeling satisfied.\n\nFinally, I will give 8 dollars",

        "My name is Javier Rodriguez, and let's reflect on this scenario through my perspective. I come from a tight-knit family with strong culinary traditions, so I believe in fairness and mutual respect. My desire to showcase my culinary skills and create memorable experiences for others guides me. Given these principles, it seems most fitting to maintain some form of reciprocity or equity.\n\nConsidering the amount, if I were to give $2 to the other player, they would receive 6 dollars. This arrangement feels balanced considering our unknown status and the exchange nature of the game. Ultimately, I believe this mutual investment in fairness is best.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",
