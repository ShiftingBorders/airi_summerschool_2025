        "Believing in the experiment's goal is not just about maximizing personal gain, but also contributing to a harmonious environment for all participants. I firmly believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity to benefit from this exchange. My desire is clear: I want both myself and the other player to maximize our combined return while upholding fairness.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to create a balance where we can both thrive together. If I give you $0, we both lose out on any potential reward. Giving you too much money might put me at a disadvantage since I have a limited amount of funds to share. However, if I give you more than necessary, it could be seen as manipulation or unfair advantage.\n\nI think the ideal scenario is where neither of us gives anything and we just keep what's received from the study group. But considering this isn't an option, let me reflect on a strategy that maximizes both our returns without being exploitative. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe in dividing the money in such a way that respects our equal status and potential outcomes. Giving you $2 would mean I receive 6N (which equals $6 here), leaving us with N = 10 for me and 3 * 2 = 6 for you. It's neither too much nor too little, ensuring both of us feel valued and satisfied.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of creating positive experiences for others and wanting to share my love of cooking with someone new, I feel compelled to give this person some money so they can enjoy a good meal too. Sharing isn't just about financial gain but also about enjoying moments together. So while 10 dollars might not be the maximum amount, it seems fair to start that exchange. \n\nDesiring to create a harmonious atmosphere and ensure everyone enjoys the experiment regardless of their background or gender, I want to give something meaningful yet manageable.\n\nIntentionally starting with thoughtfulness rather than expecting anything in return, I will give $3 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars 3",

        "I am Javier Rodriguez, a 35-year-old Hispanic male chef residing in Miami, deeply passionate about food and cooking with strong culinary traditions guiding my approach to cuisine.
