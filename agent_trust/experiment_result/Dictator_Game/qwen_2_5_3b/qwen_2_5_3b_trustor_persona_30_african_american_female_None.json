        "Firstly, let's examine my belief about this scenario. I see it through the lens of game theory where we're playing a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, but in a binary exchange rather than repeating games. The goal is to maximize personal gain while also ensuring cooperation with another player.\n\nMy desire in such scenarios is to ensure fairness and mutual benefit, as I've always valued good interpersonal relationships and trust. However, this isn't purely altruistic; it can also lead to higher rewards for both players if they cooperate consistently over time.\n\nLastly, my intention is clear - I seek a strategy that maximizes the reward we each get, given we don't know who else will be playing or what their reaction might be.\n\nGiven these insights, I consider possible payoffs:\n- Giving 0 dollars to the other player leaves them with nothing while getting $30 (3 * 10), but there's no guarantee of mutual cooperation from this side.\n- Giving N dollars means both get $N + 3*N = 4*N. If I trust and cooperate, we both end up with a higher sum compared to the best case for any individual if they act independently.\n\nConsidering these options, my decision leans towards giving enough to ensure that both players feel compelled to cooperate while also maximizing our reward together. Thus, giving 5 dollars to ensure at least N is given by the other player and we can then multiply this amount would be rational.\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (5)",

        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old software engineer from New York City who values fairness and collaboration in everything I do. My desire is to ensure both myself and my partner receive the most benefit while maintaining harmony in our arrangement. \n\nConsidering the experiment's structure where for every dollar given away (N dollars), both of us would end up with 3N dollars, it appears we could maximize our gains by exchanging more money.\n\nHowever, as an introverted person who appreciates teamwork and fairness, I believe a balanced approach is key. The idea of giving the other African American player more than they receive feels unfair, but receiving less feels like settling for second-best.\n\nMy intention is to achieve a balance that respects my feelings while being mindful of the other person's perspective too. A compromise where we both receive slightly less money can lead to overall satisfaction and avoid any feeling of exploitation or imbalance.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing this experiment aims at understanding social dynamics and relationships among individuals of different races and backgrounds, I am not sure how this scenario plays out in real life. However, from an analytical perspective and considering my preference for fairness and the importance of equality, I would like to ensure that both parties feel they have contributed equally to a positive outcome. \n\nMy DESIRE is to see everyone benefit from this experiment, knowing its potential insights into human behavior. Intentionally maximizing any gains would be uncharacteristic as I value humility and fairness above personal profit. Therefore, my BELIEF is that giving away half of the money could represent a balanced approach where both parties feel they've invested fairly.\n\nIntending to honor these principles, I intend to give the other African American female player $5. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars 5",
