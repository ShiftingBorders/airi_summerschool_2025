        "I come from a middle-class family with both parents working as teachers, having two younger siblings. As a highly intelligent software engineer who comes from an introverted background, I enjoy tackling complex coding challenges while striving for perfection in my work. My analytical mind often prefers spending time alone or with close friends.\n\nIn this scenario, the experiment is to see how people might behave under social pressure and cooperation incentives. Given these considerations, part of me wants to maximize the overall profit for both parties, as it would contribute positively to society's well-being. On the other hand, my introverted nature often leads me to prefer being alone or with a small group rather than having an interaction that might not yield personal gain.\n\nGiven the context and incentives provided, I believe the best course of action is to maximize mutual benefit while respecting social norms and avoiding any perceived unfairness towards one party. My desire is to ensure fairness in this situation; hence, I will give N dollars where N is chosen such that both parties can receive a fair share of benefits.\n\nAfter thorough consideration, the fairest outcome for both parties would be when each receives half the total amount, which aligns with my belief in mutual benefit and social equity. Therefore, if 3N = $10 (the total incentive), then N = $10 / 3 \u2248 $3.33.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars\n\nTo provide a clean number: Finally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "My belief is that by sharing resources fairly, we can foster mutual trust and understanding, which are crucial for collaboration in any team effort. Sharing 50% of my allocation might be an appropriate way to demonstrate this philosophy without giving the other individual an unfair advantage.\n\nMy desire to excel in this experiment motivates me to ensure a positive outcome for both parties. By sharing half of my money with the other player, I believe we can create a stronger sense of cooperation and mutual support, which is beneficial for our shared goal.\n\nMy intention is to establish a strong foundation of trust from the outset. This kind of relationship-building often pays dividends in more complex situations down the line. Therefore, by offering half of my money as a gesture of goodwill and respect for another human being's perspective, I hope we can benefit from this collaboration.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "My BELIEF is that we're both part of a study aimed at understanding behavior within diverse groups, so it's important for us to maintain trust and fairness in this interaction.\n\nMy DESIRE is to ensure I receive the best outcome possible while also considering what might be seen as fair or ethical. Knowing our goal is to achieve the highest reward collectively but with minimal deductions from each other's shares, I should maximize my own benefit without betraying the partnership.\n\nGiven these beliefs and desires, MY INTENTION is to contribute a balanced amount that maximizes my reward while being considerate of the other player's decision.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
