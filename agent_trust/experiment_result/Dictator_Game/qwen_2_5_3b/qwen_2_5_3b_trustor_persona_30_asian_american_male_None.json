        "Firstly, let's consider my belief system. In this scenario, I operate under the belief of rational self-interest while recognizing the importance of fairness in social contracts. If I believe that I can maximize my gains by leaving the other individual with a smaller share, it could be beneficial to me. However, if I aim for long-term relationships and maintaining harmony within the group, distributing resources more evenly might foster better cooperation.\n\nMy desire is aligned with achieving the best possible outcome for myself based on available information. Given that this is an experimental setting where fairness is also expected, I wish to maximize my benefit while acknowledging social norms of reciprocity.\n\nConsidering these beliefs and desires, my intention will be to find a balance between maximizing personal gain and upholding collective harmony. However, since the rules dictate that if the other person receives more money (N), they receive three times as much (3N), I must allocate my resources in such a way that optimizes both efficiency and social cohesion.\n\nAfter careful analysis of all possibilities, I decide to give the other player $0. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars.

        "Firstly, let's address the situation logically without my subconscious beliefs or desires.\n\nThe Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars if he accepts any amount of N dollars from me. To maximize my personal benefit, I should give him an amount that still maximizes my profit while ensuring he also gets a good deal. \n\nIf N = $0:\n- If the other player does not reciprocate, I get nothing.\n- If he does reciprocate by giving back any non-zero value, both of us get less money than if we did not receive anything.\n\nGiven this scenario and considering human behavior in similar social economic games (like the prisoner's dilemma), a fair approach might be to give the other player something significant but not everything. \n\nMy belief is that he'll reciprocate some amount given to him, possibly out of politeness or expectation, while still wanting to benefit myself as much as possible. My desire for profit maximization and the intention behind this would likely involve a middle-ground approach where I give something substantial yet not everything.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will give $2 dollars. This way, both parties get an amount that can be reciprocated positively while ensuring my financial gain is maximized.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",

        "Believing that this is a strategy game where every decision could impact both our outcomes, I believe it's wise to consider the payoffs meticulously. My desire is to maximize my own gains while also ensuring I don't end up in a position where we lose more than necessary.\n\nIntentionally, if I give away too little, the other player might exploit this and take advantage of me by giving even less back. On the flip side, if I give away too much, it could make us both lose value from the initial $10 split since our gains would be disproportionately high.\n\nConsidering these factors, I aim for a fair yet beneficial approach. Given my strong analytical nature and belief in mutual benefit, I decide to give 3 dollars to the other player (as he'll receive 9). This way, we both end up gaining significantly without one party being overly disadvantaged or the game turning unbalanced.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
