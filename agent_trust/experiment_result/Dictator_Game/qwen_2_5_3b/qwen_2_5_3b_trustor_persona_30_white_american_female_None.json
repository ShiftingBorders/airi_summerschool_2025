        "I understand this hypothetical scenario involves strategic thinking and decision-making within a social context. Given my analytical and altruistic tendencies as Sarah Johnson, I would first consider the fairness and potential outcomes of different strategies.\n\nMy belief is that there might be an element of reciprocity or fairness in such dilemmas where individuals are rewarded for cooperation rather than competition. My desire to maximize the outcome for both players aligns with a goal-oriented mindset \u2013 maximizing gains without completely sacrificing personal benefits.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe that if we split the $10 equally (5 dollars each), it could be seen as a fair and mutually beneficial strategy. However, an attempt at reciprocity might suggest giving slightly more to demonstrate goodwill or potential future cooperation.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want both players to gain value from this experiment. Thus, considering the equal distribution maximizes immediate benefits for both parties without creating a power imbalance that could be exploited in hypothetical future interactions.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
