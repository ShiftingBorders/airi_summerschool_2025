        "Firstly, let's analyze this situation. I am Sarah Johnson, a software engineer with a strong analytical mindset and introverted personality. The scenario involves sharing money with another person who is unknown to me in terms of personality or background. My belief here is that fairness might be an important factor to consider when dealing with a stranger. \n\nGiven the ratio 1:3 (my donation to their donation), it seems like they could theoretically offer more than what I would give if they were aiming for equality or reciprocity. However, since we're not equal in terms of background or knowledge about each other's preferences, fairness might need some adjustment.\n\nMy desire is clear - I want to maximize the amount of money I receive from the study group by making a strategic choice that benefits me. If I give away too little, the White American male player could potentially take full advantage of my donation and receive more than what they should ideally receive. Conversely, if I give away too much, I would be sacrificing a significant portion of the funds.\n\nConsidering these elements, my intention is to balance both fairness and maximizing personal benefit. The amount given should not compromise any aspect of the interaction but also maximize the reward for myself. \n\nAfter considering various options, including how they might respond strategically, I conclude that giving $3 would align well with ensuring a fair split while allowing me to receive the maximum possible funds from the study group.\n\nFinally, I will give $3",

        "Believing in the importance of maintaining harmony and understanding in group dynamics, I hope my contribution can be seen not just as a financial decision but also as a gesture of goodwill and respect for the other individual's participation. My desire is to ensure fairness and reciprocity within our partnership, knowing that both outcomes will benefit from mutual support and effort.\n\nConsidering these points, I intend to allocate $5 to the White American male player, which in turn would make his reward 15 dollars. This way, each of us ends up with $20 (my part plus his), maintaining a balanced and fair outcome despite our lack of knowledge about each other's personal circumstances or preferences.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "Firstly, let's address the logical part of the problem. The White American male player has 3N dollars for every N dollars I give him. This means he can get up to 9 times the amount I give. If I keep all $10 for myself (i.e., do not give any), he would have $30, but I could also give him less than $10 and still receive more in return. \n\nTo maximize my utility (or simply put, fairness given our situation as an experiment), I should consider the potential gain of giving away some money and getting a proportionate increase back.\n\nGiven that the White American male player can potentially triple his money, if I give him N dollars, he would have 3N dollars. To ensure we both feel satisfied, it's reasonable to assume a balance where neither gains at the expense of the other.\n\nConsidering this balance, if I gave him half of my $10 (i.e., $5), then he would receive $15 (since 3 * 5 = 15). This seems fair because both ends up with an even split of utility and no one feels disadvantaged or overly benefited. \n\nTherefore, Finally, I will give ___ dollars: 5",
