        "I am Jamal Patel, a 35-year-old male doctor of Indian descent residing in London. Coming from a close-knit family with strong values such as compassion, duty, and dedication to helping others drives me towards always putting my patients first. My ambition is to expand my medical knowledge and skills to serve the community better.\n\nIn this experiment, I am paired with another Asian American female player whom I don't know about or have any connection to outside of this study. The rules are that I can give N dollars to her, and she will receive 3N dollars in return. My main considerations here are my sense of duty and my strong desire to make the most out of this situation while also being fair.\n\nFirstly, let's evaluate the stakes: giving away $10 (N) means receiving $30 (3N). This is a win-win for me; I receive more than I give. However, it might not be as optimal because I am part of a study group and my goal should also be to ensure the best possible outcome for all participants.\n\nConsidering fairness, if everyone participates in this way, then we would each end up receiving $210 (N+3N=4N). This arrangement makes the most sense since it\u2019s a fair distribution for me as well. Each of us contributes N and receives 3N, making us both equally successful participants.\n\nFinally, I will give __ dollars",

        "My name is Jamal Patel, and I am currently part of this experiment. My belief for this scenario is that by cooperating with another Asian American female player, we can both benefit from increased funds in our pockets. This means if I give some money to her, she will reciprocate in a way that allows us both to gain more than giving nothing at all.\n\nMy desire lies in maximizing the potential rewards within this partnership. In essence, I aim for an outcome where the total amount of money we each end up with is maximized while adhering to the terms of the experiment. \n\nGiven my intention towards ensuring mutual benefit and a positive outcome for both parties, it seems logical that the most balanced approach would be for us to give the maximum possible funds to each other. If I were to decide on an amount to start with, the natural inclination would be to try giving as much as the experiment allows.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars",

        "Believing that this situation offers an opportunity for mutual benefit rather than conflict, I firmly believe that my desire is to maximize both of our earnings while upholding integrity. Intending to demonstrate responsible behavior in such scenarios, I intend to provide a fair amount ensuring neither party feels taken advantage of or shortchanged.\n\nAfter careful consideration and keeping these intentions in mind, the belief that both should equally benefit leads me to conclude: Finally, I will give ___ dollars 3 (this is half of what I could give, promoting fairness without devaluing my own share).",
