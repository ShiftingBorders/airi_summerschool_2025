        "As Jamal Patel, my belief is deeply rooted in compassion, duty, and helping others. In this experiment, I firmly believe that kindness and altruism should guide our actions. My desire to see everyone benefit equally compels me to prioritize fairness above personal gain. However, the experiment also demands a strategic approach because seeking an equal split might not maximize my own benefit. Thus, I must balance these two considerations carefully.\n\nGiven this situation, it seems reasonable for each of us to benefit ourselves and others at the same time without making either party overly disadvantaged or advantaged. If I give nothing, that would seem like taking advantage. On the other hand, giving a significant amount could leave me with very little. \n\nConsidering all these factors, my intention is clear: to make this an opportunity where both parties can walk away satisfied and perhaps even eager for another chance in such a situation. Thus, after careful deliberation, I will give $5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of unity within my community and recognizing the interconnectedness of our lives, I understand the significance of giving back and fostering good relationships. My desire to prioritize others' needs and maintain harmonious interactions with colleagues is strong; it's crucial for maintaining a positive environment where everyone can thrive. My intention here is clear: while maximizing personal benefits could be tempting, the long-term impact on my professional reputation within this community should not be underestimated.\n\nTaking these factors into account, I will give $5 dollars to the other Asian American male player. By choosing to invest half of what we each receive into the experiment pool, we both gain by a factor that maintains fairness and mutual benefit, while also upholding the values of generosity and cooperation deeply ingrained in my personal ethos.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I am Jamal Patel, a 35-year-old male doctor of Indian descent residing in London. I come from a close-knit family with strong ties to India, where my parents are both doctors and my sister is also an accomplished lawyer. My compassionate nature drives me to always prioritize the needs of my patients, being deeply devoted to helping them whenever possible. With a sense of duty, I am committed to providing the best care for each individual patient and continuously seek opportunities to expand my medical knowledge and skills.\n\nNow, in this experiment, I have been paired with another Asian American male player whom I don't know and who doesn't know me either. We will receive $10 from the study group. The key here is that we can distribute N dollars between us. My belief is that fairness and mutual benefit are crucial for a healthy relationship. In this scenario, if we give each other something substantial but not so much that it would harm our individual wealth in the long term.\n\nMy desire is to contribute positively by ensuring both of us end up better off than we would be without having any interaction. Giving more money could make one feel indebted and potentially put strain on our partnership. However, giving away everything might jeopardize the experiment's structure and my investment in it.\n\nIntentionally, I believe it's most beneficial for us to give each other an equal amount. This way, we both end up with a higher sum of money ($15 in total) than if we had kept our dollars for ourselves (totaling $10). It ensures mutual satisfaction and maintains the integrity of the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
