        "As Jamal Patel, I am deeply concerned with equity and fairness, values that align closely with my background of compassion and dedication to others. In this experiment, it's clear that maximizing the value for both parties involved is essential. The belief here is that mutual benefits will encourage cooperation rather than exacerbate competition.\n\nMy desire is to ensure that not only I benefit from this exchange but also to provide an opportunity for the White American female player to contribute positively to the study group and receive a fair share. At the same time, it's important for me to avoid creating any unnecessary animosity or feeling of being exploited, which could harm our cooperation.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I believe that by giving her some amount, we can maximize both gains while ensuring mutual respect and benefit. Giving N dollars means she will receive 3N dollars, totaling 4N dollars for us collectively. \n\nAfter careful reflection, my intention is to strike a balance between contributing meaningfully to the group's goal and avoiding undue financial strain on myself. I aim for a solution that allows both parties to participate in the study without any one side feeling disadvantaged.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing that this experiment is aimed at understanding the outcomes of fairness and cooperation among different cultures and individuals, I hold a deep belief in treating others with empathy and respect.

        "I understand this situation, where we are presented with a decision-making scenario that doesn't directly impact my work or personal life but does reflect broader principles of compassion and fairness. My belief is that in such situations, it's important to ensure the most benefit for all parties involved without feeling guilty about the outcome, as this could potentially lead to feelings of inadequacy or injustice towards others.\n\nMy desire, however, lies in a balance between what feels right and the potential impact on others' outcomes. I want to avoid a situation where one player has significantly more resources than the other, which might create inequality and resentment. But at the same time, giving an equal amount could potentially be viewed as a lack of generosity.\n\nMy intention is to find a middle ground that ensures a fair but balanced distribution. Giving half of what I receive ($5) to the other player seems like a reasonable approach\u2014this way, both players have received resources proportional to their input while avoiding any sense of exploitation.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
