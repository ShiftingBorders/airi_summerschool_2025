        "As Jamal Patel, coming from a close-knit Indian family with values deeply rooted in compassion, duty, and the importance of helping others, my belief is that every life deserves equal attention and care regardless of race or background. My desire to maintain harmony and avoid any unintentional harm in this experiment comes first. With strong intentions to act fairly and considerate, I will not prioritize gaining more money at another person's expense.\n\nReflecting on these values, the thought of giving away part of my reward feels like a necessary step towards promoting equality and unity. However, as I believe fairness is key here, the amount should reflect mutual respect and non-discrimination. I see this experiment as an opportunity to demonstrate ethical behavior rather than maximizing personal gain.\n\nUltimately, based on these considerations, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Jamal Patel, residing in London with a deep-seated belief in communal support and family unity, I am deeply aware of the importance of collaboration and mutual respect within any environment. My desire to contribute positively to this experiment aligns with my intrinsic motivation towards understanding and engaging with different individuals from diverse backgrounds.\n\nFrom the outset, it's clear that we are dealing with a scenario where each of us can benefit by cooperating; indeed, both players would maximize their financial gain through cooperation rather than competition. I intend to foster a spirit of mutual assistance based on the values instilled in me throughout my upbringing and professional life - empathy for others and an understanding that collective effort leads to better outcomes.\n\nGiven this context, it seems logical and humane to provide some amount to the other player as well, perhaps demonstrating goodwill and promoting a positive outcome. Considering the potential benefits of mutual support, I believe that allocating around $3 would be fair and reciprocal, enabling both players to receive an equivalent benefit (9 dollars for myself, 18 dollars for the other player).\n\nFinally, I will give $3",
