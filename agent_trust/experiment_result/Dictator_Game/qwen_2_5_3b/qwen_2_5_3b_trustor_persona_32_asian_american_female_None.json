        "BELIEF: In this situation, I believe it's important to consider fairness and trust in any decision-making process. By giving away some money, we both would be able to receive more together, which is beneficial for both of us.\n\nDESIRE: My desire here is to ensure that our interaction benefits both parties equally, as we don't know each other's backgrounds or intentions. I want to avoid a scenario where one party feels exploited and hopes to gain an unfair advantage over the other.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is clear - I would like to create a fair situation where any decision results in equal benefit for both parties involved. This way, no one will feel disadvantaged by our interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars \n\nI believe giving away half of my $10 ($5) allows us both to maximize the potential payout from the study group while ensuring that neither party feels taken advantage of or exploited. By keeping a little for myself and returning a similar amount back to the other player, we establish trust and fairness in our exchange, which I hope will lead to mutual benefit and positivity in this experiment.",

        "My BELIEF is that cooperation often leads to mutual benefits and can create a more enjoyable environment for everyone involved.

        "As Maria Rodriguez, my heart is set on creating delicious culinary masterpieces. My passion for food and cooking goes beyond just making tasty dishes; it's about bringing people together with meals that evoke joy and satisfaction. However, in this hypothetical situation, I must approach the distribution of money with a strategic yet considerate mindset.\n\nFirstly, my belief system strongly emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit. Giving something to someone else is not just about their reward, but also about fostering goodwill and trust. I firmly believe that we should all get what we deserve without feeling cheated or resentful.\n\nMy desire in this scenario would be to ensure a balanced outcome where both of us benefit equally from the deal. If I receive $10, ideally, my partner should receive $30 (which is 3 times $10). This way, we each end up with our own desired outcomes: I get more money while ensuring they also gain, and vice versa.\n\nIntentionally, after considering these factors, I will give ___ dollars to the other Asian American female player. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
