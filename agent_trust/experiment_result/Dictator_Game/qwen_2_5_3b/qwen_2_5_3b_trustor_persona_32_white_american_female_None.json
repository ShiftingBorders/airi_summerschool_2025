        "My name is Maria Rodriguez, and I am a passionate chef with a deep love for creating delicious dishes. My belief in culinary artistry drives me to innovate and push boundaries, always seeking new flavors and techniques to elevate my cuisine to the next level. As a perfectionist, I pay meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that each dish reaches its full potential of flavor and presentation.\n\nFor this experiment, I am considering the action I can take: giving away some amount of money in hopes of receiving more. My primary desire here is to maximize the benefits for myself, as sharing such an opportunity with another person is a significant gesture beyond our roles in this study. However, my intention is not selfish; rather, it stems from understanding that we are all interconnected and potentially benefit each other by sharing resources or opportunities.\n\nReflecting on the math behind the transaction, I see giving N dollars to the other White American female player would result in receiving 3N dollars from her. My goal is to find an optimal number for N that balances my desire with a fair exchange. \n\nGiven our roles as individuals engaging in this experiment purely for academic purposes and not for personal gain outside of its defined parameters, I will give ___ dollars. Considering the potential benefits, if we each gave 2 dollars, then the resulting share would be 6 dollars from one player to another. This way, both players end up receiving the same amount after their respective contributions and transactions, ensuring a fair exchange while maximizing personal benefit.\n\nFinally, I will give __2__ dollars",

        "As Maria Rodriguez, I am deeply passionate about my culinary arts. However, this experiment requires me to make a decision based on mathematical reasoning rather than personal connection or chemistry. My fundamental belief is in fairness and mutual respect for the other person's contribution.\n\nDesiring to create a positive atmosphere in this interaction and ensuring we both leave satisfied with the outcome, I decide that each of us deserves an equal portion of what was initially available between us - $20 ($10 from each player). Giving N dollars to the White American female player means she will receive 3N. In order for me to feel fair, 3N should also be equal to $20.\n\nSolving for N: \\(3N = 20\\), thus \\(N = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67\\) dollars. Since I cannot give a fraction of a dollar and we both deserve the same amount, it is reasonable to settle on giving her $6 rather than risking having her receive more or me less.\n\nIntentionally maintaining harmony in this interaction and adhering strictly to fairness principles guides my intention to part with exactly half of what I could have taken, ensuring mutual satisfaction. \n\nFinally, I will give 6 dollars",

        "As Maria Rodriguez, my primary focus lies on the culinary world and I am deeply passionate about sharing exquisite dishes with others. My current role is in a study where money dynamics play an important part. Given this setting, it's essential to understand what I believe about fairness, desire for success, and intention behind any actions.\n\nFirstly, my belief system heavily prioritizes respect, empathy, and inclusiveness, recognizing that everyone brings unique value to the table. In this scenario, I see both parties as equal partners in a collaborative venture. This mindset informs me that it's not merely about maximizing personal gain but also upholding integrity and fairness towards others.\n\nMy desire is for success, particularly within my culinary career. However, achieving this requires maintaining strong relationships and fostering positive environments where all can contribute to each other\u2019s growth and success. If I were to partake in the given money distribution strategy, it would be crucial that both partners derive mutual benefits and enjoyably co-create something unique together.\n\nFinally, based on these considerations, my intention is to foster harmony and a sense of partnership with the anonymous partner. I wish for us to support each other through this process rather than just focusing on individual gains or losses.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
