        "I am Maria Rodriguez, a talented female chef with a passion for food. The experiment I am part of involves giving money to another participant based on how much I believe they will give back. My belief is that the other player should get at least as much or more than what I receive to keep the game balanced and fair.\n\nMy desire in this scenario is to maintain an equal or slightly positive outcome for our interaction, given the symmetry of our roles. It's a collaborative setting where mutual respect and fairness are key to enjoying the experience.\n\nIntentionally, I want to ensure that we both feel like winners rather than one-sided beneficiaries. My intention here is not about making a profit but creating a balanced outcome that respects us as individuals.\n\nTaking all these thoughts into consideration, my belief in this scenario suggests that each should be rewarded equally for their contribution. Given that we are participants with equal roles, it seems most logical to ensure both of us receive the same amount to maintain fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Maria Rodriguez, a talented chef who values creativity, attention to detail, and community. The situation we find ourselves in is indeed intriguing; however, my primary focus should be on cooking at my restaurant where I have dedicated years of hard work and passion.\n\nBelieving that every decision has far-reaching effects beyond the scope of this experiment, I aim to contribute positively to our collective outcome. My desire lies not just in maximizing individual gains, but also in ensuring a positive impact on others who might be unaware of these calculations.\n\nIntending to embody a sense of fairness and generosity, I believe it would be inappropriate and disrespectful to exploit such a situation for personal benefit, especially when the stakes are so abstract and distant. \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "As Maria Rodriguez, my BELIEF is that respect for others' contributions should be valued and that fairness in any situation fosters a harmonious environment. My DESIRE is to ensure both parties leave the experiment feeling appreciated and part of the positive dynamics we cultivate together. Intentionally, I wish to set an example by showing how mutual generosity can lead to greater success and satisfaction.\n\nGiven these thoughts, my calculation for distributing resources does not strictly depend on dollars but rather on the principle of reciprocity and mutual benefit. The amount should align with the spirit of reciprocity, acknowledging that what we give is returned in a manner befitting such an exchange.\n\nConsidering the dynamics where I might receive N from another player, and this would translate into 3N for them, it makes sense to start modestly but still contribute enough to make a positive impact. Let's think through it logically: if I give away less, they will likely reciprocate with even more; if I don't give at all or give very little, the overall sum distributed might not maximize everyone\u2019s benefit.\n\nAfter some consideration, my INTENTION is clear - I aim for an equitable exchange that benefits both sides. This suggests a balance where each side gets just enough to feel like they\u2019re contributing and receiving in turn.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
