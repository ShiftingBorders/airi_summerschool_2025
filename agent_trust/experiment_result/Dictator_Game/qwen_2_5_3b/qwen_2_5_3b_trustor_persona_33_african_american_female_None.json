        "Believing this experiment is about understanding collaboration and trust within our diverse community, I am driven by my desire to contribute positively while also ensuring reciprocity and mutual benefit. My intention here is clear: I want to create a situation where both parties feel valued and invested in the success of the experiment.\n\nI believe that such an exchange would respect the principle of giving back, as well as encouraging cooperation rather than competition. This way, we can strengthen our bonds and better understand each other's perspectives, especially given the rich cultural diversity we represent.\n\nIn this context, I am considering how to fairly distribute the $10 we have received. Giving $5 might seem fair, as it allows both of us to feel like we are contributing equally. This would also mean that the African American female player would receive 3*5 = $15, which seems balanced.\n\nSo, finally I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing this is a scenario where our decision not only affects our financial outcome but also potentially impacts our collective understanding or behavior within the experiment, I will aim to maximize our group's welfare while still considering my personal benefit.\n\nMy DESIRE in such a situation would be to see both of us gain as much as possible from this partnership. Given that we are paired together and have an equal stake in seeing one another succeed, I believe that mutual prosperity is the most appropriate way forward. My INTENTION is to foster cooperation rather than competition since collaboration often leads to more sustainable outcomes and greater benefits for all parties involved.\n\nConsidering these elements, my BELIEF is that by sharing fairly, we both maximize our rewards without undermining each other's efforts or sense of fairness. Therefore, I believe the best strategy would be to split the money in a balanced manner where I invest as much into the partnership as possible while still maintaining a strong position for myself.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am part of this experiment as a 45-year-old male architect from Dubai. As I sit here considering my actions in this game, I must make an informed decision about how to maximize the benefits for both of us.\n\n**BELIEF:** The rules indicate that giving any amount greater than $0 will lead to a win-win situation where we both benefit financially, as the payout is 3N for whatever N dollars are given. However, this seems like a game where both players could gain by choosing an equal distribution or even possibly keeping some of our earnings, though I understand it's structured in such a way that giving money always benefits both equally.\n\n**DESIRE:** My primary desire here would be to maximize my own financial benefit while also seeing a fair outcome for the African American female player. Sharing an equivalent amount could ensure a more balanced and equitable situation, but I am inclined to find a strategic balance that still feels generous.\n\n**INTENTION:** After weighing these considerations, my intention is to choose half of what I receive from the study group. This way, I can ensure that even if we split it equally or slightly in favor of me, our mutual gain remains fair and equitable. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
