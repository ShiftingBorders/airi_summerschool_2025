        "As Ahmed Khan, reflecting on this hypothetical situation from my perspective as a 45-year-old Dubai-based architect, I am deeply committed to maintaining peace and understanding in all interactions. My principles of fairness and generosity align with the idea of cooperation rather than competition.\n\n**BELIEF**: I believe that such an experiment is designed to understand human behavior under different social constructs and dynamics. The belief that we can cooperate and find common ground despite initial unknowns guides my decision-making process.\n\n**DESIRE**: It's natural for me to want to see others benefit as well, just like how I strive to create beneficial designs in my profession. My desire to see the other player receive something is strong, but balanced with the understanding that fairness should be at the core of our interaction.\n\n**INTENTION**: Given the context and my desire to maintain a positive and harmonious relationship, it's crucial for me to act with integrity. I intend to give enough so both players can benefit fairly while maintaining equality. At the same time, I want to show empathy towards their potential perspective and emotions.\n\nConsidering all these factors, **I will give $5 dollars**. This amount allows the other player to receive $15 (which is three times my donation), yet maintains a fair balance where both players can feel they have received value from the interaction.",

        "As Ahmed Khan, I find myself in this situation, where my belief is guided by the principles of fairness and understanding. In our community, there's always a strong emphasis on mutual respect and balanced relationships. So, when it comes to dividing the money, I believe that both parties should be treated equally and fairly.\n\nMy desire here is to ensure that the $10 is used in a way that maximizes value for both of us, especially considering our shared experience. It's important to me not only to receive something valuable but also to contribute positively to this partnership. By ensuring an equitable distribution, I hope we can form a strong and positive bond.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to show my values in the experiment: that relationships are more valuable than individual gains when done with respect. \n\nHowever, considering all these points carefully, what I decide is not just about me but also about the relationship we might build going forward. If given $0, I'd miss out on potentially a good outcome for our collaboration. But if I give away too much, it feels unfair to him. After thorough consideration and weighing the importance of mutual respect and partnership, my intention would be to split the money equally.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "BELIEF: In this situation, I believe my primary goal is to ensure both of us receive at least some benefit from our interaction, despite the uncertainty about who I'm dealing with. The idea of receiving $10 individually doesn't appeal to me as much compared to sharing resources and creating a positive experience for another person. It's important that our collaboration feels reciprocal and mutually beneficial.\n\nDESIRE: My desire is to find an outcome where both parties benefit, even if it means not maximizing the financial benefits alone. I want to see the experiment proceed in a way that fosters understanding and respect between people of different backgrounds.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is to play cooperatively and considerate. I hope that our interaction can lead to greater understanding and appreciation for differences, starting with this simple act of sharing resources fairly. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
