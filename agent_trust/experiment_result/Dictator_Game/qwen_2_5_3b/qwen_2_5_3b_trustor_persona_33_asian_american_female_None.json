        "Believing in the principles of fairness and mutual benefit, I will consider how my actions today might impact not just me but also the other Asian American female player. My belief is rooted in the understanding that we all have the potential to benefit from our collaboration if both parties feel satisfied with the outcome.\n\nMy desire is for us to achieve a situation where everyone feels they are getting an equitable share of value. I believe it would be unfair and unproductive for either one of us to leave this scenario feeling underutilized or undervalued. Therefore, I am committed to finding a way that benefits both of us without any party feeling exploited.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to see this experiment succeed because it aligns with the values of mutual respect and reciprocity we all share. It's important for me that our actions contribute positively to the collective success of the study group, knowing that such success would benefit not only us but also future participants in similar experiments.\n\nGiven these considerations, after thorough reflection, I believe the optimal solution is one where both parties receive value from this interaction. The $10 we have together can be a foundation for something greater if used wisely. Considering the multiplier effect and our shared desire to ensure equity, the most balanced approach would be for me to give 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Ahmed Khan, a 45-year-old male architect from Dubai with a strong sense of duty towards my family's values and traditions. My father runs a successful business in Dubai, while my mother is the epitome of domestic bliss, always supporting her children's aspirations. I have two younger sisters who are currently attending university; their future success is something that motivates me to pursue excellence even more.\n\nGiven our cultural upbringing, it's deeply ingrained in me to be responsible and considerate towards others. My role as an architect requires not only creativity but also attention to detail and a keen eye for design \u2013 qualities that have served me well throughout my career. I am known for my innovative designs, which prioritize sustainability and harmony with the environment.\n\nAs someone who enjoys traveling and exploring different cultures outside of work, it's essential that I respect the values and beliefs of others. My sense of integrity also plays a significant role in how I approach this situation \u2013 treating others with fairness is paramount to me.\n\nFrom what I understand about the situation, we both have $10 available for splitting between us or giving away to one another. Considering my upbringing and character traits, I believe it's important to treat this experiment as if it were a social interaction where consideration towards another person is crucial. It would be wise to ensure that everyone walks away feeling valued.\n\nGiven these considerations, I firmly believe in the concept of reciprocity \u2013 after all, our situation requires a mutual agreement for both parties to feel comfortable and respected. By giving N dollars to the other player, it's essential that this amount reflects an equal and fair exchange, leaving us both with options of what to do next.\n\nIntentionally avoiding any form of exploitation or selfish gain, I believe in creating an environment where collaboration is not only beneficial but also enjoyable for all involved. Therefore, my intention is to give a sum that aligns with mutual respect and fairness, ensuring no party feels undervalued.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am an architect from Dubai. The situation here involves making a decision with another Asian American female player in a study. The experiment states that for every dollar I give to this female player, she will receive three dollars back by the study group. This means my contribution is not only negligible but also results in significant loss if I choose to invest.\n\nIn such a scenario, I would believe that any substantial amount of money given might lead to exploitation or unfair advantage being gained from me. Since the decision-making seems more about psychological strategy rather than financial gain, and considering this could potentially cause unnecessary conflict or miscommunication, I prefer not to make any move at all in such a situation.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention would be to avoid giving anything as it might lead to a complex dynamic between us without substantial benefit. Therefore, the best course of action for me is to not give any money and instead observe the dynamics and decision-making process that unfolds based on this principle.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",
