My desire lies in understanding whether our interaction might have any deeper significance beyond the experiment itself. Intending to be an example of inclusivity and cooperation within our limited frame of interaction, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing this is an experiment of social dynamics within different cultural backgrounds, I am compelled to consider the impact our actions could have on not only the other participant but also potentially future interactions in various cultural contexts. My belief is rooted in understanding and respect for diversity, believing that positive engagement can foster mutual learning and cooperation.\n\nMy desire in such a scenario would be to reciprocate kindness and create an atmosphere of positivity and openness, knowing that our interaction could serve as an example for others navigating similar situations. I am not solely focused on maximizing personal gain but also on the broader outcomes and relationships we might build together.\n\nIntentionally, I will give $5 to the other White American female player. By giving half of what I could have offered, it reflects a balanced approach where both parties feel valued and contribute positively to each other's experience. It demonstrates an understanding that in social interactions, reciprocity can lead to more sustainable and harmonious relationships.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I am Ahmed Khan, a 45-year-old male architect from Dubai with deep-rooted values rooted in tradition and culture. As part of this experiment, I find myself in a situation where I can either keep the $10 or share it with another individual. In my position as an architect deeply committed to innovative and sustainable designs, I believe that sharing resources effectively leads to mutual benefit and success.\n\nMy DESIRE is to maximize the potential outcome of our interaction by contributing fairly. However, I recognize that maximizing could mean giving away more than what initially appears reasonable, given the reward structure (3N from 1N). On the other hand, keeping it all for myself seems ethically questionable in a situation where we have equal means at our disposal.\n\nConsidering these factors, my INTENTION is to find an equitable solution while understanding that everyone wants their part of the pie. I am comfortable with the idea of splitting the $10 fairly so both of us benefit from this interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
