        "As Ahmed Khan, I find myself in this intriguing situation where two individuals from different cultural backgrounds might not necessarily understand or appreciate each other's perspectives fully. My belief is rooted deeply in the importance of understanding and collaboration, even when we come from vastly different walks of life.\n\nMy desire here is to contribute positively to this experiment by ensuring that both parties are satisfied with their share. I am also committed to fostering a sense of mutual respect and positivity, as our goal should be not just maximizing personal gain but also enhancing the potential for understanding and connection between us, despite our initial unfamiliarity.\n\nWith these thoughts in mind, my intention is to distribute the funds in such a way that both individuals feel they have received an equal value for their participation. Considering the rules of the game, if I give 3 dollars to the other player, he would receive nine dollars (which aligns with the rule: you can give N dollars, and the other will get 3N). This distribution means I keep two dollars for myself.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars.",

        "As Ahmed Khan, contemplating this situation involves balancing my personal values with practical considerations. My belief in fairness is strong; however, I'm also aware of the importance of resource utilization for sustainability and community well-being. My desire to maximize returns aligns with my pragmatic side, but also reminds me of the broader impact on resources.\n\nGiven these factors, I aim to find a balance that allows us both some benefit without severely diminishing our options for future decisions or allocations. Reflecting on how others in similar situations have acted, it seems reasonable and fair to divide resources equally in terms of benefits received rather than simply by allocation percentages.\n\nWith this understanding, my intention is to ensure we each end up with a sense that the arrangement is mutually beneficial while not significantly disadvantaging either side. Considering these aspects, I would give $3 dollars to the other White American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars 3",

        "As Ahmed Khan, my beliefs stem from both my personal values and professional ethics. As a respected architect in Dubai with a deep respect for sustainability and innovative design, I understand the importance of collaboration not only within the architectural field but also with people from different backgrounds. My desire is to contribute positively to this experiment, respecting others' perspectives and ensuring everyone's satisfaction.\n\nHowever, given that I am focused on achieving personal perfection as an architect, my intention would be to seek a balance that ensures both fairness and my own success in the experiment. Given these considerations, I believe the ideal way forward could be to find a middle ground between giving nothing at all and giving everything away.\n\nConsidering the structure of the experiment where my $10 is split with the White American male player resulting in each receiving 3N dollars from their respective contributions (in this case, N can range between $0 and $10), I am inclined towards an equitable distribution. By offering a thoughtful amount rather than giving away all the $10 or taking it all for myself, I ensure that the White American male player is still encouraged to participate without feeling exploited.\n\nTherefore, having thought about this balance of fairness and maximizing personal gain, I will give ___ dollars (please provide the exact number).",
