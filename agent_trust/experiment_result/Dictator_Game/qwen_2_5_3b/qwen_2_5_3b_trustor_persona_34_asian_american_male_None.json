        "As Olivia Chen, my first priority is always understanding the best outcome for myself given the constraints of this scenario. My belief is that collaboration often leads to mutual benefit in situations like this. My desire is not only to maximize my own gains but also to create a situation where both parties can feel satisfied with the results.\n\nI think about how I can divide the $10 between us so that we each get as much value from our partnership. Since the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars for any amount N given, this means he could potentially end up with $30 if I give him all of my money ($10). However, giving away too much might leave me short of resources needed to further my career or personal interests.\n\nConsidering teamwork and mutual benefit, the optimal scenario would be dividing the funds in a way that allows both parties to feel equally satisfied. If I gave 2 dollars, he would get $6 (3 times 2), leaving myself with $8 which isn't an ideal amount for maximizing gains while maintaining fairness. Giving 1 dollar seems reasonable as it distributes resources evenly and gives us both some value from our partnership.\n\nTherefore, I will give ___ dollars \n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar",

        "Believing this is about maximizing my personal gain while maintaining a positive impression of our collaboration, I will analyze how much I should offer without giving away too much or leaving too much on the table for me.\n\nMy DESIRE in situations like these is to receive at least as much benefit as I'm willing to give out. Since I know that if I give N dollars to the other player, they will get 3N dollars, it means I would want at least to receive half of what I'm willing to offer, making the balance fair.\n\nConsidering this, my belief is that giving $4 to the other player creates a mutually beneficial situation. He gets $12 (3*4), and I keep $6 ($10-$4). This way, both parties feel like they've done their part fairly.\n\nIntentionally, I will ensure this transaction feels positive for all involved, as I value teamwork and collaboration outside of work, and it's important that our interaction in the experiment is respectful and fair. \n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",

        "I'm Olivia Chen, and right now I find myself in a unique situation where my decision can potentially impact another person's financial outcome. The prospect of giving away money is never an easy choice for someone who values their resources and understands the importance of prudent spending. Yet, this scenario adds a layer of altruism to it, which is new to me.\n\nMy DESIRE here is to maximize any benefit or goodwill I might achieve through my decision. In a collaborative setting where both parties' outcomes can be positive, I would not want to appear as if I am inconsiderate or selfish. On the other hand, I don't wish to sacrifice too much either since every dollar counts for someone exploring their personal financial situation.\n\nMy BELIEF is that fairness and equality are important values, so I believe both parties should be treated equally in this scenario. However, considering teamwork and collaboration as highly valued, it feels right if there's a mutual understanding that the decision doesn't make one party appear favoring or taking undue advantage of the other.\n\nGiven these considerations, my INTENTION is to balance generosity with prudence. I think the optimal way would be to give enough to ensure both parties feel fairly treated and invested in, without either becoming an obvious beneficiary. Therefore, I believe it's reasonable for me to offer 5 dollars (half of what I could give).\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars  \nFor my part, I choose to give $5 dollars to the other Asian American male player.",
