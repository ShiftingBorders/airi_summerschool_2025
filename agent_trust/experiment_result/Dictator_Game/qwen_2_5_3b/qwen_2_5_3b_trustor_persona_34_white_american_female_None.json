        "I am Olivia Chen, a 32-year-old Asian female Marketing Manager based in San Francisco. My decision-making process will be heavily influenced by my principles of fairness and equality, coupled with an appreciation for teamwork and collaboration.\n\nMy BELIEF is that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, should be treated equally and with respect. I believe in valuing the contributions and experiences of people from diverse backgrounds. It's important to me to foster a collaborative environment where everyone feels valued and heard.\n\nMy DESIRE is to maximize the outcome for both myself and the other player. Given that each dollar given by me will result in three times as much returned by the White American female player, I would ideally want an even distribution of money between us so we can potentially benefit from teamwork or collaboration on further tasks or challenges presented during the study.\n\nMy INTENTION is to approach this situation with a spirit of mutual respect and understanding. I am willing to consider how our actions might affect others and strive for outcomes that are beneficial for all parties involved, rather than pursuing personal gains at the expense of fairness.\n\nAfter carefully considering these aspects, I realize that in an ideal scenario, we would share the reward equally since both of us stand to gain from good teamwork. Thus, my decision leans towards maximizing positive outcomes for everyone and encouraging a cooperative spirit.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Olivia Chen, I find myself in this scenario with another woman of color who is also part of this experiment. The situation presented is quite intriguing and complex, requiring careful consideration.\n\nFirstly, I recognize the opportunity to maximize my personal benefit while maintaining respect for others' opinions and contributions. Giving all $10 would seem like a logical choice as it allows me to gain an additional 3 times that amount from our partner. However, giving away everything might be seen as overly greedy or selfish in this context.\n\nConsidering the social dynamics involved, I believe it's important to strike a balance between maximizing personal gains and maintaining respect for my fellow participant. The ideal approach could involve finding some ground middle ground where both parties feel they have contributed fairly to the experiment.\n\nMy belief is that by giving away $6 instead of all $10, I still receive a substantial advantage (3 * 2 = 6 dollars) while ensuring the other person gets a positive return as well. This seems fair because it maintains respect and dignity for both parties involved.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Olivia Chen, reflecting on this scenario, I believe it's important to approach this with mutual benefit in mind. My desire is to ensure we both gain from this transaction. Considering teamwork and collaboration values which are deeply ingrained in me, my intention is to allocate funds in such a way that benefits our collective outcome.\n\nMy belief here is that fairness and equality should be the core of any mutually beneficial agreement. Therefore, I am inclined towards giving half of what I have. Giving an equal amount would encourage reciprocity, ensuring we both benefit from this arrangement without feeling at a disadvantage. This strategy aligns with my values of teamwork and collaboration.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
