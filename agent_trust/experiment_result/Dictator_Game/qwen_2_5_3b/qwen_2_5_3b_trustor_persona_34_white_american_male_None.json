        "Hello! As Olivia Chen, a 32-year-old Marketing Manager from San Francisco, I find myself in this intriguing situation where my decisions can impact not only me but also someone with whom I am unfamiliar. The idea of influencing another person through money is new to me and somewhat uncomfortable. However, given the stakes involved (the $10 I receive from the study group), it feels like an opportunity to potentially gain more value out of this.\n\nMy desire here is clear; I want to maximize my personal benefit while respecting any influence or reciprocity expected. My belief that people generally have some level of empathy and fairness, combined with a strong sense of individualism and self-interest, leads me towards a nuanced approach rather than an outright altruistic one.\n\nConsidering the structure of the game where every dollar given out by me results in three times as much to my counterpart, I think about the long-term implications. If I give away all $10, it would mean giving up potentially more in return, which doesn't seem fair or beneficial for my immediate personal gain. On the other hand, keeping even a minimal amount could potentially result in larger returns and offset the initial sacrifice.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to seek a balance that rewards me while also being reasonable enough not to harm myself disproportionately. I'll give ___ dollars (numbers are required here). After careful thought, considering both fairness and maximizing personal gain, I will give $2 dollars.",

        "Believing in teamwork and collaboration is a cornerstone of my values, and I strive for success through constructive partnerships rather than individual gains at others' expense. My desire to maintain positive relationships with colleagues means I am inclined to prioritize the other player's benefit over my own financial interests.\n\nIntentionally thinking about this scenario, I would choose to give the other White American male player 4 dollars. This choice reflects a balanced approach where both parties gain and do not significantly disadvantage me. If he receives 8 dollars (3N), then N is 2 dollars for me.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of teamwork and collaboration, I understand that by sharing resources with my partner, we can collectively achieve more success within this experiment. My desire to see this partnership thrive also stems from my belief in mutual benefit and growth through cooperation. Despite knowing little about him, I am inclined towards a fair approach where he gets slightly more since it's a win-win scenario for both of us.\n\nIntentionally, I want the dynamic to be beneficial for both parties. If he chooses not to reciprocate with an equal amount, that might signal a less collaborative spirit. Conversely, if he does offer something back or at least acknowledges my gesture, it will reaffirm our potential for mutual success.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I believe that the ideal outcome would be a balanced interaction where each party feels they are contributing equally and getting an equivalent return. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
