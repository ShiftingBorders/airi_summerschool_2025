        "Believing that this is not about me personally but more of an experiment to observe how people make decisions in such scenarios, I consider my actions carefully without any personal bias or influence from external factors like race or social status.\n\nMy belief here is that regardless of who the other player might be, the main goal should be a fair and balanced distribution. Giving away too much could seem unfair, but giving nothing could also feel unjust if it allows them to receive an unfairly large amount while I receive little.\n\nMy desire in this situation stems from maintaining a sense of fairness and justice, as well as wanting to explore different strategies without being overly influenced by the potential outcome's impact on our individual reputations. \n\nIntentionally, my intention is to choose a fair distribution that does not favor either side excessively, but rather aims for an equitable solution.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
