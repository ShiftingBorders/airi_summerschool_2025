        "Believing in the essence of communal living and the importance of family bonds I carry from my roots, I understand this is not just about dollars but also about trust and mutual respect among friends. Given how important it is to maintain such connections, I believe we should aim for a fair and reciprocal agreement. With all this in mind, I firmly believe that the best outcome would be if both of us receive $30 each, ensuring equal benefits.\n\nIntending to uphold these values, while also adhering to the conditions set by the experiment, my intention is clear: I want to ensure we end up with a win-win situation. Thus, aiming for balance and fairness, I will give ___ dollars\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",

        "Believing in the spirit of collaboration and mutual benefit that lies within such experiments, I recognize the potential for creating value through sharing. My desire is to ensure both parties gain from our interaction, knowing this will likely lead to positive outcomes for me as well.\n\nIntentionally, my intention is to find a middle ground where we can both achieve an outcome that benefits us collectively rather than dividing the rewards unequally. Given these considerations, I would like to propose a fair distribution strategy: if I give 6 dollars, the other player will receive 18 dollars (6*3).\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the importance of fairness and respect for others, I am always keen on maintaining positive relationships and making sure everyone involved feels valued. Given this perspective, it would not be ethical or aligned with my values to take advantage of someone else's vulnerability or misunderstanding.\n\nMy DESIRE is to ensure that both of us benefit from our interaction in a way that promotes mutual respect and cooperation. To fulfill this, I am considering the impact of taking action. Giving $10 (which means 3N = 30, thus N equals 10) would create an equal distribution where we each receive $25. This approach does not exploit the situation but rather fosters a cooperative environment.\n\nIntending to uphold these principles, my intention is clear: I want our collaboration to be beneficial for both parties and aligned with honest conduct. \n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",
