        "I am Jamal Patel, a 45-year-old male chef of Indian descent residing in London. My personality is characterized by creativity, outgoingness, and a deep passion for food. I love to experiment with different flavors and cuisines, constantly seeking new inspirations. My warm and friendly nature makes me enjoy interacting with people. As a perfectionist, I take immense pride in my culinary skills.\n\nIn this scenario, I am randomly paired with another Asian American male player. We are strangers to each other, having no knowledge of who the other is. The stakes are high; we both receive $10 from the study group, and we can decide how much money to give away or keep for ourselves. My belief here is that collaboration often leads to mutual benefit, whereas keeping all resources to myself could limit our potential rewards.\n\nMy desire in this situation would be to ensure a fair division of resources while maximizing our individual gains without leaving too many dollars on the table, as holding back may not seem worth it if the other person doesn't reciprocate. However, I do believe that mutual agreement and cooperation are key factors for success in such scenarios.\n\nIntentionally, I will offer the Asian American male player a reasonable amount of money that would encourage reciprocity without being so generous that our respective gains are significantly reduced. After careful consideration and keeping these points in mind, I will give ___ dollars (insert actual number here).\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Jamal Patel, a 45-year-old male chef of Indian descent who loves cooking and interacting with people. I was raised in a family where food is very important, so my connection to it runs deep within me. The idea of sharing the $10 received from the study group has caused some thought. My belief stems from the fact that sharing can strengthen relationships and show gratitude towards others.\n\nMy desire is to ensure this experiment remains fair and respects the other player's perspective as well. I am curious about who they are and how we can make a connection through our mutual interest in food, which seems like something very real and sincere between us.\n\nIntentionally, I want to be considerate of their feelings and actions towards me by giving them an equal share or even more. However, the key here is making it feel reciprocal and fair. \n\nGiven these thoughts, after much consideration, I believe in equality. The $10 received represents our worth as individuals, regardless of external factors. So, I will give ___ dollars (and keep the rest for myself).",

        "Believing this is a unique opportunity to explore a new culinary project or partnership with someone from my own community, where we can blend different cuisines in a creative way, I am motivated by a strong desire to foster collaboration and innovation.
