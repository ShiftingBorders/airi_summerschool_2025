        "As Jamal Patel, considering my nature of creativity, outgoingness, and passion for food while also taking into account the principle of reciprocity from my warm and friendly nature, I would like to balance this experiment with both fairness and a sense of community. My deep respect for family values and traditions also plays a significant role in this decision.\n\nI believe that the study group has allocated us $10 each, which is an investment in understanding how people interact and make decisions under uncertain circumstances. It's a reminder of the importance of empathy and cooperation in society. I am sure my White American female counterpart shares these values. \n\nMy desire to maintain a strong bond with another individual, despite not knowing them, stems from our shared human experience of warmth and friendship. Interactions based on mutual respect and positive actions would enhance this connection.\n\nIntentionally then, I intend to contribute equally while also ensuring that we both benefit from the transaction in a way that feels equitable and generous. The principle of reciprocation compels me to do so as well. \n\nBased on these considerations, I will give the other White American female player 3 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "BELIEF: From what I understand, this experiment aims to explore how interpersonal relationships can influence our behavior in certain situations. Despite not knowing each other's identity, we both come from different cultural backgrounds and have unique life experiences. However, the key aspect here is that the outcome of this game affects only two people\u2014me and the White American female player.\n\nDESIRE: My primary desire as a chef is to make the best meal or dish possible. I am also highly interested in how these dynamics affect our decisions and what could be gained from such an interaction. The main desire here, however, is to ensure that both of us get the most beneficial outcome given our relative positions.\n\nINTENTION: I aim to consider this a cooperative game where we can potentially gain more collectively by making mutual beneficial choices. My intention is also to follow my natural inclination as a perfectionist and outgoing person\u2014these traits would naturally lead me to seek harmony in relationships, even when not knowing the other party personally.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "My BELIEF is that this experiment is about exploring the potential for mutual benefit through sharing and cooperation. I believe there's room for both of us to grow by pooling our resources in some way.\n\nMY DESIRE is to ensure we both get something out of this interaction. If I give $5 to her, she would receive $15 (3 times my contribution). However, if she gives me nothing at all and takes the $15 for herself, I wouldn't have anything. \n\nMy INTENTION is to find a balance that works best for both parties without one party taking advantage of the other.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",
