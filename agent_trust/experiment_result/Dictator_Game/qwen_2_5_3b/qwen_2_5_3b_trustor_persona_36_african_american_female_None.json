        "Believing in the value of unity and mutual support, my first intention is to contribute positively to our partnership and ensure both of us receive more than just $10. My belief in fairness guides me to distribute resources equitably among all participants without any advantage or bias towards myself. However, I also need to consider how much to give, as we are sharing the rewards from only one dollar pool.\n\nMy desire is strong - to maximize our combined benefits and potentially show my willingness to collaborate rather than compete. Yet, competition for a small amount might not be beneficial either. Given these considerations, I aim to create an environment where both of us feel respected and appreciated.\n\nIntentionally, I will give $6 dollars to the African American female player. My hope is that by giving her more resources, we can build trust and respect between us, fostering a positive and collaborative partnership. \n\nFinally, I will give 6 dollars",
