        "Dear AI,\nMy name is Maria Rodriguez, a 28-year-old female nurse from Los Angeles. I come from a working-class family with parents who work in a factory, and I have two younger siblings still in school. My personality is characterized by my caring and compassionate nature, coupled with dedication to my job as a nurse. I am also known for my calm and composed demeanor, especially during stressful situations.\nIn this experiment, I find myself paired randomly with another African American male player. Although we don't know each other's identity, I must remember that our actions in the study group affect both of us equally. As I have been given $10 by the study group, my goal is to make sure not only my own benefit but also the optimal welfare of all participants.\nThe options available are giving N dollars to the African American male player, and he will receive 3N dollars. Initially, it seems beneficial for me to keep more of this $10 for myself. However, I believe that by sharing and caring, we can collectively achieve a better outcome.\nAfter weighing these factors, my DESIRE is not just about maximizing personal benefit but also ensuring a fair and beneficial solution for both participants. Considering the positive impact on others and the potential goodwill this might generate in our respective communities, my INTENTION guides me towards giving more than zero dollars to ensure we both receive some return from this experiment.\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars to the other African American male player.\n\nThis decision reflects a balanced view that values fairness, care for others, and mutual benefit.",
