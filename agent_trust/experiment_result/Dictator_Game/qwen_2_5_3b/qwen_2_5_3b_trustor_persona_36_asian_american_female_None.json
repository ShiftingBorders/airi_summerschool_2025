        "Firstly, let's consider my belief about this situation. The $10 I receive from the study group can only be used to affect how much money I give to the other participant. If I don't give anything, then she receives nothing; if I give her more than 0 dollars, I might hope that she'll reciprocate in a way that ensures we both get more benefit from this interaction. However, since there are no negative consequences for giving or withholding money in this experiment, my primary focus should be on maximizing our shared benefit.\n\nMy desire is to see if the other participant will reciprocate because I believe reciprocity could maximize mutual gains and ensure fairness. However, I also consider that the true aim of such an interaction might not be just about individual benefits but about understanding each other better or achieving a more collaborative result in some future context. It's important for me to remain composed and focused on what benefits us both.\n\nMy intention is to act ethically by maximizing mutual benefit while maintaining trust and respect for my partner. I aim to find an amount that isn't so generous as to make giving it seem like a token gesture, but also not too minimalistic or uncooperative. Finding a balance where both parties feel they are contributing equally without feeling exploited.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "My belief is that this experiment is about understanding how people make decisions when they don't know who they're interacting with. My desire in such situations is to act ethically and fairly because it's important for me to maintain trust and respect in my professional life. My intention, therefore, will be to ensure a fair outcome where both of us benefit equally.\n\nConsidering the distribution of money as per the options given - giving away $10 means the other player gets 30 dollars while I receive 3 dollars; or giving away $5 means each person gets 15 dollars. \n\nI don't want this experiment to set a negative precedent where one party feels exploited, which is something that would reflect poorly on me as a nurse and person of integrity. At the same time, my goal isn't to maximize personal benefit but rather contribute to an environment conducive for both parties.\n\nGiven all these factors, I believe the most ethical choice here would be to give $5 to the other Asian American female player so we each get 15 dollars. This way, everyone benefits and it's a fair outcome without any potential for misinterpretation or unfairness on either part.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "Firstly, let's address my BELIEF about this situation: As Maria Rodriguez, I firmly believe in fairness and maintaining trust within relationships. This experiment suggests we should be working towards mutual benefit rather than seeking personal gain at each other's expense. Trust is crucial for any professional or personal relationship, so I am inclined to act accordingly.\n\nNext, considering my DESIRE: My primary desire as a nurse is to help others and maintain the dignity of those involved in this study. It would be ethically appropriate to reciprocate if possible without risking any imbalance that could lead to suspicion or distrust among participants.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to create an environment where both myself and the other participant feel respected and valued. My intention is to give enough back but not so much that it could cause resentment.\n\nHaving considered these factors, my final decision would be: Finally, I will give $3 dollars.",
