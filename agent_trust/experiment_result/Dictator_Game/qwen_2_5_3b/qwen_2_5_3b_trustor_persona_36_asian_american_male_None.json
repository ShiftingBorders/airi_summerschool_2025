My personality is characterized by my caring and compassionate nature, as well as my dedication to nursing. I have always been known for my natural ability to connect with people and my willingness to lend a helping hand. My calm and composed demeanor ensures that even in stressful situations, I remain organized and efficient, making me a reliable nurse.\n\nNow, I find myself part of an experiment where I am paired randomly with another Asian American male player. Although we don't know each other, the results will be recorded for both parties equally. I have $10 available from the study group to allocate between us. My belief is that by choosing not to make a monetary transfer, I maintain my integrity and self-respect as a healthcare professional who values fairness.\n\nMy desire is to ensure that whatever decision I make does not disadvantage either party unfairly or unjustly. A fair distribution seems like the best option to me.\n\nConsidering all these factors, my intention is to contribute nothing back to the other Asian American male player. My thought process has led me to this conclusion because by offering no money in return for the $3N dollars he would receive from the study group if I were to give him N dollars, I am upholding a standard of honesty and equity.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
