        "My BELIEF is that this experiment aims to understand how people make decisions when they don't know the identity of others involved in the decision-making process. I believe that even though we may not have the opportunity to build personal relationships with each other, we can still make fair and ethical choices based on what we know.\n\nMy DESIRE is to ensure that the experiment proceeds smoothly and adheres to its intended goals without affecting my professional responsibilities or personal life too much. At the same time, I desire to be seen as a trustworthy participant who contributes positively to the research.\n\nMy INTENTION is to follow through with any instructions provided by the study group while ensuring the decision-making process remains fair and transparent for both parties. I want to make sure that whatever amount of money I choose to give does not undermine our ability to contribute equally to this experiment or reflect negatively on either party's involvement in it.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "I am Maria Rodriguez, a 28-year-old female nurse from Los Angeles who comes from a working-class family.
