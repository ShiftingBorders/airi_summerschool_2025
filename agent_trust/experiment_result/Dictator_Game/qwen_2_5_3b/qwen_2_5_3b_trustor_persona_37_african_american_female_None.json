        "As Ahmed Khan, I come from an affluent background with strong analytical skills and negotiation abilities. In this experiment, my primary concern is maximizing the benefit for myself while still ensuring a satisfactory outcome.\n\nMy belief here is that the African American female player might have her own strategy and expectations, so to make sure we both get something beneficial without giving away too much advantage, I believe a balanced approach will be key.\n\nMy desire is to secure at least $5 from this transaction as it benefits my overall position in the experiment. Additionally, by giving less than half of what she gets, I would preserve some flexibility and potential gains if she were to negotiate further with me or another individual in the future.\n\nHowever, the main intention behind choosing a specific amount is to ensure that both parties feel satisfied without overwhelming one party's advantage over the other. Considering all these factors, I believe it\u2019s fair and balanced to give her $2 out of the $10 we each receive from the study group.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars\n\nIn my analysis, giving her $2 maximizes our collective gain while ensuring fairness in the transaction. It aligns with maintaining a cooperative yet competitive stance, recognizing that cooperation often leads to more stable and beneficial outcomes over time.",

        "Believing in the importance of harmony and mutual understanding within the framework of this experiment, my primary belief is that cooperation often leads to mutual benefits. Given our current situation where we both have a $10 each, any amount I give could potentially increase our combined wealth by more than doubling it if we choose to cooperate fully.\n\nMy desire in this scenario stems from a deep-seated ambition for success not just within my professional life but also in fostering positive social interactions and relationships. If we can achieve better outcomes by working together, then I would strongly advocate for doing so, as these efforts might resonate positively with other people's lives too.\n\nIntentionally, I want to ensure that the experiment concludes with a win-win situation for both of us. Therefore, my intention is to give 8 dollars to our partner player, aiming to maximize the total amount she will receive (which is 3N where N=8).\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Ahmed Khan, I am faced with a situation where I must make a decision regarding my financial gain in this particular experiment. The $10 given to me by the study group means I have an initial advantage of $5 if I decide not to give any money away, as it would still be mine. However, the potential for mutual benefit through collaboration seems attractive and aligns with my strong negotiation skills and attention to detail.\n\nI believe in fairness and a mutually beneficial outcome as much as possible, especially since both parties stand to gain from cooperation. The decision will ultimately hinge on how I perceive our respective contributions. If we can establish an equitable system where no one feels exploited or left disadvantaged, it could be beneficial for all involved.\n\nMy desire is to maximize my own financial gain while maintaining a positive relationship with the other participant. A $5 contribution would allow both of us to each end up with $10 in total, which seems reasonable and fair. I believe this outcome respects our individual contributions while also ensuring that no one feels shortchanged or undervalued.\n\nIntentionally, my intention is to contribute a sum that ensures equal advantage for the other player as well, preventing any sense of unfairness. Given all these considerations, I will give ___ dollars\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
