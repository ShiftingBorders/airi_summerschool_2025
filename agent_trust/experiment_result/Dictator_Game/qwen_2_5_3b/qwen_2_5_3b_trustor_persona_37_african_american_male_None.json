        "BELIEF:\nI believe that cooperation is often more beneficial than confrontation, especially in professional settings where mutual success is crucial for everyone involved. However, I am also aware of the power dynamics at play here. If we can both maximize our individual benefits, it might be mutually advantageous to give a significant portion away.\n\nDESIRE:\nMy desire is to ensure that my contribution adds value and not cost me financially in this experiment. It would be wise to find out more about my partner's position or status, so I can gauge how much they are willing to give back. This way, we could reach an equitable agreement.\n\nINTENTION:\nI intend to observe carefully and analyze the other player\u2019s behavior before deciding on a strategy. Once I understand their financial situation and priorities, I will propose a fair deal that ensures both of our success in this study.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am a 38-year-old lawyer from Dubai with an affluent background. My family consists of a successful businessman father and a homemaker mother. Currently, I reside in Dubai. Professionally, I'm known for my strong negotiation skills and attention to detail, making me quite well-known in my field. I strive for success both personally and professionally.\n\nIn this experiment, I have just been paired with another African American male player who I do not know. The stakes are significant - we can either split $10 between us by giving a certain amount to the other individual, with them receiving three times what I give. It's clear that if I keep all of my share for myself, I will receive nothing in total since the other person will receive more.\n\n**Belief**: This experiment suggests that even though we are strangers and not on any team or work together, there is a sense of fairness and mutual benefit when it comes to sharing. If both parties play rationally, we should each keep half of our $10 for ourselves as maximizing the overall profit would mean splitting the money equally.\n\n**Desire**: My desire here lies in seeing how I can leverage this situation for personal gain while also being fair. I am analytical and value negotiation skills, so I understand that there are potential strategies to employ here. However, my primary motivation is to ensure we both maximize our returns based on rational behavior.\n\n**Intention**: With these considerations in mind, my intention is to find the optimal distribution of money between us while ensuring that neither party feels exploited or disadvantaged. Ideally, I want to see this scenario as a win-win situation where everyone's share benefits from increased cooperation and fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 to the other African American male player.",

        "I come from an affluent family with a successful father and homemaker mother, and I am known for my strong negotiation skills and attention to detail in law. My younger sister is pursuing medicine, and I strive for success in my career. These qualities have made me well-respected among my peers.\n\nIn this experiment, I need to consider both rational and emotional aspects of the situation. I believe that in such a cooperative scenario where we are both trying to maximize our individual benefits while maintaining fairness, it is important to establish trust and maintain an equitable outcome.\n\nMy desire here is for a balance where we can each get a fair amount without causing conflict or feeling like one partner benefited at another's expense. It would be ideal if the distribution reflected this balanced cooperation.\n\nBased on these considerations, I think logically that splitting $10 equally would not provide much to either of us individually, but it also seems too generous given the structure of the deal: he gets 3 times what I get. Therefore, a more nuanced approach is needed.\n\nMy intention is to ensure we both feel like our interests are considered and fairly balanced. A split where I give slightly less than half would be a practical way to achieve this; perhaps around $4 or $5 given to him, meaning he gets the remaining $6 or $7 back, aligning with his payout but still making a modest contribution to ensure everyone feels like they're participating in mutual gain.\n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",
