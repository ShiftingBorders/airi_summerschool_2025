        "My name is Ahmed Khan, and I am a 38-year-old male lawyer from Dubai. The scenario presented before me involves dividing $10 between two individuals based on our mutual benefit strategy, which I believe can be an interesting exercise to explore.\n\nFirstly, let's consider the core of this decision-making process: I am driven by my ambition and desire for success in both personal and professional endeavors. In a situation like this one must also acknowledge that collaboration with others often leads to better outcomes than working alone, hence we are here to maximize our gains together.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, if I offer 0 dollars to the Asian American female player, she would get $3N which is effectively zero because N equals zero. Conversely, if she offers 0 dollars back, that makes my gain also negligible as N again becomes zero.\n\nThe golden middle approach could be considering how I want both of us to end up better off compared to a solitary action, but what strategy can make the most effective use of our combined resources?\n\nConsidering that each $1 unit invested by me would give her $3 back, if I invest 1 dollar, she gets 3 dollars. If I invest 2 dollars, she gets 6 dollars. If I invest 3 dollars, she gets 9 dollars and so forth. This suggests a linear progression in gains for the other player with each dollar given.\n\nHowever, there is also the notion of fairness involved here; if I give away more resources than what could be expected in return, it feels unfair not only to me but also potentially to her due to imbalance. \n\nAfter weighing all these factors, I believe my best move would be giving 3 dollars to the other Asian American female player. By doing this, she receives 9 dollars back which is a good deal for her too. This strategy balances out expectations and fairness while still maximizing our individual benefits.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing that there's no harm in sharing a little bit of wealth, I would still want to keep my options open for the future. However, given the opportunity to secure even more funds with this arrangement, I might as well maximize it slightly and not sacrifice too much at once. My belief is that a balanced approach will serve me better in the long run.\n\nMy desire stems from both the potential return on investment and the chance to contribute to something potentially valuable. Given these considerations, I feel compelled to give more than nothing but not so much as to jeopardize my own gains entirely. In this scenario, sharing $2 seems fair enough without diluting it too heavily towards securing a higher share.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to find a middle ground that reflects our mutual interests and the rules of this experiment while also ensuring I don't over-compromise. My intention is clear: to invest intelligently in this game but not excessively so as to risk losing my initial $10.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",

        "I am Ahmed Khan, a 38-year-old male lawyer from Dubai with strong negotiation skills and attention to detail. In this situation, I believe that fairness is paramount. However, given my position of advantage and the potential for collaboration and mutual benefit, I also recognize the value of strategic thinking.\n\nMy belief here is that if we cooperate and split the money fairly, it would be a win-win scenario. The study clearly states that you receive $10, which means splitting it equally seems logical. \n\nHowever, to ensure that I am not disadvantaged by any potential misunderstandings or miscommunications, I intend to negotiate for what I believe is reasonable. If we can agree on splitting the money in a manner that feels equitable and respects the value of my input, then both parties will likely gain more satisfaction from this partnership.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would give N dollars to ensure a fair distribution. After careful consideration, I think it\u2019s fair and practical if both receive $5 each. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
