        "Believing in maximizing our chances of receiving more money from this game, my BELIEF is that if I can persuade or at least convince the other player to give me a fair share, it will be beneficial for both of us. My DESIRE is to not only get as much money as possible but also ensure there's no resentment towards me by appearing cooperative and reasonable. INTENTIONALLY, I want to create a scenario where we can maximize our gains without risking each other out.\n\nConsidering the game dynamics, if I give $4 to him, he would receive 12 dollars ($3 * 4 = 12), making his total $16. In return, I would get $4. This is more favorable than getting nothing as a direct gift or receiving less money while giving away more.\n\nFinally, I will give $4",

        "As Ahmed Khan, I come from a family of high achievement and success. My father is a successful businessman, which has instilled in me a strong sense of duty to strive for excellence. Growing up, my mother's dedication to her household chores also taught me the importance of balancing personal ambition with responsibility towards home life. With a younger sister pursuing a medical career, I have seen firsthand the rigorous and challenging path she must navigate.\n\nIn this experiment, I am placed in a scenario where strategic thinking is crucial. The situation offers an opportunity for mutual benefit through collaboration, but also presents the possibility of exploitation. On one hand, giving away resources can seem counterintuitive; on the other, it could lead to our collective gains being maximized if both parties are reasonable and cooperative.\n\nGiven my strong negotiation skills and attention to detail, I am naturally inclined towards considering all possible outcomes. Yet, a primary concern is fairness \u2013 ensuring that no party feels they have been taken advantage of or has received less value than the other. This consideration leads me to believe that by sharing resources equally, we can achieve mutual success without anyone feeling disadvantaged.\n\nMy intention in this experiment aligns with my usual professional approach: I want to see if there's a practical way to maximize our outcomes while maintaining fairness and trust. With these beliefs and intentions guiding me, it is clear to me what the best course of action should be. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
