        "As Ahmed Khan, I stand confident in my analytical skills and experience, knowing that every decision in this negotiation could impact our potential payout significantly. My belief is that there's value in building a positive rapport with my counterpart, even if we don't know each other\u2019s identities. It\u2019s important to maintain composure and show an open-minded approach to ensure I come across as a fair and cooperative partner.\n\nMy desire is strong\u2014winning this experiment would not only benefit me financially but also highlight my negotiation prowess to the researchers. However, I want to make sure we both walk away with something worth our efforts. I am drawn to the idea of creating an equitable partnership where both parties can gain from the deal, maximizing our combined winnings.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to offer a generous amount that reflects this belief in cooperation and fair play. This strategy could lead us towards mutual gains, increasing the overall payout. By offering 3 dollars, it\u2019s reasonable and would allow me to keep about $6 for myself, while my partner gets $9. In doing so, we both achieve more substantial rewards together.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Believing in the principle of mutual benefit and understanding that our goal is to maximize rewards within the study's constraints, I would analyze the scenario from every possible perspective before making my decision. As Ahmed Khan, an assertive and analytical lawyer who values success and efficiency, I am inclined towards maximizing gains without risking a loss for myself.\n\nConsidering the given conditions: \n- I receive $10 from the study group.\n- If I give N dollars to the White American female player, she will get 3N dollars.\n\nI start by giving some thought to what might happen if I choose not to share. The most immediate consequence is that I retain my entire $10 for myself without any additional reward. However, since this scenario doesn't account for her potential response or her maximizing the rewards given to herself, it's likely she would give me an equal or even greater amount, effectively negating my gains.\n\nGiven the complexity and necessity of mutual benefit in such scenarios, I decide to explore the middle ground where both parties can see immediate benefits. By choosing a fair share that does not jeopardize our individual returns while ensuring reciprocity is rewarded, I am aligning with a cooperative strategy which has proven successful in similar negotiation settings.\n\nHence, after careful consideration of potential outcomes and strategic interests, I will give the White American female player $4 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars 4",

        "I am Ahmed Khan, a 38-year-old male lawyer from Dubai who comes from an affluent family with a successful businessman father and a homemaker mother. I have one younger sister studying medicine at university. As a person, I am confident, assertive, and highly analytical. My strong negotiation skills and attention to detail make me well-known in my field. People often seek my expertise and leadership abilities; as someone ambitious and driven, I strive for success in my career.\n\nIn this experiment, I have been paired with another White American female player, whom I do not know and she doesn't know me either. We will each receive $10 from the study group, and we can distribute it based on a mutual agreement: you give N dollars to her, and she receives 3N dollars.\n\nBelieving that both parties benefit equally from this arrangement would be most strategic. In fact, giving zero dollars is not advantageous because even if I don't contribute, she will receive $30 (my contribution plus the initial $10). The fairest split, which maximizes mutual benefit and aligns with a win-win strategy, is to give her exactly half of what she would receive from me. Therefore, if you gave 5 dollars, I'd get 15 (N) and she would receive 3*5 = 15.\n\nConsidering this, my belief that both parties should equally benefit motivates the intention to contribute fairly and deliberately. My desire for success in negotiations guides me towards making an even split of what we have at stake: $10 each.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
