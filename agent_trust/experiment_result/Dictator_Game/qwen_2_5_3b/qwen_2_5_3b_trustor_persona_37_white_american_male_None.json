        "My name is Ahmed Khan, a 38-year-old male lawyer from Dubai, living in a society where I am respected for my analytical skills and leadership abilities. My background gives me a strong belief in fairness and mutual benefit within any arrangement, as it aligns with the principles of both Islamic jurisprudence and modern business ethics.\n\nGiven our situation here, I firmly believe that to maximize the overall value created, which benefits not just one but two individuals, a cooperative approach should be adopted. My desire is to ensure that we both come out winners from this arrangement, thus creating a positive outcome for ourselves and contributing positively to the study's goals of understanding human behavior in social dilemmas.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, I intend to demonstrate my commitment to fairness by ensuring that any value I share will lead to an equitable distribution. With this in mind, after careful consideration, I decide to give half of what is available to me. This way, we both end up with the same amount while maximizing personal benefit.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "As Ahmed Khan, considering my strong analytical skills and desire for success within my career, I recognize that this negotiation is not only about financial gain but also about influence and reputation in professional circles. Given that I come from an affluent background, I understand the importance of strategic alliances.\n\nI believe that investing a significant amount of money could create a psychological advantage or establish a strong relationship with the other player, potentially opening doors for future collaborations or business opportunities. On the other hand, giving away too much might weaken this alliance or leave me in a weaker position if things do not work out as planned.\n\nMy desire to succeed and my analytical approach suggests that I should focus on finding an equilibrium where both parties feel they have gained something valuable from the arrangement. However, given my history of assertiveness and strategic thinking, I believe giving more money would be beneficial, as it could lead to a mutually beneficial partnership down the line.\n\nI intend to use this opportunity not just for financial gain but also to establish credibility and influence within any professional network that we might develop in the future. \n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",

        "Dear participant,\n\nI'm here participating in this experiment, and I understand the rules clearly. The $10 from the study group will be split between me and another White American male player. My belief is that cooperation can lead to mutual benefits in such scenarios, where both parties might achieve a higher outcome than if we compete.\n\nMy desire is strong, but it's essential for success to maintain trust and fair play. I believe fairness and honesty are crucial in any situation, including this experiment. Therefore, my intention is to ensure that the White American male player feels respected and valued.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe giving a significant portion of the money would be beneficial for mutual prosperity. Considering the $10 we each received from the study group, if I give half ($5) to the other participant, he will receive 3N dollars, which equals $15, making his total $20.\n\nThus, my final decision is based on these principles of mutual benefit and fairness. So, I will give ___ dollars (the answer being 5).",
