        "Believing in the importance of creating a more inclusive and diverse fashion industry where everyone feels valued regardless of their background or identity is deeply ingrained in my beliefs. Inclusivity isn't just about who dresses how; it's also about representation and making every individual feel seen and heard. My desire, therefore, lies not only in achieving success for myself but also ensuring that the industry I'm a part of recognizes these values and makes an impact.\n\nGiven this perspective, the amount of money I choose to give is driven by my intention to demonstrate a commitment to sharing resources in such a way that benefits the entire community. By investing N dollars into fostering diversity within fashion, we can not only make spaces more vibrant and appealing but also inspire future generations to see their own cultures reflected and celebrated.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the principles of inclusivity and diversity I am passionate about promoting within the fashion industry, my first instinct is to ensure fairness and equality in our interaction with this other player. While I would not want any money exchanged if it feels unfair or manipulative, as someone who values equal opportunities, I believe a small token of goodwill could enhance the experience for both of us.\n\nConsidering the importance of respect and mutual understanding within such an experiment aimed at exploring different perspectives, my intention is to contribute in a way that reflects these principles. However, I do not feel compelled to give away significant amounts of money without understanding her background or role more clearly. \n\nSo with this thought process, and keeping in mind the need for balance and respect, I will give 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
