        "I am Mei Ling, a fashion designer from Tokyo who is deeply passionate about promoting diversity and inclusivity in the fashion world. My background is quite different from that of the African American male player whom I don't know. However, let me reflect on this situation: If I were to give money to the other African American male player as part of this experiment, it would likely be influenced by a mix of social values and personal beliefs rooted in my passion for diversity and inclusivity.\n\nMy belief is that we should all have an equal chance at opportunities, regardless of our backgrounds or origins. Giving more than just what is required to the other participant would seem counterintuitive as I want them to also benefit from this experiment without feeling exploited. At the same time, ensuring they receive a fair amount aligns with my desire for fairness and equity in any arrangement.\n\nIntentionally, however, if I wanted to maximize our shared outcome and feel like we are truly working towards something greater than just the money exchanged, I would ensure both of us benefit appropriately. \n\nConsidering these points, although it's clear that my intention is to support their success without making it seem exploitative, I would still aim for a balance where both parties can gain fairly.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I am Mei Ling, with my unique blend of creativity, fashion insight, and passion for inclusivity in the industry guiding me through this experiment. My belief is that collaboration can be mutually beneficial when we come from diverse backgrounds. It's important to recognize our shared humanity and strive for mutual success rather than competition.\n\nMy desire for this experiment lies in fostering a positive environment where individuals of different backgrounds can work together towards a common goal of promoting diversity and inclusivity in fashion. I also want to see if such an interaction can lead to mutual understanding and respect, which are valuable outcomes beyond just the financial transaction we're participating in.\n\nIntentionally considering the impact our actions could have on each other, I aim to create a positive experience that demonstrates unity rather than division. I value maintaining trust and ensuring fairness in this exchange.\n\nTaking all these into account, I will give $2 dollars",

        "Believing in the experiment's rules, I analyze the situation where I can maximize my personal benefit or achieve mutual benefits with my partner. My belief is that there is a chance for both of us to gain more than just our individual $10 if we collaborate and divide our winnings wisely.\n\nMy desire is strong; I want to ensure that I receive as much value from this experiment as possible, not only based on the monetary terms but also because it's my nature to find creative solutions. However, my primary concern should be ensuring fairness in the outcome for both of us. \n\nIntentionally, I am looking at how we can balance our gain while maintaining a positive interaction and rapport. My intention is to ensure that if either of us receives $10 without contributing any money (N=0), it would be unfair as it doesn't involve mutual participation.\n\nConsidering these points, my belief is that there's significant value in a fair sharing strategy rather than an unequal one. If I contribute some amount N to the other African American male player, he will receive 3N. Let\u2019s calculate potential values if I give N = $5:\n- If I give N = $5 to him, he would receive 3N = $15.\n- My partner giving me back his contribution means receiving no further benefit from our arrangement.\n\nIf we both decide to collaborate in this manner, each of us will end up with a total value. For instance, if I gave N = $5:\n- He gets $15 and I keep the remaining balance that benefits me without him having any gain.\n- Since he now holds no further benefit from my money contribution (if we both contribute equally or even unevenly).\n\nI conclude that dividing equitably between us is best to ensure fairness. Giving N=2 to my partner:\n- He receives 3N = $6, and I end up with a balance of $4.\n- It seems more equitable as he has gained but still appreciates our collaboration.\n\nGiven these calculations and the need for an equally beneficial outcome, I will give ___ dollars (in this scenario, I choose to give N=2) Finally, I will give 2 dollars",
