        "Firstly, let's break down my decision-making process. My belief is rooted in fairness and the importance of not giving all the money away as it would leave me with nothing to contribute to the experiment. Secondly, my desire is for maximum personal benefit without jeopardizing any long-term positive impact I might have on society through fashion. Lastly, my intention is to ensure both parties receive something meaningful from this interaction while also being mindful of equal distribution.\n\nConsidering these points, my first inclination would be to give away a portion that reflects mutual benefit but prevents leaving one party with an unmanageable sum. Since the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars for every N dollars I give, intuitively giving away half or even more might not seem fair given what she could potentially return.\n\nI believe in balancing generosity and protection of resources for potential future returns. If I keep too much, it risks me getting nothing back; if I give away too much, the other player gets a disproportionate advantage over me. Therefore, dividing the money equally seems like the fairest option that also ensures both sides are not left impoverished.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "BELIEF: The game seems to be structured in such a way that one can maximize personal benefit by maximizing the benefits of my partner, creating a win-win situation where both parties receive more than nothing without any loss for myself. However, I'm also aware that this outcome is unlikely since it's a competitive setup. If I give away too much money, I risk being taken advantage of, and if I keep most for myself, the other player might not want to cooperate at all.\n\nDESIRE: My primary desire in this situation is to receive as many dollars as possible while ensuring that my partner isn't incentivized to exploit me or avoid cooperating. Given that both parties benefit from a fair exchange where they don't lose out by contributing to each other's gains, I aim for a middle-ground strategy.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is straightforward \u2013 I wish to ensure a win-win scenario where we both maximize the benefits of our cooperation. To achieve this, I will give enough so that my partner feels compelled to reciprocate in kind, but not so much that it undermines their incentive to help me.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
