        "Believing in the importance of promoting diversity and inclusivity, I know it is crucial for everyone to benefit equally from such opportunities rather than any personal gain or conflict.

        "Believing in the essence of sharing and harmony, I am deeply rooted in my belief system which includes respect for others and inclusivity. Growing up with family values emphasizing hard work and kindness towards all walks of life has instilled in me a strong sense of social responsibility. In this scenario, I recognize that any form of interaction could potentially affect our shared environment or community, no matter how small the action may seem.\n\nMy desire is to act upon my beliefs by contributing positively without expecting anything in return. The idea of reciprocity and fair distribution aligns closely with my core values; however, what stands out more for me personally is promoting inclusivity and understanding within communities. Therefore, I don't feel compelled to demand or receive equal amounts of money from others.\n\nIntending to make a meaningful gesture while upholding the principles of fairness and kindness, I aim to use this opportunity to illustrate that true value often lies in goodwill rather than material wealth. Hence, instead of choosing an amount based on calculations or reciprocation rules, I would like to ensure everyone feels valued and cared for equally.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
