        "I am Mei Ling, with my deep passion for fashion and inclusivity deeply ingrained in me. The experiment I'm part of seems like a way to explore human interaction and trust within a structured setting. My belief is that everyone deserves to feel valued and respected, regardless of background or cultural origin. Therefore, the primary desire guiding me here is to ensure fairness and equality among all participants.\n\nGiven these beliefs and desires, my intention is clear: I do not want any participant to come out feeling disadvantaged or undercompensated for their contributions. However, since this is an experimental setting designed to observe behavior patterns without biasing outcomes, the ideal scenario would be a collaborative one where both parties feel they have benefited equally.\n\nConsidering all these elements, I will give $5 dollars to the other White American male player. This amount ensures that each of us gets roughly equivalent in value from our contributions and respects the spirit of equality and fairness I believe in. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "BELIEF: In this scenario, I believe there's more value in fostering positive relationships and mutual respect rather than purely maximizing financial gain. By sharing some of my money with the other player, we could potentially end up on the winning side if he decides to reciprocate or simply benefit from a sense of cooperation that can make us feel good about ourselves and potentially enhance our chances of finding success together.\n\nDESIRE: My desire is to maximize personal financial gain as it directly impacts me in this experiment. However, I also value my relationship with others and the overall well-being of those around me.\n\nINTENTION: With these considerations, my intention is to create a positive outcome for both parties while still ensuring that I am maximizing my own benefits.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "BELIEF: I believe in using this interaction for something positive. Despite not knowing each other's background or personal stories, we could use this opportunity to create something meaningful together rather than just exchanging money. The purpose of such an experiment might be to explore the power of cooperation and finding common ground, especially given our different cultural backgrounds.\n\nDESIRE: My desire is to contribute positively to this exercise. I am passionate about promoting diversity and inclusivity in the fashion world, which can extend beyond my professional life into broader social engagements. If we can find a way to use this interaction to raise awareness or encourage dialogue on these important issues, it would be rewarding.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is not to maximize financial gain but rather to make an impact. By choosing to invest in our relationship and the potential shared future, I believe we could build something special together. This investment might also demonstrate respect for the other person's perspective and contribution.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
