        "Firstly, I believe this is a situation where mutual benefit lies at its core. Given my belief in collaboration and teamwork, I also firmly hold the view that fair play should be maintained among all parties involved.\n\nMy desire here is to ensure both of us receive as much money as possible without any loss, and ideally, we could split it equally since we each contribute N dollars. However, the most efficient way would be for both of us to give 0 dollars to the other player, which will result in a total payout of $20, with each of us receiving $10.\n\nMy intention is to find the optimal solution that benefits both parties without any loss and adheres to fair play principles. By giving nothing to the other African American male player, we ensure neither party feels disadvantaged nor left out. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I'm Sarah Johnson, an African American software engineer from New York City. I understand that I will receive $10 from the study group. My goal here is to make sure both of us benefit equally since we're on opposite sides of this scenario.\n\nBelief: In my belief, fairness and equality are important values. The experiment aims at understanding behavior and interaction between African Americans in certain settings, so I should ensure that any actions taken will not create a sense of imbalance or favoritism.\n\nDesire: My desire is to maximize the benefit for both parties involved. Since I know I'll receive $10, my objective here is to decide how much to share with the other player, which would be fair and beneficial in this context.\n\nIntention: My intention is clear - I want to ensure that by giving some of what I have received, we both benefit equally. If I were to give zero or all ten dollars to myself, it wouldn't lead to a win-win situation where each of us ends up with more than if I kept the entire amount.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Sarah Johnson, a software engineer from New York City, with a strong belief in fairness and equality. I am driven by my desire for both personal and professional success, which includes contributing to this study's outcomes responsibly. My intention is to maintain a cooperative atmosphere that could potentially benefit all parties involved.\n\nFirstly, it's essential for me to consider the economic impact of my decision. If I give $N to the other African American male player, he will receive 3N dollars. Let's analyze different scenarios:\n\n1. Giving $0: He gets 0, and I get 0.\n2. Giving $5: He gets $15, and I get $5.\n3. Giving more than $5: The division of money favors him, which could undermine trust in the experiment.\n\nGiven my strong belief in fairness and equality, the most balanced option would be to give half of what I have. This ensures an equal value is given regardless of how much was received by the other player, thus maintaining a fair environment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
