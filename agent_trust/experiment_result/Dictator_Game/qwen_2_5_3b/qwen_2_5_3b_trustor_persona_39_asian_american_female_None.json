        "Firstly, let's consider my situation. My belief is based on rational thinking and fairness in such economic scenarios. I desire the best outcome for both of us and intend to act accordingly. \n\nMy intention is to maximize the overall value we derive from this transaction while ensuring that neither party feels disadvantaged or wronged. \n\nThe scenario suggests a 3:1 profit split, meaning if one player gives out $N, the other gets 3N. Given the study's objective of finding an optimal balance and considering fairness, I would aim to keep the disparity minimal.\n\nIf I give away zero dollars ($0), our net gain per player is effectively nil since they get a return based on my contribution, meaning we end up with $10 (the total amount from the group) split such that one person gets nothing in terms of additional financial benefit while the other gains $3N. However, this seems inequitable as both should not feel like losers.\n\nOn the flip side, if I were to give all my money away ($10), the other player would have an unlimited 3:1 advantage which is also undesirable since it feels exploitative and might lead to distrust in future interactions.\n\nConsidering these factors, a logical middle-ground solution could be to distribute our resources evenly. This way, we both receive $5 each\u2014me receiving the original $10 and you getting another $5. \n\nThis approach balances our benefits equally while still allowing for an efficient exchange that neither feels undercompensated for. In turn, I will give ___ dollars: Finally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Believing this experiment is about understanding social dynamics and maximizing mutual benefit through collaboration, I consider the best strategy to ensure both of us receive more money despite not knowing each other's true intentions. My desire here is clear - I want to maximize our collective earnings from this study.\n\nIntending to demonstrate a cooperative spirit that could lead to even greater rewards in future collaborations or personal relationships, my intention dictates that I will offer the Asian American female player the maximum amount I'm allowed to give without risking too much of my own money. \n\nConsidering the optimal outcome would be if both parties agree on giving each other enough to make it profitable for us as individuals (although ultimately we are just participants in this study), I believe a fair and balanced approach is key.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I come from a strong middle-class family in New York City, where both of my parents hold professional positions as educators. I am a software engineer who excels at problem-solving and take on complex coding challenges with enthusiasm. Collaboration is integral to me, allowing for the growth and strength that comes with working alongside others towards a common goal. Besides my profession, I enjoy being active and love to run marathons in my free time.\n\nI find myself paired randomly with another Asian American female player in this experiment. The concept of giving her some amount of money from an unspecified pool is not what initially draws me into the decision-making process; instead, it's understanding the context that guides my approach.\n\nAs a person who values fairness and collaboration, I recognize that my contribution to the outcome will impact both our shares significantly if we split equally. However, considering the potential for maximizing our personal gains while still ensuring fair play, it feels important to distribute the money in a manner that benefits both of us.\n\nGiven these considerations, my belief is that sharing the responsibilities or outcomes equitably might lead to the best possible outcome for all participants involved. Therefore, I would prefer a balanced approach where we each get an equal share from what's available. This strategy aligns with my desire to see mutual progress and success rather than individualized gain at another's expense.\n\nWith this understanding of fairness, I will give ___ dollars (indicating the number needed).",
