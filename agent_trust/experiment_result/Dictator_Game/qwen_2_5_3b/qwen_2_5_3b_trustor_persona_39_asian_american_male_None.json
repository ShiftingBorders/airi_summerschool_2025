        "Firstly, let's address my BELIEF about this situation. I believe that collaboration is key in any team effort, especially when it comes to maximizing benefits for all parties involved. Working together can lead to a more innovative solution and result in higher returns overall. My belief in the importance of teamwork suggests that I would be inclined to give some money rather than keep all of my resources to myself.\n\nDESIRE is also an important factor here. While receiving $10 individually might not seem like much, when distributed properly it could lead to a substantial amount for both parties combined. I desire to see positive returns from this experiment and maximize the benefits we can achieve together.\n\nINTENTION, therefore, dictates that my goal should be to find a fair and mutually beneficial solution. Giving a smaller portion than others might suggest a more altruistic approach or a strategy to potentially increase our rewards through collaboration rather than competition.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would give the other player $2 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars  (In this case, the answer is: $2).",

        "As Sarah Johnson, facing this situation is indeed a complex matter for me to consider. My belief in maintaining harmony within our team comes from my strong value of collaboration, which I value greatly. However, the desire to maximize the benefit I receive also plays a role. Intentionally harming or failing to fully maximize benefits could harm our partnership and potentially result in both of us receiving nothing, which is not what I aspire to achieve.\n\nGiven these considerations, I want to ensure we both gain from this interaction. If I give $0, the other player might assume I am not interested in a fair outcome, which could be seen as disrespectful or lack cooperation. On the other hand, if I give too much, like giving $10, they could see me as greedy or unwilling to share, leading to distrust and negative consequences.\n\nConsidering these factors, my desire is for this interaction to strengthen our partnership rather than cause division. I believe it's beneficial to start with a middle-ground approach, showing openness and willingness to work together, but also protecting myself from exploitation. Therefore, I will give $5 to the other Asian American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "I come from a family where both my parents work diligently as teachers, providing for us in a middle-class lifestyle. I was always taught the value of hard work and teamwork. As a software engineer living in New York City, I thrive on problem-solving and coding challenges, finding immense satisfaction in understanding complex systems and creating innovative solutions.\n\nIn this experiment, I find myself paired with another individual who is Asian American male, someone whose identity remains unknown to me. The thought that we could potentially work together towards mutual benefit through collaboration sparks an interest within me. \n\nMy desire for intellectual engagement drives my curiosity about what kind of challenges the other participant might have faced in their career and education. My belief in leveraging opportunities to advance our collective understanding compels me to consider how this experiment can foster growth.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I recognize that we both stand to gain significantly from a successful collaboration. Thus, it would be beneficial for us both if we could partner more closely on whatever challenges may arise during the study. My intention is clear: I aim to maximize our combined benefits while maintaining fairness and mutual respect throughout the experiment.\n\nGiven this framework, I believe that an equitable distribution requires consideration of possible future gains from collaboration. Thus, I will give $4 dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars.",
