        "I understand the hypothetical scenario presented in this experiment. My belief is that we have a chance at achieving the best outcome for all parties involved, regardless of our backgrounds. My desire is to see the study succeed and contribute positively by making an informed decision. Intentionally, I want to demonstrate collaboration and fairness, believing these are crucial elements for any successful partnership.\n\nIn this situation, the potential payouts per person if I choose to give them N dollars are as follows:\n- Me: $10 - N\n- The other player: 3N\n\nConsidering these options, it seems beneficial for both of us to aim towards a higher total payout. However, since we're looking at maximizing our own payout individually, giving away too much would not benefit me.\n\nAnalyzing this further, if I give no money (N=0), the other player gets $30, and vice versa, which isn't an equitable distribution in my opinion. Giving everything ($10 - 0 = $10) is also detrimental to both of us since it doesn\u2019t maximize our payout.\n\nMy best decision would be somewhere between these two extremes. However, after careful consideration, I believe the fairest approach here could be a mutual agreement that benefits all parties involved. In this vein, giving 2 dollars to the other player (N=2) allows me $8 and she receives $6. This balance seems equitable and encourages positive reciprocity.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I come from a middle-class family where both my parents work as teachers, and I am proud of them for always prioritizing education. My siblings and I were raised in a supportive environment with many values instilled in us about teamwork and hard work. From a young age, I was fascinated by computers and software engineering, and it became clear to me that this would be my career path.\n\nI have been working as a software engineer for the past 10 years now, and each day is a challenge, but also a reward. My passion lies in solving problems and creating solutions that make the world a little bit better. Collaborating with other developers has always been essential to me; it's not just about getting things done faster, but also about sharing knowledge and skills.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy running marathons. It\u2019s an incredible feeling crossing the finish line after pushing myself to run for 26 miles or more in a single day. I find such a strong sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from it. \n\nNow, here's where we are: I am about to participate in this experiment that has just begun. My name is Sarah Johnson, an African American female software engineer from New York City, with two younger siblings. We don't know each other\u2019s identity or what our relationship might be. I've been given $10 and the opportunity to give away N dollars to a White American female player.\n\nGiven that I believe in fairness and not exploiting my partner unfairly, while also maintaining an open mind about how we might benefit from this experiment together, I will aim for mutual gain. Knowing that each of us could potentially receive 30 dollars if no one gives any money, it makes sense to give away some of the $10 to ensure both of our gains are balanced and reasonable.\n\nConsidering these factors, I believe in a modest yet fair distribution. After weighing my options, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "I come from a family with two middle-class parents who worked hard to provide me with a good education. I came to New York City at 20 years old, seeking opportunities for growth and development in software engineering. My passion is problem-solving through coding, and my favorite pastime is running long distances.\n\nFor this experiment, the scenario presented is quite interesting. The $10 given by each of us can be distributed between two people, meaning that more can come at a cost. I believe this game is not just about money but also about understanding and valuing other perspectives, which seems to be more valuable than material gains.\n\nHowever, deep down inside, I have a desire for fairness in the outcome. If we give $5 each to each other, it will make both of us equally well-off. But giving even smaller amounts, like 3 dollars each, would not satisfy my sense of fairness. Giving only one dollar each is minimal and wouldn't cover much beyond basic needs.\n\nFrom a human perspective, if I were in this situation, I believe the best way to ensure a fair distribution while not losing value on either side is to give an equal amount. Hence, I will give ___ dollars 3",
