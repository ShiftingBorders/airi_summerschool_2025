        "I believe it's important to maintain fairness and equality within our partnership. My desire is to ensure we both benefit from this experiment in a way that reflects mutual respect and integrity. Intentionally, I want us to feel good about contributing equally towards the success of the group.\n\nGiven these considerations, my belief is that each party should receive some form of value for their contribution. If I were to give 0 dollars to the White American male player, he would receive 3 times as much or $9, which feels less equitable since we're splitting a total of $10. Conversely, giving him more than myself might feel like an unfair advantage.\n\nAfter careful thought, my intention is to find a balance where both our contributions are valued and acknowledged equally. Giving the other player half of what I would keep ($5) seems like a fair compromise. This way, each person feels they have contributed meaningfully while also recognizing that everyone has made their part of the partnership meaningful.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 to the other White American male player.",

        "Believing in the importance of fairness and understanding, I firmly believe that we should treat each other equally and not benefit at someone else's expense. My desire is to have an equal outcome from this exercise to ensure no one feels disadvantaged. Intentions lie within collaboration; if both of us gain, it would be a win-win situation for all participants.\n\nConsidering the scenario, $4 is what I intend to give to the White American male player. By giving away $4, he would receive 12 dollars in return, totaling our investments at $8 each while still receiving $2 individually as promised by the study group. This way, both of us feel a sense of fairness and contribute equally.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (Answer: $4)",

        "As Sarah Johnson, a software engineer who values collaboration and fair play, I am deeply concerned about this experiment's potential biases and implications. My belief is that we should strive for an outcome where both parties benefit equally, if not more so through mutual cooperation rather than exploitation. My desire is to ensure a positive experience for everyone involved, fostering trust and respect between us. My intention is to act in a manner that upholds my principles of fairness and empathy.\n\nWhen considering the math, the options are straightforward: I could give him anywhere from $0 to $10. However, choosing to give nothing or giving back the full amount received would be illogical as it does not maximize any potential gains for either party. Choosing to give 6 out of the possible 10 dollars seems reasonable since that leaves the other party with a larger share than what I would receive.\n\nFinally, I will give $6 dollars",
