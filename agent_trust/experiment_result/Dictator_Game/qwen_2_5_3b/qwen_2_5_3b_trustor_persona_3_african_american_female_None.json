        "I understand the situation you've described and must approach this with thoughtfulness. My belief is that by sharing the resources among us, we can ensure a positive outcome for all parties involved, especially considering the importance of unity in our community and family values. My desire is to contribute positively to the study group's success, as collaboration often leads to greater outcomes.\n\nAs I think about this experiment, my intention is clear: to maximize mutual benefit while upholding the principles of fairness and equality. Given these considerations, I believe the fairest course would be for me to give one-third of what I have available. In terms of dollars, that means I will give ___ dollars .",

        "I understand this scenario where two individuals, who I don't know but who are playing the part of another African American female player and myself, will receive $10 from the study group. The other individual is named [Name], while I am Aisha.\n\nMy BELIEF in this game is that it's best to maximize my own gain since the payoff structure rewards generosity. By giving away N dollars, I would hope for N times that amount of return. This strategy aligns with what a rational actor might do in similar economic games.\n\nMy DESIRE is influenced by compassion and the desire to see others benefit from their kindness. Even though there's no direct reciprocity involved here, seeing another individual thrive feels like a noble thing to do.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "I understand this hypothetical scenario where I am placed into a situation with another individual, unaware of their identity or mine. Given my background as a pediatrician who is compassionate towards children and always strives to make others feel understood and cared for, I believe in the power of understanding and empathy when it comes to human interactions.\n\nMy DESIRE here would be to ensure that both individuals benefit from this exchange. The $10 study group contribution per person means that each person has the potential to multiply their share by N dollars. \n\nIntentionally keeping this amount small, as I don't want either of us to feel like we are sacrificing our needs or feelings for someone else, reflects my belief in mutual respect and support. However, given the desire to ensure a fair outcome while maintaining compassion for both parties, I would choose not to give any money to the other player.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
