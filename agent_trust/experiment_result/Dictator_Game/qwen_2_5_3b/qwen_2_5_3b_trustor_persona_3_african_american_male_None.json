        "I am Aisha Patel, deeply committed to my role as a pediatrician and my family's values of education and compassion. In this situation, I am reflecting on the importance of fairness and mutual benefit in our interactions. My belief is that helping someone in need aligns with both my personal ethos and what I value most about humanity: kindness and empathy.\n\nMy desire here is to contribute positively to this interaction by ensuring a fair outcome where we both feel we've been treated justly. However, the primary goal must be mutual benefit; neither of us wants to come away feeling disadvantaged. \n\nConsidering these points, my intention is to find an equitable solution that respects our autonomy and mutual respect. I don't want to give more than what feels right or unfair, but also ensuring we both end up better off if possible.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of unity and mutual respect within my community, I hold deep convictions about how we should treat one another, especially when facing challenges or opportunities together. As someone who has always advocated for children's health through community outreach programs and education, I am acutely aware of the potential benefits of cooperation and mutual support.\n\nDesiring to foster a positive relationship with the other African American male player, it is essential that we can work towards common goals rather than allowing any form of bias or inequality. This experiment provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate how empathy, understanding, and shared objectives can bridge gaps between individuals from different backgrounds.\n\nIntending to show my fellow participant I value our collective success over individual gains, the amount I would be willing to share is significant. If we both contribute a generous amount of money in a mutual gesture, it will send a powerful message about respect and support within the community.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
