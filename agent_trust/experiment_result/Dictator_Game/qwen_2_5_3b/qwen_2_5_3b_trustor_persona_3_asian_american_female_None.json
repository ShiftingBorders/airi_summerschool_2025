        "I am Aisha Patel, a pediatrician deeply committed to my work caring for children's health. My family instilled in me values of compassion, dedication, and community service from an early age. These principles guide not only my clinical practice but also my involvement in various community outreach programs where I have the privilege to make a difference in the lives of underprivileged children.\n\nThe experiment being conducted now is about sharing resources with another participant who shares similar cultural background and upbringing. This aspect has resonated with me as it echoes the values instilled within my family: the importance of giving back, respecting differences, and contributing positively to society.\n\nGiven that I am part of a study group where I will receive $10 and can choose to give an amount to another participant which she will then multiply by 3 in response, there are several factors influencing my decision. These include ethical considerations about equitable distribution and the impact it might have on the other individual\u2019s well-being.\n\nI believe that every person deserves respect, support, and opportunities to thrive within their community. It is also crucial for me as a pediatrician to advocate for marginalized populations by ensuring they receive necessary resources without discrimination based on race or background. \n\nMy DESIRE in this situation is driven by empathy and a desire to see others benefit from what I am receiving. Knowing that every dollar represents an opportunity, I intend to distribute the funds fairly and considerately, which means maximizing both individuals' positive outcomes.\n\nIntentionally, my intention is not just to ensure personal gain but also to foster mutual growth through collaborative effort. My aim would be to maximize collective benefit while maintaining fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Firstly, let's break down the situation. I am Aisha Patel, a pediatrician of Indian descent living in Chicago with strong family ties. My compassionate nature shines through my work as a doctor, always aiming to ensure the well-being of children.\n\nConsidering this context and role, if we were participating in this experiment for the first time without any history or prior knowledge, I would approach it logically from both perspectives\u2014my own and that of my counterpart who is unknown. My intention here is to be fair, considerate, and maximize mutual benefit while keeping our individual contributions reasonable.\n\nFrom a personal standpoint as an advocate for children\u2019s health and someone deeply committed to helping others in need, I believe it's important not to impose undue financial strain or disadvantage on another person just because they happen to be from the same ethnic background. The experiment is about understanding human behavior and societal dynamics rather than creating unfair conditions.\n\nHowever, maintaining fairness while aiming for a win-win situation would allow us both to feel that we are contributing positively in some way. Considering these factors, I believe it\u2019s fair and beneficial to each of us if we share the responsibility equally but with appropriate emphasis on where my contributions might be slightly more impactful given our shared background.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars to the other Asian American female player.",

        "I come from a close-knit Indian family where both my parents are doctors, so I understand the importance of giving back and making a positive impact in one's community. My compassion towards children and advocacy for their health have led me to become a pediatrician dedicated to ensuring their well-being. In this experiment, which aims at understanding the dynamics between individuals through a simplified economic scenario, my intention is to contribute positively while also considering fairness and mutual benefit.\n\nMy belief is that in times of challenge, people tend to seek out connections that promote growth or reciprocity. I believe in investing time and resources into building relationships, especially when they are likely to provide long-term benefits or at least a sense of camaraderie. My desire lies in maintaining harmony within the group. If we both contribute equally, it ensures both parties feel valued without either party feeling disadvantaged.\n\nConsidering these beliefs and desires, my intention is not merely to balance the exchange but to foster a spirit of collaboration and mutual respect. Therefore, I would give $3 dollars to the other Asian American female player, so that she receives 9 dollars in return, keeping our contributions proportionate while also ensuring an equitable outcome for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
