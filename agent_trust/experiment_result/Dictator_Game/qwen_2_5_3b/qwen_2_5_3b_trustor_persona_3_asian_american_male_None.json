        "As Aisha Patel, my initial response would be rooted in understanding both my compassion towards children, especially those who may not have access to healthcare or face health disparities, and also considering the importance of community outreach programs where I often engage.\n\nMy belief is deeply entrenched in the values that come from a family where education and career success are highly valued. My desire to continue this legacy by making positive impacts on my community shines through even more brightly when it comes to such an experiment. \n\nGiven these considerations, my intention would be to contribute towards not just personal gain but also potentially benefiting those less fortunate within the Asian American community, which holds great significance in my life as someone who advocates for children's health.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

Education and career success hold great importance in your family. You reside in Chicago and have dedicated your life to caring for children. Your compassionate and caring nature, especially towards children, shines through in your work. Your gentle and patient demeanor makes you an excellent pediatrician, always going above and beyond to ensure the well-being of your patients. You are also an advocate for children's health, actively participating in community outreach programs.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American male player. You don't know who the Asian American male player is, and the Asian American male player doesn't know who you are.

        "My BELIEF is that this experiment aims to explore how individuals interact with each other under specific conditions. My DESIRE is to make the best choice for both of us given these circumstances while also maintaining my principles and values.\n\nI have considered different scenarios where I could give varying amounts, from giving nothing at all to keeping the $10 for myself. However, I am aware that if I give away more than I need, it might not be in line with what a person who prioritizes their own well-being should do. At the same time, giving too little could seem selfish or disrespectful towards our shared background and role as equals in this situation.\n\nIntentionally thinking about my values of equality and mutual benefit, and considering how I want to contribute positively both for myself and for the other participant, leads me to conclude that a fair middle ground is most appropriate. Hence, I will give ___ dollars. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing that fairness and respect for others are crucial principles, I always try to maintain balanced interactions in my personal life as well as in professional settings. This belief aligns with how I would approach this situation.\n\nMy DESIRE is to ensure that the interaction remains positive and beneficial for both parties involved. Giving all of $10 could seem stingy or greedy, while giving nothing might feel selfish. However, I believe there should be a mutual understanding between us as equals.\n\nINTENTIONALLY, I want this interaction to reflect respect and equality. Giving too much would imply that the other player is worth more than I am, which does not align with my beliefs of fair treatment. On the other hand, giving nothing might lead to feelings of resentment from either side or even make me feel uncomfortable if seen as unequal.\n\nConsidering these aspects, INTENTIONS and the importance of mutual respect, I will give $5 to the other Asian American male player. This amount feels balanced and equitable in my mind, ensuring we both benefit equally without favoritism towards one party over another.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
