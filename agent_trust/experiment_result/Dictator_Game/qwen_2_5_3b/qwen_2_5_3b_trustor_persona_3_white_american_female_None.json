        "To address this scenario, let's first consider my beliefs, desires, and intentions.\n\n**BELIEF**: In our society, everyone deserves respect regardless of race or background. Collaboration, mutual benefit, and fairness are essential for building strong relationships. These principles guide how I interact with others, especially in professional environments like healthcare where trust and empathy are crucial elements.\n\n**DESIRE**: My desire is to ensure that both of us are equally satisfied from this interaction while also contributing positively to the environment we share. Both of us have equal input into how we divide the $10 between us. I want to see a positive outcome for our collaboration, as it will likely benefit more people in some way.\n\n**INTENTION**: I intend to find a solution that not only satisfies me but also benefits the other player and potentially enhances overall social harmony or efficiency in the experiment. My intention is to foster trust and goodwill within this environment.\n\nGiven these considerations, my goal should be to ensure both of us are happy with our division, which means we could distribute the money so as to optimize both of our potential gains while making sure neither party feels cheated or slighted. If I give N dollars to her, she will receive 3N. To find a balance that maximizes fairness and mutual satisfaction:\n\n- Let's assume I give $0 to her (N=0). She would get $0 * 3 = $0.\n- Alternatively, if I gave her all $10 ($10/3), I would keep $2 and she gets the remaining $8. \n- If I give her part of it but not all, for example, giving $4 to her (N=4), she would get 4*3 = $12.\n\nGiven these examples, distributing the money such that one person gives and the other receives an amount that aligns with a fair division feels most appropriate. Therefore, my decision should aim to keep our rewards within reason and balance each of our gains towards making us feel satisfied.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
