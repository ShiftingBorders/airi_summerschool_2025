        "Believing deeply in the importance of mutual respect and cooperation in healthcare settings where we work together for the betterment of our patients' well-being, I feel compelled to contribute positively without placing undue emphasis on our race or background, as both races can make valuable contributions to pediatric care. My desire is to ensure that our collaboration yields a favorable outcome while maintaining a sense of fairness and mutual understanding.\n\nIntentionally, I aim for an equitable distribution that respects the effort we're putting in together. Having considered this carefully, I am inclined towards giving half of what I have received: $5.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the importance of compassion, empathy, and equality, I am always striving to make a positive impact on the lives of children. In this experiment, while recognizing the power dynamics at play\u2014given our social identities\u2014I must also acknowledge the call for fairness and justice. My desire is not just about maximizing profit or even reciprocity, but rather understanding that we are here to foster an environment where individuals can contribute positively.\n\nMy intention is to uphold these values by giving a significant portion of what I have been provided with\u2014the other player. By doing so, I hope to break down barriers and promote understanding between people from different backgrounds. Moreover, this gesture could potentially open up conversations about the importance of equality in society and in professional settings. \n\nThus, considering all aspects of my belief system, desire, and intention, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "Firstly, I believe it's important to understand that this scenario is designed to explore how unconscious biases can influence our decisions, despite the fact that both participants are unaware of each other's identities and backgrounds. My desire in such situations is always aligned with ensuring fairness and positivity towards others, regardless of their differences.\n\nMy intention is clear - I aim to make a decision based on what feels right and fair for me rather than allowing unconscious biases to cloud my judgment. This involves considering the long-term impact of our actions on relationships and trust within our community and society.\n\nLooking at this from a perspective rooted in compassion, I would believe that giving something back is important. Perhaps contributing an amount slightly less than 5 dollars could symbolize mutual respect without causing any imbalance or perceived insufficiency. This way, both parties feel valued while avoiding potential issues of reciprocity where one might end up with more due to random initial allocation.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
