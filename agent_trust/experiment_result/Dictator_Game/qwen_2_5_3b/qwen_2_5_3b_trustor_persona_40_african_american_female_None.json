        "Alright, let's think about this situation like I would. I've got $10 from the study group to give to someone else. My first thought is about fairness and mutual benefit. Giving too much could mean I get nothing or even less than I'd receive if we split it 50-50. If I give nothing, I'm just as likely to end up with zero as not playing at all. \n\nGiving half would make things equal between us but doesn't seem like the best option since both of us could come out equally short on resources or fun.\n\nConsidering my desire for equality and mutual benefit, I think giving three dollars seems reasonable. It gives a sense of fairness and allows me to participate in an equitable way. If this strategy works well with the other player, we'll each end up with $8, which is better than splitting nothing and could be seen as starting cooperation rather than competition.\n\nSo, I believe this action would respect both of our contributions and potentially encourage more cooperative behavior from others in the future, even if it's just a small experiment. If everyone played like this, there'd be more resources to share collectively.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
