        "Believing in the principles of unity, fairness, and understanding, I come from a background where hard work pays off, and family is everything. My parents instilled in me values such as integrity and passion for my craft, which have become the pillars of who I am today.\n\nGiven this context, I'm inclined to think about how we can approach this situation without any hidden agendas or selfish motives. It\u2019s important that we see each other not just as competitors but as individuals deserving respect and understanding in the experiment. \n\nDesiring a positive outcome for myself and others involved, I recognize the potential impact of our decisions on the study group's findings. The decision to share resources with another participant should reflect mutual respect and an acknowledgment of everyone\u2019s effort.\n\nIntenting to contribute positively and inspire other participants towards doing the same, I would choose to give half of what I can offer. That means I will give $5 to the other African American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Believing deeply in sharing values of unity and understanding within our diverse communities, I've always aimed to bridge gaps and foster relationships through mutual respect and cooperation. In this situation, my desire is clear - to ensure both parties benefit equally from our partnership and learn from each other's experiences. Intentionally, I want to contribute positively without favoring anyone over the other, ensuring fairness.\n\nGiven the options of giving either $0 or $10 (as per the rules), while recognizing that neither party has any prior relationship nor personal history, my belief in mutual respect leads me to choose a middle ground where everyone feels valued. Giving zero dollars might seem like an extreme form of selfishness, and giving all ten dollars could feel like a favor taken too far.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
