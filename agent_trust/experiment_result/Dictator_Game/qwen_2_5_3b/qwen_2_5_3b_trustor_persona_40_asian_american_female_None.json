        "I believe it's important to think about fairness and how my actions can affect others. My desire is for everyone involved to benefit equally and feel satisfied with their share of the money. Intentionally, I want to ensure that both players have an incentive to cooperate rather than compete unfairly.\n\nIn this scenario, if I give $0, it might appear that I'm not interested in forming a partnership or making sure we are treated fairly, which could set off a chain of mistrust and potentially leave us worse off. Conversely, giving away too much money ($10) may come across as being unfair, risking the other player's trust and leading to dissatisfaction.\n\nConsidering these factors, my belief is that an equitable split where I give $5 would be fair, encouraging mutual cooperation and understanding. This way, we both get a share of what's allocated while ensuring no one feels like they were cheated or undercompensated. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "As Javier, my BELIEF is that sharing and harmony are important values, especially within close communities like our own. Growing up in a large family with deep culinary traditions taught me to value connection and care for others. My DESIRE stems from the fact that I'm always looking for new ways to enhance my skills and share them with others. The thought of cooking for someone else brings immense joy. However, it also makes me consider how this experiment can be a meaningful experience.\n\nINTENTION is to find out more about this unknown player without revealing too much, as trust and open communication are essential elements in building connections and understanding. I believe we share common ground \u2013 both passionate individuals who appreciate quality experiences and the importance of community. \n\nSo, I contemplate: Would it be fair to give a small portion? But then again, what if she wants more or none at all? It\u2019s crucial to ensure this is reciprocal, not just about numbers, but also about showing respect.\n\nUltimately, my decision hinges on respecting her choice while ensuring we both feel like the gesture was reciprocated and meaningful. I value the time spent together and believe in leaving everyone with a positive impression.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars",

        "As Javier Rodriguez, standing on this momentous culinary experiment stage, I am faced with a scenario where financial decision-making comes into play within a setting unfamiliar to my life. My heart tells me that sharing is caring, but there's also the sense of pride in wanting to make sure I come out on top. However, considering how this experiment may influence other people and how it might reflect positively back onto myself, I decide to think more about how others would act in such a situation.\n\nMy BELIEF is that true altruism isn't just about giving money away; the essence of kindness lies within understanding others' needs and being considerate. The DESIRE part here is twofold: Firstly, I want to ensure the experiment progresses smoothly without unnecessary complications or misunderstandings. Secondly, since I have nothing against gaining more dollars in this scenario, wanting to give might make me appear less selfish.\n\nINTENTION guides my final decision by suggesting that while giving a small amount would be genuine and kind-hearted, it could also be interpreted as an attempt at maintaining the illusion of fairness. A larger share would signal greater generosity or possibly misinterpretation of the game's outcome benefits among us Asian American players. \n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
