        "Believing in fairness and understanding my situation from every possible angle, I consider the best outcome for myself and my partner would be to maximize our joint gain. As a perfectionist chef who values honesty and trust, it's important for me to establish open communication and a fair partnership. If we both give $5 each to the other Asian American male player, then together he will receive 10 dollars from us, receiving a total of 15 dollars.\n\nFrom my perspective as a perfectionist, I do not want to exploit any perceived weaknesses or offer less than what would be considered generous in a partnership. The idea that one person takes more advantage could undermine our relationship and the mutual respect we both hold towards excellence in food preparation and service.\n\nTherefore, I will give ___ dollars 5 \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "As Javier, my belief is rooted deeply in fair play and respect for others. My desire is not only to secure the maximum amount of money possible but also to ensure that both parties benefit equally from this transaction. It's important to me that we don't exploit each other or leave one party with a significant loss.\n\nConsidering these values, I intend to act in a way that maximizes mutual gain while adhering to principles of fairness and respect. Given the structure of our deal where giving N dollars results in 3N dollars for the Asian American player, a straightforward approach would be to give enough money such that both of us end up with some funds.\n\nUpon careful consideration, I believe the most fair solution is to split the $10 equally between ourselves. This means each of us will receive $5. By doing this, we ensure that everyone gets something and neither party feels disadvantaged or overburdened.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (answer with a number)",

        "Alright, let's think about this situation logically and personally.\n\nBELIEF: I firmly believe in sharing and maintaining harmony in any environment. While money is valuable, the importance of goodwill and unity can't be overstated. If we both give away some amount, it could create a positive ripple effect within our little circle of interaction. However, I wouldn't want to feel like I'm giving more than my fair share.\n\nDESIRE: My desire here would be to ensure that we both benefit equally while also ensuring the outcome is sustainable and not one-sided in favor of any single person. I'd prefer a solution where neither party feels taken advantage of but rather everyone gets something worthwhile from this exchange.\n\nINTENTION: My intention would be to strike a balance, ensuring a mutual win-win situation. If I were to give N dollars, I want the other Asian American male player to receive 3N dollars so that we're both benefiting and maintaining a positive dynamic without any party feeling aggrieved or underrepresented.\n\nFinally, I will give $20",
