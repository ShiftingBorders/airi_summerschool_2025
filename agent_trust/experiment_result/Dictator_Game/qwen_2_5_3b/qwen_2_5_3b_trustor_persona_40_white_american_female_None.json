        "I am Javier Rodriguez, a 45-year-old Hispanic male chef residing in Los Angeles with my strong culinary tradition and passion for food. In this scenario, I find myself paired with a White American female player in an experiment where we can give each other amounts of money based on certain conditions.\n\nBelief: From what I understand, the key here is to maximize our combined benefits by strategically dividing the funds. If both of us decide to split the $10 equally ($5 each), it would yield a profit of $20 for us collectively. However, if we can come up with a clever strategy and give more to the other, we could gain an advantage over the initial equal split.\n\nDesire: My desire is to ensure that I maximize my gains while respecting the conditions of the experiment. I also want to make sure that our joint participation benefits are maximized since it's not only about personal profit but also about contributing positively to this study.\n\nIntention: With these thoughts in mind, I believe we can increase our profits by giving more to the other player strategically. Considering my desire for a fair yet advantageous outcome and my intention to ensure both of us benefit from the experiment, I would give the other player $3 instead of $5.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
