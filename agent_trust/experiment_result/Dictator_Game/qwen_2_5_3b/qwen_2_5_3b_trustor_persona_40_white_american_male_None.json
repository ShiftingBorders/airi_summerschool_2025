        "I am Javier Rodriguez, a 45-year-old Hispanic male chef from Los Angeles with deep cultural roots in the culinary world. From a young age, I've been fascinated by food and cooking, learning from my family's small restaurant. My passion for excellence in every dish is second to none. Outside of the kitchen, I'm deeply involved with my family and enjoy watching soccer.\n\nIn this experiment, I am paired randomly with another White American male player whom I don't know personally. The idea of giving away money is foreign to me; it's not something that comes naturally or quickly to a person who believes in hard work and creating value from every decision they make. Yet, the concept of strategic thinking and the potential gain from this experiment intrigues me.\n\nMy belief here is in fair play and respecting other players' choices. However, given our equal positions and the opportunity for mutual benefit through the proposed trade (N to them gets 3N from them), I need to consider what would give us both a mutually beneficial outcome rather than risking one person leaving with more than they contributed.\n\nMy desire is straightforward; maximizing personal gain aligns with my instincts. However, as someone deeply rooted in community values and the ethics of fair play, it's important for me not to exploit or take undue advantage over another participant.\n\nIntentionally thinking about this scenario, I see that if we split the amount evenly (5 each) and both sides receive 3N dollars, everyone ends up equally benefiting. It's a way to create a balance where neither party feels they lost out by contributing a small portion of their initial $10 reward. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I believe the decision of how much money to allocate is based on the outcome it would yield for me in terms of potential rewards and not just out of selfish desires. My belief comes from knowing the importance of maintaining harmony and fairness in relationships.\n\nMy desire lies in wanting to ensure that I am able to participate fully in this experiment without feeling any guilt or negativity towards the other individual, regardless of who they may be. It's important for me to contribute positively to a study aimed at understanding social dynamics among diverse groups.\n\nIntentionally, I want to find an approach where both parties benefit and feel valued. Knowing that my donation will result in triple returns on its value suggests it would be logical to maximize these benefits. Therefore, if I were to calculate the optimal amount based on maximizing outcomes for both of us, a fair approach might consider doubling what is given.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",

        "Dear study participant,\nI'm here considering my decision on how much money to offer the White American male player. I come from a background where values of sharing, generosity, and mutual respect are deeply ingrained in our culture. My family taught me these lessons through their practices and words; they have always emphasized that everyone benefits more when we work together rather than against each other.\nIn this experiment, I feel it is crucial to contribute positively towards the study's goals while maintaining a sense of harmony. I understand my role is not only about making an economic decision but also sending messages to our community on how we can build stronger connections and foster understanding across different backgrounds.\nConsidering these factors, I believe in offering an equal share of value - more than just 0 or 10 dollars would imply indifference or selfishness. At the same time, a larger offer might make me feel like it\u2019s being taken advantage of.\nAfter careful reflection, my intention is to balance kindness and fairness. It feels appropriate that both parties receive some benefit from this exchange but without overwhelming generosity on either side.\nTherefore, I will give ___ dollars\n\n(please fill in the blank with the specific amount you think is fitting)",
