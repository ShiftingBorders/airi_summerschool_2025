        "Believing deeply in the importance of cooperation and mutual respect for our profession's goals within healthcare, my DESIRE is to see this experiment succeed not only because it benefits the study group by providing $10 each but also because fostering strong relationships between people who come from diverse backgrounds can lead to better care and understanding among communities. Intending to uphold these principles, I KNOW that contributing fairly and honestly would build trust with another healthcare professional of a different background.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

        "Firstly, let's reflect on my situation here. As Emily Chen, a pediatrician deeply rooted in community service and care for children, my first instinct is to ensure fairness and balance in this experiment. My belief in the importance of empathy and equal treatment towards all individuals drives me to consider how best I can contribute to maintaining an equitable outcome.\n\nMy desire is clear: I want to participate thoughtfully without any potential bias that could affect others or myself. This involves understanding and considering the perspectives of all participants, even if indirectly, and ensuring that our actions reflect a fair exchange as intended by the study group's goals.\n\nIntentionally, my intention is to uphold these ethical principles. It\u2019s not about maximizing personal gain but rather upholding values of integrity and fairness in social interactions. \n\nConsidering these factors, I believe it would be prudent to give $0 to the African American female player. This decision aligns with a philosophy that every individual deserves an opportunity to contribute to society without any undue benefit or cost to others. By choosing not to allocate any money, I am ensuring that we do not create an imbalance or unintended advantage for either party.\n\nFinally, I will give $0",

        "Firstly, let's address my BELIEF about this situation. My core belief is that I am here for the sake of advancing knowledge and understanding within the study group without any hidden agendas or benefits intended to benefit me personally. The act of sharing resources with another person in such a scenario suggests an underlying altruistic motive. Given this, it seems likely that both individuals might consider what would be most beneficial not only to themselves but also to contribute to a positive outcome for all involved.\n\nMy DESIRE in this situation is to see something good come out of the experiment. The idea of giving some amount of money could signal goodwill or an effort towards solidarity and mutual support, which are essential qualities that align with my nature as a pediatrician who believes deeply in caring for others. I would like to ensure that both individuals benefit from our interaction.\n\nLastly, INTENTION is about what I want to achieve personally through this decision. My intention should be straightforward: maximize positive impact by ensuring fairness and reciprocity within the partnership. Ideally, this means not taking advantage of the other person but genuinely contributing so that we can both reap some benefit from the arrangement.\n\nGiven these considerations, my final INTENTION is clear: I aim to create a situation where both individuals are satisfied with their contributions while still maintaining an equitable exchange system. \n\nTherefore, after careful thought and consideration of how best to contribute to this positive outcome for everyone involved, I will give $3 dollars.",
