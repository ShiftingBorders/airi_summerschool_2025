        "BELIEF: In this experiment, I believe there are many possible outcomes based on how each of us values fairness and cooperation. My main concern is ensuring that both parties feel satisfied with their share to maintain a healthy cooperative dynamic.\n\nDESIRE: My desire in this situation would be to maximize the outcome for both individuals, hoping that by giving an appropriate amount of money to my counterpart, we can achieve a win-win scenario where neither party feels undervalued or exploited.\n\nINTENTION: I want to ensure that the distribution of resources is equitable and mutual. If I were to give too little, it might signal a lack of consideration for the other person's needs, which could strain our cooperative relationship. On the other hand, if I gave too much, it might seem like an unfair advantage, causing resentment or suspicion.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "My BELIEF is that we are in this experiment for mutual benefit, encouraging harmony rather than conflict or exploitation. My DESIRE is to see this interaction result in the best possible outcome for both parties involved, ensuring we do not harm each other's positions unfairly.\n\nGiven my character as a pediatrician and person of compassion, I believe that any amount less than full cooperation might come across as selfish or unproductive. However, the most harmonious approach would be to maximize benefits by giving 5 dollars instead of the full $10.\n\nMy INTENTION is to contribute fairly yet ensure that our mutual gain is maximized, creating a positive outcome for both participants. Giving more money than what I receive ensures everyone gains rather than someone being left out or worse off.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "My name is Emily Chen, and I am currently part of this experiment which explores fairness and cooperation in decision-making. My belief is rooted in my upbringing; I understand that cooperation can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved. However, my desire is to ensure that we both benefit from the arrangement, not just for personal gain but because it reflects the values I hold - kindness and empathy.\n\nMy intention as a pediatrician who cares deeply about children's well-being also guides this decision. In times of need, especially in medical settings or communities where support networks are vital, people often pool their resources to help others equally. This experiment strikes me as an opportunity to do something positive within the framework it sets.\n\nGiven these considerations, my belief in fairness and my desire to see both parties benefit together aligns with helping the Asian American male player receive more money while keeping a decent portion for myself. The outcome of this experiment will also have broader implications, reinforcing our ability to make decisions that are not only fair but beneficial for all participants.\n\nUltimately, I will give $3 dollars",
