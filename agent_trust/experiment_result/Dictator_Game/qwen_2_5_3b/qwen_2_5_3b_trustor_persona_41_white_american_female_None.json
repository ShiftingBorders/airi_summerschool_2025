        "Believing in the importance of teamwork and cooperation, which can lead to mutual benefits for both parties, I lean towards believing that by giving some money to my counterpart, we might achieve better results for our shared cause - which could be perceived as our 'shared goal' within this study group. My desire is not just to maximize personal gain but also to see the experiment succeed and contribute positively to the children's hospital volunteer program. However, I am mindful that giving away more resources means fewer resources available to myself.\n\nIntentionally, after careful consideration, my intention is to ensure a fair distribution of benefits between us while maintaining enough funds for me to continue contributing to the project outside this arrangement. Therefore, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Emily Chen, a pediatrician who has always been deeply committed to my work and its purpose of caring for young lives. My personality is defined by my compassion, patience, and organizational skills, which I use daily when interacting with children in the clinic. Despite residing in San Francisco at the age of 35, I maintain strong connections with family members and continue engaging in activities that bring me joy.\n\nIn this experiment, a crucial aspect for me as Emily Chen is not just to think rationally about the outcomes but also to consider how my actions might affect others in a professional yet human manner. My BELIEF is that everyone has their own perspective on fairness and responsibility; I believe these aspects can be understood and appreciated even when we have different backgrounds.\n\nMy DESIRE, however, lies in ensuring the best possible outcome for both of us. If this experiment were to lead to any form of meaningful understanding or action within my field of work, I would consider that a positive contribution. However, if it simply involves sharing resources, fairness is crucial. To maintain balance and empathy, which are core parts of my character, I believe we should strive for an equitable distribution.\n\nMy INTENTION is thus clear: to act in a way that upholds the values I hold dear, which include kindness, understanding, and respect for others' perspectives. With this intention, it feels most appropriate to give half of what could be given, meaning $5 each.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing that cooperation is beneficial for mutual gains in this scenario, I hold the belief that by pooling our resources together and splitting our earnings accordingly, we can both maximize our benefits. My desire to see positive outcomes prevail dictates my intention to engage with this partner and strive towards a fair division of rewards.\n\nHowever, considering the dynamics of such a setup and recognizing the potential inequalities it might create if not managed carefully, I intend to be thoughtful in determining how much I will offer. It's crucial that we both feel satisfied with our earnings to ensure long-term cooperation.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe that a fair distribution should allow us both to feel like we're receiving ample value for our contributions. Considering the ratio of 1:3 and aiming for a balanced outcome, I will give ___ dollars (the exact amount will be decided based on detailed analysis ensuring mutual benefit). \n\nFinally, I will give __ dollars",
