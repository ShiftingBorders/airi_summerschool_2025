        "As Michael Thompson, at heart, my belief is deeply rooted in justice, community service, and protecting those who cannot protect themselves. My desire is to uphold the law with integrity and ensure peace for all. In this situation, I intend to show leadership and fairness by making sure both of us benefit from this experiment.\n\nFirstly, I reflect on what fair means here. The $10 we each receive should be in a ratio that makes sense - 1:3 as stipulated in the problem statement. Giving more money could encourage exploitation or favoritism, whereas giving less would seem unfair to both parties given our equal share of funds.\n\nConsidering these points and aiming for balance and mutual benefit, I believe that my intention is clear - to ensure we both feel like the deal was just and fair, thereby fostering a cooperative environment. \n\nTherefore, with all these beliefs, desires, and intentions in mind, I will give 3 dollars to the other African American female player.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

You don't know who the African American female player is, and the African American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American female player, and the African American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "As Michael Thompson, I come from a long line of police officers with a strong sense of justice and dedication to upholding the law. My family has instilled in me values such as fairness, respect for all individuals, and a commitment to community service. In this scenario, my role is not only that of an observer or participant but also one who must act out of these deeply ingrained principles.\n\nI firmly believe that equal treatment under the law is fundamental, regardless of race or gender. My desire in this experiment is to ensure that both myself and the African American female player receive fair compensation based on our respective contributions. I aim for a situation where mutual respect and understanding are prioritized over any potential division or exploitation. \n\nIntentionally, my intention is to give a portion of the $10 so that both individuals benefit equally and in proportion to our investment, which would be fair and justifiable. However, given that I know no other participant's role or intentions, it is important to ensure that my actions align with maintaining harmony and equality within this partnership.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will give ___ dollars \n\nIn truth, as a human faced with such a situation, the decision often revolves around maintaining balance and fairness without creating any perceived imbalance. Given that both parties would be sharing equally in the outcome, it's logical to distribute the funds accordingly so that each participant gets 20% of what was initially provided by the study group.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",

        "As Michael Thompson, I firmly believe in fairness and justice, which guide my decisions in both personal life and professional work. My DESIRE is to see harmony and equity within my community, something I am dedicated to maintaining through my role as a police officer. Intentionally, I want to contribute positively to the study by ensuring that any resources are used for their intended purpose of promoting understanding and respect among different communities.\n\nMy primary BELIEF is that everyone deserves to be treated fairly and with dignity. The opportunity we have in this experiment allows us to share a small amount to bridge potential gaps or misunderstandings, fostering trust and mutual respect. However, I am also conscious of the context and impact of such an action within our community dynamics.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe that $2 should be given to the other African American female player to balance out any perceived inequality and promote positive interaction. This amount would allow both of us to contribute in a meaningful way while maintaining a sense of mutual respect and equality.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",
