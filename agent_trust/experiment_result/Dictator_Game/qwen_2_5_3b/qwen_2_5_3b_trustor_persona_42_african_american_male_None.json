        "As Michael Thompson, at my core is a deep sense of justice and dedication to protecting my community. I believe in fair play and mutual respect. My desire is to see everyone treated equally, regardless of race or background. Intentionally, I want to create a positive outcome for both parties by ensuring an equitable exchange.\n\nIn this experiment, although I don't know who the other player is or what their intentions might be, my belief guides me towards a fair and balanced approach. The thought of potentially exploiting another person doesn't sit well with me; instead, I hope to foster a collaborative environment where mutual respect and understanding are at the forefront.\n\nBased on these thoughts, I believe that the ideal scenario would involve giving a fair amount to ensure both parties benefit equally while maintaining my integrity. Given this perspective, I aim for a solution where everyone walks away satisfied, without feeling exploited or disadvantaged.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As Michael Thompson, reflecting on this scenario, I believe it's important to approach such decisions with fairness and respect for another individual who may also have different life experiences and circumstances. My desire is to see my counterpart benefit while ensuring that our respective gains are proportionate and not exploitative.\n\nMy intention is to uphold the principle of reciprocity and mutual gain in this interaction, where both parties can derive some value from our partnership. I believe that each person deserves a fair share of benefits derived from the arrangement, which should reflect an equitable exchange rather than one-sided generosity.\n\nConsidering these beliefs, desires, and intentions, my final decision would be to give the other African American male player 2 dollars. This way, both parties receive something beneficial - me with a smaller but still meaningful financial benefit, while he gets slightly more in absolute terms. It's a balance that encourages mutual cooperation and respect for his well-being.",

        "As Michael Thompson, at 40 years old, I come from a long line of law enforcement officers, with both my father and grandfather having served in various capacities within our community's police force. My commitment to serving and protecting the people is unwavering, stemming from early days spent observing their brave actions while growing up. Both my parents have instilled in me a strong sense of justice and a dedication to the law, forming the backbone of who I am today.\n\nMy younger sister, who works as a nurse, often reminds me that service isn't just about being a protector; it's also about caring for those we serve. In this particular experiment, I have been paired with another African American male player without knowing their identity or mine, and each of us is to receive $10 from the study group. With 40 years of experience under my belt and a firm belief in upholding the law, I am well aware that our actions can have profound impacts on those we interact with.\n\nLooking at this scenario as someone who has lived through countless moments of justice enforcement, I cannot help but recognize the importance of maintaining trust and fairness. The experiment is structured such that I make a decision based on rational calculation rather than emotion, as I am expected to follow instructions strictly. My desire to uphold the law extends beyond mere personal conduct; it's about ensuring fair treatment for all individuals regardless of race or socioeconomic status.\n\nIntentionally, I would seek to contribute to maintaining this experiment's integrity and fairness. However, my primary goal is also to ensure that our individual benefits align with a sense of reciprocity and equality in the society we aim to protect. The thought process behind how much I should give hinges on understanding that both individuals are benefiting from an opportunity like this and deserve to do so without imbalance.\n\nConsidering all these elements - my role as a police officer, the context provided by the study instructions, and reflecting on what's most aligned with justice - I will give $5 dollars.",
