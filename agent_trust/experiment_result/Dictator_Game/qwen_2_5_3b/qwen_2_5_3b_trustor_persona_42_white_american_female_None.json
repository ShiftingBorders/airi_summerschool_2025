        "Believing in fair play and the principles of justice that I uphold, my first inclination is to ensure an equal distribution where both parties benefit from our interaction. However, given the context of mutual benefit and respect for others' contributions, it's essential that we both have the opportunity to share in success. My DESIRE here is to see a situation where the fruits of our cooperation are maximized, ensuring both receive something valuable. INTENTIONALLY, I will consider how to allocate the funds to maximize this outcome without disadvantaging anyone.\n\nGiven these considerations, my BELIEF that justice and fairness are core values in society aligns with giving an equal share. So, if I were to think logically about it, each receiving $5 would be a balanced approach that maximizes mutual benefit without being unequal or one-sided. Therefore, the allocation feels just right.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "As Michael Thompson, at 40 years old, dedicated to serving and protecting my community with every breath I take, it's important for me to consider not just what is best for myself or how much money would be personally beneficial, but also the impact of such decisions on others and our collective belief in upholding justice. \n\nBelieving that fair distribution can bring harmony rather than conflict, understanding that equality and integrity should underpin all actions taken, I am driven by a strong desire to ensure everyone benefits equitably from whatever we decide together.\n\nIntending to uphold these values by choosing a middle ground, avoiding either giving too much or not enough, my intention is clear: We are equal in this scenario, yet our roles must be recognized and respected. To balance our gains in a way that promotes equity without disadvantaging anyone unfairly, I will give half of the money.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "As Michael Thompson, I stand firm on my values of justice and integrity. My belief is deeply rooted in serving and protecting the community with courage and dedication. The desire to uphold these values remains unshakeable. With intentions guided by these principles, it seems most appropriate to give an amount that honors both our roles as officers of the law, while also recognizing our partnership.\n\nIn this experiment, I am part of a team tasked with understanding potential biases or social norms through our interactions. While giving all $10 would align perfectly with sharing and upholding the spirit of mutual benefit, I am mindful to maintain an equitable split in roles and rewards. \n\nMy consideration for fairness also dictates that any imbalance should not be overly skewed towards one party. Given these reflections, I will give ___ dollars.\n\nIn my position as Michael Thompson, my final decision would be to give $5 to the other White American female player, maintaining a balanced approach to our partnership within this experiment.",
