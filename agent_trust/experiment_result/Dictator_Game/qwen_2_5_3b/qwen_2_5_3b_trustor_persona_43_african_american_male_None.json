        "I am Aisha Patel, and my decision here is deeply personal and influenced by my values of fairness and equity. Despite not knowing the other person or their background, I believe in treating everyone with respect and ensuring that the outcome is fair for both parties involved. My desire is to maximize positive feelings among us and ensure this experiment benefits society positively.\n\nInitially, my inclination might be to give a substantial amount, perhaps 10 dollars, as I am inclined towards generosity and want our interaction to have a positive impact. However, considering the context of treating each other with respect and ensuring that both parties feel valued equally, it makes sense to find a balance.\n\nMy intention is clear: I do not wish for one party to receive more than the other without reciprocity. So after careful consideration, I aim to find an amount that feels fair yet leaves room for mutual benefit.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Aisha Patel, I am someone who values fairness and integrity above all else. The idea of creating a situation where one person benefits at another's expense is deeply troubling to me. At the same time, I recognize that any decision I make will affect both our financial outcomes, so it's crucial that I think this through carefully.\n\nFirstly, my belief about what would be fair and just in this scenario might lean towards equality or symmetry\u2014everyone contributing equally and benefiting proportionately. However, given the imbalance of contribution (my part being $10 while theirs is N dollars), I need to consider how much additional benefit I can reasonably expect them to get from me.\n\nMy desire is for us to feel comfortable and at ease with whatever decision we make. We should aim not to upset each other or leave one feeling disadvantaged, especially in a setting where our roles are temporary but significant.\n\nConsidering these points, my intention is to find a middle ground that respects our contributions and acknowledges the potential for mutual benefit while avoiding any sense of exploitation.\n\nAfter thoughtful consideration, I believe it would be fair if both of us contributed $10 each. This way, neither feels at a disadvantage nor do we create an unjustified discrepancy in benefits. \n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars",

        "Believing this is a chance to demonstrate fairness and cooperation, I will give ___ dollars\n\nMy belief here is that by sharing resources equally or slightly more generously, we can foster a collaborative environment rather than an adversarial one. By allocating $5 of my $10 to the other player, it's like offering them half of what they receive from me. This strategy reflects my desire for harmony and mutual support in a group setting. My intention is clear - I want this interaction to be positive and beneficial for both parties involved.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
