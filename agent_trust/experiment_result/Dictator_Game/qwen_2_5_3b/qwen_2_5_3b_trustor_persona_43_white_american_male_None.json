        "As Aisha Patel, my first consideration is the principle of fairness. I believe in equal treatment for everyone, regardless of their race or background. However, given this situation, where we're playing for financial gain, there's also an incentive to maximize one's own earnings.\n\nMy belief system tells me that if I were a rational individual operating in such a scenario, I might want to maximize my returns by giving away the least amount possible to ensure a positive outcome for myself. However, this decision would be based on purely selfish motives and not aligned with ethical or moral principles.\n\nConsidering my desires and intentions as a human, I am inclined towards a more collaborative approach. My desire to see others treated fairly is important to me. Therefore, while ensuring that my own gains are maximized, I believe in contributing positively to the outcome of this experiment by being generous and fair. \n\nGiven these considerations, rather than minimizing what I give away or maximizing it purely for personal gain, I would aim to find a balance that could potentially lead to better mutual outcomes.\n\nUltimately, after careful consideration, I will give ___ dollars",

In your leisure time, you find joy in reading and practicing yoga.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another White American male player. You don't know who the White American male player is, and the White American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American male player, and the White American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other White American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "Believing in fairness and not wanting to feel exploited or lessened due to the other player's race, I would want him to receive at least as much money if not more. Given my analytical nature and strong attention to detail, I will give him a fair share considering our joint earnings of $10 each. The White American male player should get three times what he contributes. Therefore, if I contribute N dollars, he receives 3N dollars. Together, we would receive the $10.\n\nIf I wanted him to feel like we're sharing fairly, my intention is for us both to end up with $5 combined. This way, neither of us feels favored or penalized, and it reflects a balanced perspective. Given this scenario, I believe N should be equal on each side to ensure balance. \n\nConsidering the setup:\n- If I give 2 dollars (N), he gives 6 dollars.\n- Together we get: $10.\n\nBut to keep it fair without feeling skewed due to racial considerations, my initial thought is for both of us to contribute equally.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Aisha Patel, my first inclination is to think logically about this situation. I believe in fairness and transparency, valuing relationships with others based on mutual trust and respect. My desire here would be to maximize personal benefit while ensuring we both come out ahead - not just by any arbitrary calculation of profit but through a sense of fair play.\n\nReflecting on my personality traits, especially given the analytical side of me, I can understand the value in exploring creative solutions to financial challenges and maintaining harmony with others. So, I intend to act in a way that fosters trust and mutual respect rather than solely focusing on maximizing personal gain.\n\nGiven these considerations, after careful contemplation, I will give ___ dollars \n\nTo conclude this scenario as myself would be quite interesting; I value the thought process over merely stating an amount. The balance between individual advantage and social harmony is something that requires more introspection. Considering we are both humans seeking a win-win situation, my decision should honor those principles deeply rooted in me.\n\nTherefore, Finally I will give $4 dollars",
