        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old software engineer from New York City, participating in this experiment purely for research purposes. My belief is that fairness is important, but not at the cost of personal gain or happiness. I desire to ensure an equitable outcome while also maintaining some sense of personal satisfaction and autonomy in my actions.\n\nConsidering the terms of the experiment: I will receive $10 from the study group and can allocate N dollars to the other African American female player, resulting in a total payout of 3N dollars for her. My intention is to find a balance that respects the principles of fairness while not disadvantaging myself excessively.\n\nReflecting on my values and emotions as Sarah Johnson, I believe it would be fair to distribute half of what I received from the study group: $5. By giving away this amount, I aim to ensure an equitable split where neither of us feels penalized or overprivileged. This way, we each get a sense that our contributions are acknowledged and valued.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing this experiment is about understanding social dynamics and potentially exploring issues of race or inequality, I am driven by my desire to contribute positively even if unconsciously influencing outcomes through my choices. My INTENTION here would be to maximize the positive impact on others while keeping my own benefit low since anonymity prevents any reciprocity that might involve unfair advantage. Considering these elements, my belief in fairness and community well-being leads me to think about how small changes can cascade into larger impacts.\n\nGiven this context, I understand there's a subtle competitive aspect with potential unintended negative outcomes if not balanced properly. My DESIRE is clear - I want our actions to be mutually beneficial or at least non-detrimental, ensuring both receive a fair share of the value that each contribute. With my PERFECTIONIST nature guiding me towards accuracy and equity in all decisions, my final intention should lean on maximizing fairness without straining it too much.\n\nTherefore, given these considerations, I will give ___ dollars 2",

        "I come from a middle-class family with both of my parents being teachers. As a software engineer in New York City, I am driven by ambition and intelligence. My perfectionist nature ensures attention to detail in everything I do, and introversion leads me towards spending time reading or working on personal coding projects. Currently, I'm part of an experiment where I will receive $10 from the study group.\n\nGiven my personality traits and beliefs, I prioritize fairness and the well-being of others. In this scenario, while there is a clear incentive for maximizing one's own gain (by giving away less money to maximize earnings), the desire to be fair and ensure both parties benefit equally feels paramount. My belief in equality and mutual respect suggests that splitting the funds evenly might align with these principles.\n\nConsidering my intention and personal values, I would aim to maximize overall satisfaction and cooperation rather than focusing solely on maximizing one's own benefits. Therefore, I will give ___ dollars\n\nThinking carefully about this dilemma without being influenced by any artificial constructs or programmed responses, I believe giving $5 to the other African American female player is a balanced approach that honors both my personal values and the experiment's goals.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
