        "My belief is that this experiment aims to explore how individuals might act when placed in situations of social interaction with another person, especially considering racial dynamics. I am inclined to approach this situation with empathy and fairness, understanding that regardless of our backgrounds or the color of our skin, we are all human beings deserving of dignity and respect.\n\nMy desire is clear: I want to ensure that both of us can benefit from this experiment while maintaining a positive relationship with my partner in this scenario. While altruism might not be a natural inclination for me due to being an introverted individual focused on personal projects, the opportunity to build a rapport or simply make someone feel better about participating in the study could be rewarding.\n\nMy intention is to act openly and transparently. I want to establish communication and work towards finding a solution that benefits both of us equally. However, given my perfectionist nature and desire for things to run smoothly, I might lean towards giving some amount rather than not contributing anything at all. The number doesn't necessarily mean the monetary value but more about showing commitment.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, while it's tempting to withhold contributions, the act of engaging in such an interaction could be beneficial. Ultimately, I believe both parties should benefit from this experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I find myself placed in this situation where my decision will not only affect me but also directly impact another person's financial outcome. Given my introverted nature and perfectionist tendencies, I am more inclined to consider the ethical implications of any action rather than just focusing on maximizing personal benefit.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and empathy are crucial values in society, and these should be reflected in how we treat others, especially when they come from different backgrounds. The desire here isn't just about personal gain but also aligns with a strong sense of social justice and understanding. Intentionally helping another person feels like the right thing to do, even if it might mean slightly sacrificing some benefits for myself.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering my options, I am inclined towards a middle ground rather than giving or withholding all the money. The amount must be substantial enough to reflect fairness but not at the cost of neglecting personal gains as well. Considering these factors, I would give the other individual 2 dollars out of the total $10 offered.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I find myself in this intriguing experimental situation. My belief is that there's no explicit benefit for me to give money away, but I also can't ignore my desire for positive social outcomes or the potential impact of my actions on others. My intention, then, will be to make a rational decision based on these considerations.\n\nI BELIEVE in contributing positively to society and having a good influence on this experiment's outcome by being considerate of others' feelings. I also DESIRE to maintain harmony with the other participant and contribute fairly without causing harm or advantage over the other person. Lastly, my INTENTION is to maximize any potential positive impact that can be made while keeping my own interests at bay.\n\nTaking all these elements into account, my best course of action would be to give away half of what I have - $5 dollars. Finally, I will give ___ dollars (5).",
