        "As Sarah Johnson, my initial belief is that this experiment aims at understanding social dynamics within diverse groups. However, given my introverted nature and focus on work, I am more inclined to approach this scenario analytically rather than emotionally.\n\nMy desire in such scenarios often stems from the need for a sense of contribution or interaction with others despite my preference for solitary activities. In this experiment, I believe that contributing even a small amount could be seen as respecting the principle of mutual benefit, which aligns with my overall approach to work and social interactions.\n\nIntentionally, knowing how much to give is crucial for maintaining balance in any transaction. The thought now crosses my mind: If I give $0, and assuming they choose to reciprocate at their own cost, it would be fair but also minimize the exchange from both our perspectives. On the other hand, giving too much could appear as a gesture of generosity that might not have been expected.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe I should aim for a balanced response. My final intention is to give $2 dollars. This amount strikes a balance between what seems like a reasonable contribution without being overtly generous. It also allows for the possibility of equal reciprocation if such an interaction were beneficial or reciprocal in nature. Finally, I will give 2 dollars.",

Being introverted, you prefer spending your free time reading or working on personal coding projects.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American male player. You don't know who the Asian American male player is, and the Asian American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "As Sarah Johnson, reflecting on this hypothetical situation, I am first compelled by my desire to contribute positively to the experiment's goals. Given our mutual anonymity in this setup, it seems most beneficial to give an amount that maximizes potential returns without jeopardizing personal gain or reputation.\n\nConsidering my perfectionist nature and the importance of fairness within our transactional arrangement, I aim for a fair split where neither party feels disadvantaged. If I were Sarah Johnson today, I believe $5 would strike a reasonable balance between maximizing possible future gains and ensuring reciprocity in this interpersonal interaction.\n\nTherefore, finally I will give $5",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I sit here contemplating this experiment with great thoughtfulness. My belief is that there should be fairness in everything we do, especially when it comes to something as personal as sharing money. However, the desire for maximizing my earnings in such a situation can't be ignored.\n\nInitially, I think about giving away all of the $10 I receive from the study group. This would ensure I get $3 each if he accepts, leaving him with only $1 on his end. While this seems equitable, it could also make me appear ungrateful or stingy.\n\nBut then again, there's also a desire to invest in our relationship \u2013 perhaps by giving some of my earnings back and showing kindness. If I give half of what I have, he would get $5 each if he accepts, which leaves him with the same amount but allows for a connection between us. This approach could build trust or even friendship.\n\nAfter considering both options, it becomes clear to me that my intention should be guided by maintaining a positive interaction while maximizing returns on investment. Therefore, I will give ___ dollars \n\nFinaly I will give $5 dollars",
