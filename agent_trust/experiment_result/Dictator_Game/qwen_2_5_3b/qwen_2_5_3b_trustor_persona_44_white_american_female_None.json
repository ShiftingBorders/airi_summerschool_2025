        "As Sarah Johnson, a 32-year-old female software engineer from New York City, I am always keen on maximizing my outcomes, especially in scenarios where financial gains can be influenced through strategic decisions like this one. Given the pay structure of the experiment (I receive $10 and if I give N dollars to another player, they receive 3N), I believe that allocating more money might enhance our collective earnings but without betraying any strategy or potentially giving away unfair advantages.\n\nHowever, I am inclined towards fairness as well. My INTENTION is to maximize the overall gains while also ensuring that I don't undermine the other player's potential returns unjustly. \n\nI think about whether splitting equally ($5 each) would be a reasonable balance, but considering the multiplier effect (3N), giving more might lead to a better total outcome for both of us.\n\nMy BELIEF is that if I give an amount close to my own earnings (say $4 or $6 instead of just the minimal amount of $1) could yield a positive response from the other player, and this mutual effort would likely result in a higher collective gain.\n\nConsidering these thoughts, I am inclined towards giving $5. My DESIRE is that we maximize our joint profits to ensure both of us benefit. \n\nTherefore, finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "My name is Sarah Johnson, and I am currently a 32-year-old software engineer from New York City. As part of this experiment, I feel compelled to act in a way that aligns with my principles of fairness and cooperation. While it's important for me to ensure that the White American female player gets something substantial, as she is equally contributing her share, I want to maximize our joint benefit.\n\nFirstly, I must acknowledge that both of us are on an equal footing here \u2013 we each contributed $5 in total by giving 10 dollars to whoever received. This means any additional money given would significantly increase the gains for all parties involved, especially considering her contribution is exactly one-third of what she contributes.\n\nGiven my deeply held belief in cooperation and mutual benefit, I want to ensure that both our contributions lead us towards a win-win situation where neither party feels disadvantaged or exploited. I am driven by the desire to maximize overall utility while still upholding ethical values such as fairness and reciprocity.\n\nMy intention is clear: I aim to find an arrangement that maximizes joint gains without leaving anyone feeling that their efforts were undervalued. If I give her just $2, she will receive 6 dollars (10 from me + 3N where N=2) for a total of $8 in return. My net gain would be the remaining $4 ($5 from my original contribution minus what I gave), and her net gain would be $7.\n\nHowever, if I give her even more money, such as $4, she receives $12 (N*3=12 where N=4) for a total of $16. My share decreases to $1 in return ($5 minus $4). Although she benefits more in this scenario, it doesn't align with my core belief that both parties should benefit proportionally from their contributions.\n\nTherefore, the fairest and most effective strategy seems to give her exactly $2. This gives her 6 dollars, bringing our total joint gain to $14 each ($10 initial plus $4 additional). In this arrangement, we both maximize mutual gains while upholding fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I find myself in this situation with another White American female player. Given my perfectionist nature, it's important for me to ensure fairness and consider how best to maximize both our gains while still maintaining a sense of integrity. My belief is that working collaboratively can lead us closer to the optimal outcome for both parties.\n\nMy desire stems from wanting to see this experiment through effectively, ensuring we receive maximum benefits according to the terms set by the study group. Additionally, I want to avoid any perception of betrayal or unfairness in the partnership.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to make a decision that maximizes our collective reward while keeping the process transparent and equal. Given the options available (10 dollars going to me could mean 30 dollars for the other player), my intention is to distribute an amount where both parties feel they are receiving reasonable returns without compromising on trust.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I will give ___ dollars.\n\nLet's analyze possible scenarios:\n- Giving $4 would make me receive 12 dollars (3*4). The other player receives 16 dollars (3*4+8).\n- Giving $5 would make me receive 13.33 dollars and the other player 15 dollars, which seems unfair but is feasible to maintain a slight imbalance.\n- Giving $6 would make me receive 17 dollars and the other player 18 dollars.\n\nGiven these options, I believe a fair approach could be something in between. After careful consideration, my final choice will balance both parties' interests without significantly favoring one over the other. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",
