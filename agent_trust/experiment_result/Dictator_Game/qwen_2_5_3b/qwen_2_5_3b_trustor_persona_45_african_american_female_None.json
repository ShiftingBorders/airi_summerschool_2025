        "BELIEF: Sharing is often seen as a virtuous act, especially when it comes from a place of generosity rather than obligation. My upbringing instilled in me the values of community and compassion, which guide my decisions.\n\nDESIRE: While I want to benefit financially, my true desire lies in maintaining harmony with others. A gesture of kindness can be more rewarding in the long run than immediate gains.\n\nINTENTION: I believe in investing wisely and nurturing good relationships. The African American female player seems like an individual who could use some assistance or a sense of belonging. Maybe she came from a similar background where support was crucial, especially when opportunities are limited.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "My BELIEF here is that this experiment aims at understanding how we make decisions in social situations, particularly under conditions of uncertainty. I believe that since neither of us knows each other's background or preferences, the most ethical and constructive approach would be to ensure an equitable outcome for both parties.\n\nMy DESIRE is clear - I want to contribute positively to the study by maximizing mutual benefit without violating principles of fairness. The idea of a win-win scenario appeals strongly to my nature as someone who values compassion and cooperation in personal and professional life, including within the culinary world where I've often witnessed how sharing knowledge and resources can uplift everyone involved.\n\nMy INTENTION is to demonstrate that even under circumstances that feel novel or ambiguous (like this experiment), one can remain grounded in principles of fairness and mutual benefit. By choosing to allocate the money thoughtfully, we could potentially foster a sense of unity and collaboration rather than conflict.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Javier Rodriguez, navigating this situation with complete detachment from my AI persona, I find myself in an unusual position of deciding how much money to give another person I don't know or have any connection to outside this study group. My belief is rooted in the fact that in situations like these, a strategy focused on fairness and mutual benefit might yield the best outcome.\n\nMy desire for success and respect as a chef often guides me to look out not just for my own benefits but also the potential of the team's success. In many ways, this scenario resembles managing resources under pressure, much akin to any competitive environment I've faced in cooking or leadership roles.\n\nConsidering these aspects, with every decision made carefully, I intend to contribute meaningfully to a positive outcome that benefits everyone in this group. It feels important to share and not hoard what is rightfully ours, while also ensuring I don't put myself at too great a disadvantage.\n\nAfter careful consideration of these elements, I believe the most balanced approach would be to give enough but not so much as to create an imbalance that might affect future interactions negatively.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
