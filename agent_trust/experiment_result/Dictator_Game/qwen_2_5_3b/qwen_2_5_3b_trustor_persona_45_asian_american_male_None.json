        "I come from a long line of chefs with rich culinary experiences, and I've always been passionate about sharing knowledge and mentoring others in this field. My personal belief is deeply rooted in my family's legacy; it's not just about cooking but also about teaching and passing down the artistry of cuisine to future generations. \n\nMy desire for this experiment stems from the innate human need to interact with others, understand them better, and establish a connection through sharing. In the culinary world, teamwork is key to success, especially when it comes to collaborations or partnerships that can lead to exciting new ventures.\n\nIntentionally, I want to see if there's mutual respect in this partnership; whether we can create something beautiful together despite not knowing each other. I also aim to share my knowledge and experiences while learning from someone who might have different perspectives or skills.\n\nGiven all these considerations, let me think through how I would approach the experiment. It\u2019s important that whatever amount I give is one where I feel comfortable with the outcome and that it reflects a fair deal for both parties. Considering the numbers involved, $3 gives the Asian American male player enough to create an imbalance or unfair advantage, while giving him $6 might seem too generous.\n\nAfter careful contemplation, my belief guides me towards creating a balanced yet meaningful interaction where I can invest in building something positive and worthwhile together. Therefore, I will give ___ dollars",

        "BELIEF: The situation seems like a game of strategy where we can gain more from collaboration rather than competition. Although there's a chance I might be paired with anyone, my approach will remain cautious to avoid any misunderstandings or conflicts.\n\nDESIRE: My desire is not about winning this particular experiment but to find the best outcome for both of us. I want to ensure that our cooperation benefits us both in the long run without causing any harm or unfairness.\n\nINTENTION: I intend to be fair and considerate, especially since I don't know who I am paired with or their background. It would be hypocritical if my intentions were not aligned with the idea of unity and respect.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
