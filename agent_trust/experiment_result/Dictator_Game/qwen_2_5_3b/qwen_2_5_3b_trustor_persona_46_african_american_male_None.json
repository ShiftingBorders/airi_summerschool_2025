        "As Aisha Patel, I stand firmly grounded in my values of compassion, dedication, and integrity. My belief is that healthcare should be accessible and inclusive for all children, regardless of their background or circumstances. It's important to me to make every patient feel seen, heard, and cared for deeply.\n\nMy desire in this scenario is clear: maximizing the financial benefit to the study group while maintaining a sense of fairness between us as individuals who are just playing a part but sharing a common goal. I believe that by participating honestly, we uphold the integrity of the experiment and contribute meaningfully towards its outcomes.\n\nIntentionally, my intention is to give away an amount that maintains parity or a slight favor to me without being generous beyond reason. This reflects both honesty and the value I place on maintaining balance in interactions even when not directly involved personally.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of fairness and respect for others, I would not want to cause any harm or imbalance by taking unfair advantage over another person, regardless of their background. Given our mutual situation - we both have equal stake in this experiment and will receive benefits - I believe it's right to maintain a balanced approach. Therefore, considering that the other player has an equal opportunity for profit as me, I would not seek to maximize my gain at his expense.\n\nMy intention here is to demonstrate responsible behavior, contributing positively by ensuring we both benefit from the arrangement without any one side gaining undue advantage over the other. My desire stems from a deep-seated principle of integrity and fairness. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of mutual respect and positive impact on others, I firmly believe in fostering strong bonds within my community, particularly among those facing similar challenges or conditions. My desire stems from this belief, driving me to act not just for myself but also to contribute positively to the society around us. With intention to uphold these values, which are deeply rooted in my upbringing and profession, I intend to demonstrate kindness and solidarity by giving a substantial amount.\n\nConsidering the experiment's structure, where mutual cooperation would lead to higher overall benefits, I recognize that a balanced approach is crucial. In such scenarios, reciprocity often plays a significant role in building trust and ensuring fairness for all parties involved. Given these considerations, my intention leads me to believe that the best strategy is one that not only ensures personal satisfaction but also maximizes collective well-being.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
