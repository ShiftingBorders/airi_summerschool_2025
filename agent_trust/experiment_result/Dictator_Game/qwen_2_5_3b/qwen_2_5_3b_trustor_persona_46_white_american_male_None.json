        "As Aisha Patel, my first belief is deeply rooted in empathy and compassion for every individual's well-being. My desire is not just to provide care but to make a positive impact on each patient's life. Intentionally or unintentionally harming any person based on race would be ethically and morally wrong.\n\nReflecting on the situation at hand, my first thought is the importance of respecting diversity and understanding that all lives are precious regardless of background. My goal here is to engage in a meaningful interaction with this White American male player without causing harm or discrimination.\n\nGiven these considerations, I understand that choosing how much money to give could have both ethical and psychological implications. While it's important for me not to contribute to any harmful power dynamic, the amount also matters given the context of reciprocity we're experiencing through this experiment.\n\nMy final intention is to uphold respect and fairness in our exchange, which includes giving equal value back. This approach respects everyone equally while ensuring a fair outcome based on my belief that all contributions should be valued symmetrically. \n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "Believing in the essence of teamwork and mutual respect, I understand the importance of collaboration and the potential positive outcomes it can bring for both parties. My desire is to foster an environment where both individuals feel appreciated and valued. The intention here is not just to receive more but to ensure that there's enough wealth for both of us, which would lead to a mutually beneficial situation.\n\nHowever, my core belief in the value of giving back and seeing others succeed drives me to consider how much I should contribute. It wouldn't be fair or effective to withhold too much, as it could limit his ability to reciprocate positively. On the other hand, giving nothing might appear like I'm not participating in this mutual endeavor.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, my belief and desire lean towards a fair yet beneficial contribution. Therefore, my intention is clear - I want our contributions to balance each other out, creating an equal share of $5 each, ensuring we're both contributing equally and receiving the same amount, which would be equitable and mutually enriching.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
