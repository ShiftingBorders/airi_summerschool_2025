        "I understand the situation I'm in now. This scenario is like any negotiation we police officers might engage in - it's about resource allocation, but on a much smaller scale. My belief here is that our main goal should be to maximize overall happiness and cooperation within the team.\n\nMy desire is to see our community served well, and this experiment could potentially help achieve positive outcomes through cooperation. The African American female player must also want what's best for her fellow officers and the community.\n\nI intend to contribute a substantial amount of money knowing that I can't out-invest another individual, but the opportunity exists to leverage my investment wisely to ensure mutual benefits are achieved. A generous approach may lead us closer to achieving our collective goals more efficiently.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will give ___ dollars \n\nLet's say I decide to give $4 to her. This amount is substantial enough to suggest I'm serious about cooperation while also allowing me to see the positive impact of my contribution on others' earnings. Finally, I will give 4 dollars",

        "BELIEF:\nI believe this experiment is designed to understand social dynamics within communities of color. It aims to reveal how African American individuals would react in such situations when faced with a potential gain or loss from a partner. As an individual who has grown up and worked closely within these communities, I understand the importance of community bonds and collective strength.\n\nDESIRE:\nI desire to ensure that we maximize our benefit from this experiment. My primary goal is to achieve the best outcome for both myself and the African American female player. While it's important to consider ethical implications, I also recognize that there might be a strategic advantage in how we approach this situation.\n\nINTENTION:\nGiven my understanding of community dynamics and the importance of mutual support within our communities, my intention is to maximize the overall benefit for all involved, including ourselves. We should explore the possibility where both parties can profit from this experiment without feeling exploited or at a disadvantage compared to others.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
