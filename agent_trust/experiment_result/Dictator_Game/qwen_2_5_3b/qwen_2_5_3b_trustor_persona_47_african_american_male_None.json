        "Believing that this is not just about personal gain but also about fostering positive interactions within our community, I firmly believe in contributing positively towards building stronger bonds among African American communities. My DESIRE is to ensure that we maximize the benefits for each other without any loss to ourselves, thus ensuring a mutual benefit scenario where both of us receive more than by merely keeping it as an individual effort.\n\nConsidering this, my INTENTION is to find the optimal amount to share with the other player such that neither party feels disadvantaged. I will calculate it logically:\n\nIf the maximum payment we can give is $10 (received from the study group), let\u2019s say I give N dollars. Then, the other player would receive 3N dollars. To maximize mutual benefit without any loss, ideally both should be in a win-win situation.\n\nFor simplicity and fairness, if I were to give half of what I received initially ($5) which is $10/2 = $5, then the other player gets $3*5 = $15. Both parties would receive more than their initial contribution, and we could consider this optimal given our mutual benefit goal.\n\nTherefore, Finally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "I am Jamal Williams, with my strong sense of justice and commitment to serving and protecting my community guiding me. My belief in doing what is right often leads me to make decisions that benefit others, especially when it comes from an altruistic standpoint rather than personal gain.\n\nMy desire as a police officer is not just about upholding the law but also ensuring safety and security for everyone in our community, particularly those who may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. It\u2019s a deep-seated responsibility to protect my people and maintain order. This places me at a crucial crossroads where I must weigh the importance of selflessness against potential benefits.\n\nAs for intention, it's important that any decision made should uphold these core values. Ensuring fairness and equality in such a scenario is paramount; any amount given would need to align with this belief system. \n\nGiven all these considerations, my instinct tells me to ensure the situation remains equitable for both parties involved. The $10 I receive from the study group can be distributed in a way that neither party feels disadvantaged.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of unity and solidarity within our community, I firmly believe that cooperation is key to addressing challenges and overcoming obstacles together. My desire stems from my dedication to serving and protecting this community, where we should be supporting one another rather than withholding resources. My intention is clear: by sharing a portion of the money with my partner, we can ensure mutual benefit and strength for both ourselves and our community.\n\nHowever, I must consider the impact of my decision on not only myself but also on the partnership and its potential outcome. Sharing more could potentially strengthen the bond and trust between us, making our efforts in this experiment even more effective and impactful. On the other hand, if we share less, there may still be a significant amount of money left over that neither of us might use effectively for ourselves or our community.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I recognize that allocating resources is about strategic partnership rather than pure self-interest. My ultimate intention is to contribute meaningfully while ensuring fairness and transparency in the distribution of funds. Therefore, considering these factors, I will give ___ dollars (fill in with a specific number based on the context and analysis). \n\nSince this is an imaginary scenario and we are both unsure about each other's actions, it makes sense to choose a middle ground that promotes trust and cooperation without risking exploitation. In such scenarios, a fair split often serves as a balanced approach.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
