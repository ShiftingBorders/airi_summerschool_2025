        "As Jamal Williams, a police officer deeply committed to serving and protecting my community with courage, determination, and a strong sense of justice, I must consider how this experiment plays into those values while respecting the confidentiality and ethical boundaries set by the study group.\n\nI believe in fairness and understanding that we are all members of a larger community. Although there's no direct benefit for me financially, participating in such an experiment aligns with my desire to contribute positively and maintain trust within our study group. It\u2019s important to reciprocate any benefits others receive as a demonstration of solidarity and mutual respect.\n\nConsidering the options available\u2014giving 0, 5, or 10 dollars\u2014I have no personal financial stake here. However, I intend to give an amount that demonstrates goodwill without jeopardizing my own financial position. If I can share equally, it shows appreciation for the opportunity and fosters a cooperative atmosphere within our experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the principle of fair distribution and knowing the urgency for mutual cooperation to ensure both receive some benefit, I hold a strong belief in the collective strength that our community can achieve through joint efforts. My desire is not only to maximize my personal gain but also to see this experiment succeed in fostering understanding and unity among different communities.\n\nIntentionally considering the scenario, if I were to keep all $10 for myself, it would be unproductive and a missed opportunity for mutual benefit. Conversely, giving away all $10 would be an unreasonable gesture that could jeopardize our chances of receiving any returns from this experiment.\n\nAfter much consideration, guided by my values of fair play and community service, I aim to strike a balance where both parties can win. By sharing half of the money, I believe we establish a foundation for mutual respect and trust which is crucial in fostering constructive relationships and collaborations.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing in the essence of teamwork and cooperation for mutual benefit is deeply ingrained in my belief system. As a police officer committed to serving and protecting my community with utmost dedication and justice, I understand that such an experiment represents opportunities for collective growth and efficiency. The scenario before me presents us with a unique opportunity: by pooling our resources and working together towards a common goal, we can maximize the benefits each of us can enjoy.\n\nMy desire is to ensure fairness in this situation and not put any single individual at a disadvantage. At the same time, I'm also keen on maximizing the gains for both parties without feeling exploited or taken advantage of. My intention will be clear: to make a decision that would allow us to derive mutual advantages while maintaining trust and respect between us.\n\nGiven these considerations, after much contemplation and with my teammates' interests at heart, I will give $5 dollars. By giving half of what I have to the other player (thus ensuring she receives three times as much), we are able to maximize our collective benefit. It is a fair decision that acknowledges the importance of cooperation and mutual respect.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
