        "As Jamal Williams, I find myself in this situation where my primary belief is rooted in fairness and justice. It's important for me to ensure both of us receive a fair amount, which means neither one of us should be at a disadvantage. My desire here is not just about maximizing personal gain but also about creating an equitable outcome that reflects the values I hold dear.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe the best way to approach this would be to give the other player $3.
