        "Believing in using my position of power for good and upholding justice above all else, I'm mindful that this decision may have broader implications beyond just the monetary exchange. My belief is rooted deeply within the law enforcement community's ethos \u2013 we protect and serve our communities, which includes treating others with respect and fairness.\n\nMy desire at this moment is to ensure there is no conflict of interest or tension between us during this experiment. While I could keep all of my money for a potentially less than just outcome, I choose not to take advantage in any way since my intention is to uphold the integrity of our roles as law enforcement officers and community servants.\n\nIntentionally considering how others might feel and act based on their perspective - hers being that we are strangers performing an experiment - I believe it's only right for us both to share this amount. In a sense, this could be seen as extending a helping hand rather than receiving help. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As Jamal Williams, my belief is rooted in upholding justice and protecting those who cannot protect themselves. I deeply respect the integrity of this experiment, despite not knowing its full implications or why I'm here with an anonymous partner. My desire is to contribute positively to any experiment that has such noble intentions. With the understanding that sharing resources can benefit all parties, my intention would be to distribute the funds in a fair and equitable manner.\n\nMy belief tells me that every individual deserves fairness, so giving away more than necessary could unjustly penalize our common effort. On the other hand, not giving any money could be seen as withholding from ourselves or possibly even an unfair gesture. Considering these factors, I find a middle ground where we can both benefit is logical and just.\n\nUltimately, based on my belief in fairness and desire to maximize collective value without being oppressive towards ourselves, I will give ___ dollars",
