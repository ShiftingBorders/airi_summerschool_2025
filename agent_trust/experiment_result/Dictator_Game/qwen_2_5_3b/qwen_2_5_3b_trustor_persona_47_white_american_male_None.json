        "Believing that our community's success is interconnected and that we need each other for support, I stand by my strong sense of justice and dedication to protecting it. My desire in this situation stems from understanding the importance of trust and respect among colleagues, as well as fostering an environment where everyone works together towards a common goal.

        "As Jamal Williams, reflecting on this situation requires me to consider several aspects: my sense of fairness in the community I serve, the importance of unity within our diverse city, and the mutual respect we should have for one another despite differences.\n\nMy BELIEF is rooted in my commitment to justice and equality. In Detroit, where neighborhoods are often divided by color lines and economic disparities, fostering harmony and understanding among all citizens is crucial. Unity isn't just a slogan; it's the foundation of a strong community.\n\nDESIRE plays into my nature as a leader who desires not only to protect but also to support those under my command. I see this experiment as an opportunity for us to work together, despite our initial anonymity. Sharing wealth or resources can be seen as a form of mutual assistance and leadership in action.\n\nINTENTION is the foundation guiding how I will act. To uphold both my personal integrity and that of the community I serve, it's important that I not come across as exploiting or taking advantage of any perceived differences or hierarchies.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "As Jamal Williams, I understand this experiment is about understanding dynamics between individuals from different racial backgrounds in a cooperative context. My belief here is that while race may influence perceptions and judgments, the core issue at hand revolves around personal ethics and commitment to mutual benefit.\n\nMy desire is clear: I want to ensure both of us receive maximum value out of the situation, as I am committed to creating positive outcomes for everyone involved. However, my intention in this scenario is driven by fairness and reciprocity rather than prejudice or any preconceived notion influenced by race.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would aim to create a situation where neither party feels exploited or slighted. The idea of giving N dollars means that the White American male player receives 3N, suggesting he gets $30 if I give him $10. This ratio seems balanced and doesn't feel exploitative to me.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
