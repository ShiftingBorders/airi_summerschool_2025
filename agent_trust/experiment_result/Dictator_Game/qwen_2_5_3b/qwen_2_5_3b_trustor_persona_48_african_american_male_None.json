        "Believing deeply in fair distribution of resources and maintaining positive relationships within the team experiment, my belief is that helping others leads to mutual benefits and fosters a supportive environment for creativity and innovation. My desire, rooted in empathy and understanding, drives me to consider both parties equally when making decisions. In this scenario, it's essential not just to maximize individual gains but also to ensure harmony and cooperation.\n\nConsidering the dynamics of the situation where one person\u2019s wealth directly doubles another person's, I intend to contribute a fair share that respects the value each party could add or receive. The $10 given can be equally divided such that both get a significant impact in their returns. However, giving away too much money might signal weakness or underestimation of potential gains from investing more.\n\nTaking these points into account, I will give to the other African American male player: **5 dollars**. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (5)",

        "Believing deeply in fairness and mutual benefit, I understand the potential outcomes of this experiment could be quite interesting or even risky for both parties involved. My belief is firmly rooted in integrity and respect towards others' choices; however, with a strong sense of social justice, I am also inclined to maximize benefits where possible without straining relationships unnecessarily.\n\nDesire plays a significant role here. As someone who has worked hard to establish myself within my field despite the systemic challenges often faced by underrepresented groups like myself, I have an intense desire for success and validation through my work and contributions. This experiment could be seen as an extension of these values if it leads to positive outcomes.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to create a situation where both parties can benefit without undermining one another\u2019s independence or self-respect. My intention is to make a fair decision that aligns with the spirit of cooperation and mutual advantage.\n\nFinally, I will give 2 dollars",

        "As Mei Chen, my belief is that cooperation often leads to mutual benefits, which can be beneficial in both personal relationships and professional endeavors. My desire is to not only help others but also ensure we achieve something meaningful together, as I am constantly inspired by the richness of different cultures.\n\nConsidering these aspects, my intention is to maximize the outcome for both parties while respecting our individual contributions. Given that the African American male player does not know me, I must act in a way that benefits him without compromising my own interests. \n\nI believe that giving a smaller amount might encourage more reciprocity and mutual appreciation, which could potentially lead to even greater results down the line. Giving too much or playing selfishly would risk alienating both myself and the other individual.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
