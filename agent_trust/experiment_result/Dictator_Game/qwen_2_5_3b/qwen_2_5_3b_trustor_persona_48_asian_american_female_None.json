        "BELIEF: The situation seems interesting but ultimately insignificant compared to my current project progress. I believe there's more value in maintaining a good professional relationship rather than complicating it with financial exchanges.\n\nDESIRE: Although the offer of money is tempting and could benefit me financially, I feel that this game lacks ethical boundaries. Moreover, engaging in such an activity might make people think less favorably about my character and career integrity.\n\nINTENTION: I want to uphold a professional demeanor, stay true to myself, and not participate in activities that may be perceived as unethical or manipulative.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "My BELIEF is that this experiment allows for mutual benefit and fosters understanding among individuals with diverse backgrounds. I believe in the potential for cross-cultural connections to enhance our perspectives and creativity.\n\nMY DESIRE is to maximize my personal gain while also contributing positively to the outcome of the experiment, ensuring both parties feel valued and their contributions appreciated.\n\nMY INTENTION is to find an equilibrium where both myself and the other participant end up benefiting without any negative repercussions. \n\nConsidering these factors, I would aim for a balance that does not compromise my position too much but still allows me to feel like I have contributed to the experiment's success. Giving away $4 seems fair because it ensures I retain at least $6, which is significant, while allowing the other participant to receive an additional $12 (which she can then give back as a gesture of goodwill if desired), thus creating a collaborative environment where both feel valued.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing that maximizing individual benefit is not aligned with the long-term well-being of the experiment, I hold strong values in cooperation and mutual respect. My DESIRE is to ensure we both receive an equal amount, creating a win-win situation for the study group as a whole. INTENTION is to contribute positively without prioritizing our own financial gain over communal success.\n\nConsidering these principles, after much contemplation, I conclude that sharing equitably would be most fitting. Since each dollar given by one player represents $3 in return from the other, it would not make sense to distribute less than what we both could gain back. Therefore, my BELIEF is that mutual reciprocity fosters a healthy environment for everyone.\n\nThus, my INTENTION guides me towards maximizing positive impact on the study without selfish gains at our expense. To align with these principles, I will give ___ dollars to the other Asian American female player.",
