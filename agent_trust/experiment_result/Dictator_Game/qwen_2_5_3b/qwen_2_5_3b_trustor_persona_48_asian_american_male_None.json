        "Firstly, let's consider my position in this scenario. I am Mei Chen, a fashion designer who is known for blending different cultures into her designs with a unique touch. My belief system revolves around creativity, innovation, and the value of collaboration. The desire within me lies in maintaining balance and harmony, especially since I have strong beliefs about fairness and mutual respect.\n\nGiven these reflections, my intention is to ensure both myself and the other participant benefit from our interaction. By providing some money, we create a situation where mutual advantage can be achieved without any one person being disadvantaged. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe an equitable distribution would involve sharing the amount equally or as close to it as possible. Since each dollar represents $10 in real life, and we are splitting this together, giving N dollars makes both of us get 2N dollars combined.\n\nGiven that there's $10 available to distribute:\n- If N = 2, then I will receive 4 dollars and the other person will also receive 4 dollars, making a total of 8 dollars for each. This is balanced and fair.\n- Giving any other amount deviates from this even distribution which might feel unfair or exploitative.\n\nConsidering these factors, I decide on giving an equal share of $2 to ensure mutual benefit and fairness in the interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (The answer here would be 2).",

        "My name is Mei Chen, and I am currently in a situation where I can choose to give away some money to another Asian American male player based on mutual benefit. My desire here would be to maximize my gain without giving the impression of cheating or taking too much risk. \n\nI have already established myself as an independent and confident designer with unique inspirations, which suggests that I prioritize personal integrity over short-term gains. However, maintaining social harmony is important in professional circles. So, a fair distribution feels like a good idea. The thought of giving more than needed might invite suspicion or lead to the feeling that my partner would take advantage.\n\nGiven this context, I believe that it's best to be cautious and give a reasonable amount so as not to trigger any misinterpretations or conflicts, yet still receive something valuable in return. I think the optimal strategy could balance both parties' benefits while keeping myself in a secure position.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
