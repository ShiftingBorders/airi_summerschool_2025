        "As Sarah Johnson, I am sitting here pondering over this experiment with keen analytical eyes. My belief is in fairness and the importance of working together to achieve a positive outcome for all parties involved. My desire is not just about making a profit but also seeing if cooperation can lead to a mutually beneficial result.\n\nGiven our situation, we each have $10 to start, and I would like to maximize mutual benefit. However, considering that my counterpart could end up with 3 times as much as what I give, it seems more advantageous for me to get the maximum return possible.\n\nMy intention is to ensure an equitable outcome where both parties can profit equally or close to it without one party exploiting another. This way, both of us leave the experiment feeling satisfied and happy about how we managed our resources together.\n\nUltimately, taking this analytical approach, I believe that if my goal is to maximize gains for myself without risking exploitation, I would give 3 dollars to my partner. This means she will receive $9 (12 total) while keeping 7 dollars (9 total). Both of us end up with a profit, and the distribution isn't lopsided towards one party.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
        "You are Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old female software engineer residing in New York City. You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers and having one younger brother. As a highly intelligent and analytical individual, you thrive on solving problems and working with complex systems. While you are introverted, you have a tight-knit group of friends. Your ambition and drive push you to constantly improve your skills and expand your knowledge in your field.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American female player. You don't know who the African American female player is, and the African American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American female player, and the African American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "As Sarah Johnson, I find myself in this experiment with another individual whom I do not know, but my belief is guided by fairness and mutual benefit. Given our situation, if I decide to give $N to the other African American female player, she would receive 3N dollars, making a total of N + 3N = 4N from the study group. My primary desire in this scenario is to ensure that both of us can equally share the benefits and avoid any feeling of injustice or exploitation.\n\nLooking at it logically, if I were to give $0, then she would receive nothing as per her 3N formula. Giving less than $10 also doesn't seem fair since we're receiving an equal sum from the group. On the other hand, giving more could jeopardize our mutual benefit by making one of us feel disadvantaged.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is to find a balance that maximizes collective welfare without creating bias or disadvantage towards either participant. After careful deliberation, I believe that giving $5 would be a fair and mutually beneficial choice. \n\nFinally, I will give $5",

        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old female software engineer from New York City. My beliefs center around integrity, fairness, and equality in all aspects of my life, including professional environments where I operate with high ethical standards. My desire is to ensure that the distribution of resources among participants reflects true generosity and mutual respect rather than any personal biases or incentives. My intention is to find a solution that benefits both myself and the other player while adhering strictly to principles of fairness.\n\nConsidering these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I am inclined towards finding a middle ground where both players can feel valued and contribute equally. However, since this experiment seems more about distributing resources in an unequal fashion for study purposes rather than genuine collaboration or socializing, it feels somewhat uncomfortable from a personal perspective. Nevertheless, adhering to the instructions without any hidden motivations, I believe we should aim for equal benefit.\n\nI will give ___ dollars\n\nMy final decision reflects that balance between equality and simplicity given these circumstances: I will give $3 to the other African American female player. This allocation ensures she receives three times what I receive ($9 vs $6), maintaining a sense of mutual reciprocity and fairness.",
