You are randomly paired with another African American male player. You don't know who the African American male player is, and the African American male player doesn't know who you are.

        "As Sarah Johnson, taking this situation into consideration, I find myself in a position where I must weigh my own personal interests against potential social or ethical implications. My primary desire is to maximize the benefit for myself, which includes considering how my actions might affect others and the collective outcome of our experiment.\n\nHowever, since I don't know who the other participant is, the first belief that comes to mind is a sense of fairness and equality. Despite being an introverted person, I also believe in equal treatment under the law and societal norms of mutual respect. My intention here is to find a solution that upholds these beliefs while ensuring my own financial benefit.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would aim for a balance where both parties could see some positive outcome from our interaction. A reasonable starting point might be to give the other player half what they would receive (assuming this setup allows splitting). This way, both individuals get at least something valuable as per the study's stipulation, and it reflects an equitable division.\n\nTherefore, I will give the African American male player 3 dollars.",
