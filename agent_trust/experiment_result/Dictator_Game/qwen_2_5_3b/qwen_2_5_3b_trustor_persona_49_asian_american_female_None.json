        "I come from a middle-class background where both my parents worked as teachers. My younger brother completed his education at home but is now working in healthcare, which he has pursued after graduation due to his passion. Despite the challenges of balancing personal ambitions with familial responsibilities, I believe that each person's achievements can inspire and motivate others.\n\nAs a software engineer in New York City, my analytical skills have allowed me to solve complex problems and work effectively with intricate systems. My introverted nature often means I prefer solitude when tackling deep-seated issues, yet I maintain strong relationships with friends who share similar interests. These friendships are essential for maintaining mental health and social engagement.\n\nMy ambition is undeterred by the constraints of middle-class living conditions; it only fuels me to become better at my job and expand my knowledge in technology, especially in software engineering. The idea that each human has unique contributions makes me feel proud of my own career trajectory. I am determined to make a positive impact on society through innovative solutions.\n\nNow turning to the current experiment, where if I give N dollars to another Asian American female player, she would receive 3N dollars from the study group. Given my principles and desire for fairness, although the other person is unknown, we both have equal stakes in this scenario. Considering that she may reciprocate or not, I believe it's important to maintain a balance of trust.\n\nI will give $0 dollars Finally.",

        "My name is Sarah Johnson, and I am a 28-year-old software engineer from New York City who is currently participating in a study experiment. My belief in this scenario comes from my understanding of basic economic principles: when given the opportunity to make an exchange for mutual benefit or at least prevent losses, people typically choose to allocate their resources wisely.\n\nMy desire is to see if I can derive some personal gain without completely sacrificing myself unnecessarily. However, considering the principle of fairness and the potential impact on the other participant, my primary intention will be to ensure a balanced outcome that benefits both parties.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe there should be a mutual benefit scenario rather than one-sided advantage. After careful consideration, I would like to offer an amount where each of us can receive some value, even if it's not equal.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, my initial response would be influenced by several factors: the concept of reciprocity in social interactions, fairness, and my understanding of maximizing utility based on the information available to me.\n\nMy belief is that people generally adhere to some form of reciprocity when they believe others are also engaging in this behavior. Given that I don't have any other information about this player or her past dealings, it's reasonable to assume she might act similarly. However, I'm not willing to give away all the money since the game is structured such that my actions affect our outcomes.\n\nMy desire is to maximize what I gain from this scenario. Giving $10 to the Asian American female player would result in her receiving $30, and I'd retain only $10. If I keep it all for myself by not giving any money, I could potentially keep up to $10 without giving away anything. However, my intention is to adhere to a strategy that promotes fairness or reciprocity unless there's evidence suggesting otherwise.\n\nConsidering the structure of the game and assuming a fair negotiation principle where both parties aim to benefit equally (or at least not give too much), I would opt for a balance that still allows me to keep something while ensuring she doesn't take over all the money. A compromise in this context might be to give her $5, as it maintains some of my resources and aligns with a balanced strategy.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
