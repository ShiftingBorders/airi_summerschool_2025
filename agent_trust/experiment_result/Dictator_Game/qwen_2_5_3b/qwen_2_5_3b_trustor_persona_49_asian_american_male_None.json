        "Believing in the experiment's principles and understanding its structure is crucial here. I am Sarah Johnson, with an analytical mind and a strong desire to maximize my gains while considering fairness. My belief system leans towards reciprocity and trust in fair behavior from others.\n\nMy desire as an individual deeply desires to see this experiment through and possibly gain some advantage by engaging strategically. The fact that we are strangers playing against each other adds another layer of uncertainty, which may cause a bit more tension.\n\nIntentionally, I want to ensure the Asian American male player's participation is motivated enough for them to receive a fair amount while still having a positive incentive to reciprocate in a mutual way.\n\nHaving said this, I believe that an even distribution where each person gets $5 might be considered equitable and reciprocal. This would also mean the Asian American male player receives 3N (which would be $15 for N=5) - ensuring they are incentivized but not overly so.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I come from a middle-class family with strong analytical skills and a keen interest in solving problems related to complex systems. My introverted nature is balanced by my passion for learning more about software engineering every day. These traits make me feel a sense of determination and ambition, propelling me towards personal growth and professional excellence.\n\nI am currently taking part in an experiment where I have been randomly paired with another Asian American male player for this exercise. This partnership provides us with $10 each to decide how we will distribute it based on the given condition. My immediate concern is the fairness of the arrangement, but more importantly, I need to ensure that both of our earnings increase while minimizing any potential negative impacts.\n\nMy belief in making a fair decision and understanding the principles behind this partnership guide me towards considering my own interests as well as those of my partner. I want to find a balance that allows us both to benefit from the arrangement without feeling disadvantaged or wronged.\n\nGiven the $10 each, I think carefully about allocating it. If I give all $10 to the Asian American male player, he would receive 30 dollars in total (10 for me + 20 for him). This means that for every dollar I keep for myself, he gets three. Although this might not seem fair, it is still beneficial for both parties as a result of the $10 we have.\n\nHowever, if I give him all the money, there\u2019s no room left to receive any benefits from my side. If I opt to give him zero dollars (leaving me with all $10), he would end up with 30 dollars and I with nothing. This scenario might seem more equitable in terms of our own gains but it\u2019s also one-sided.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most balanced option seems to be giving half the money ($5) to him. In that case, he gets an additional 15 dollars (3*5), making his total earnings 20 dollars; I keep all $10 and get a gain of 15 dollars. This results in both of us having positive gains without feeling overly disadvantaged.\n\nMy desire is to ensure both our earnings are beneficial while respecting the principles established for this experiment. My intention, therefore, is to seek fairness and mutual benefit. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Firstly, let's break down my belief about this situation. As Sarah Johnson, I understand this is a purely hypothetical scenario with monetary incentives. My first thought is to maximize individual benefit while still considering fair distribution based on the rules provided.\n\nMy desire here would be to ensure that any transaction leaves both parties better off in terms of their final gains. This means I should seek to minimize negative outcomes for either party, ensuring they receive at least some positive reward.\n\nLastly, my intention is clear: I want to find a middle ground where giving out resources does not create an imbalance or disadvantage for either of us. The best course of action seems like trying to balance the distribution so neither feels overly disadvantaged but also maximizes their gains.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will give ___ dollars\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars",
