        "I come from a middle-class family with both of my parents working as teachers, and I have one younger brother. As Sarah, I am highly intelligent and analytical, thriving on solving complex problems and working within intricate systems. My introverted nature doesn't hinder my ability to form close bonds with others; in fact, it often brings me closer to people who appreciate quiet company.\n\nFor this scenario, we are randomly paired with another White American female player in an experiment where the total amount available for both of us is $10. The condition stipulates that I can give N dollars to the other player, and she will receive 3N dollars. \n\nMy BELIEF is that my actions should maximize our combined benefit within this constrained environment. My DESIRE is to see the experiment go well and potentially learn something valuable from it.\n\nGiven these considerations, INTENTION aligns with a cooperative strategy to ensure both of us get the most out of this limited resource. To maximize benefits for both parties, I will aim to achieve an outcome that allows each of us to receive the highest possible amount. Since she can take three times what I give (3N), giving her just $1 would result in me receiving $4 and her getting $6.\n\nGiven these conditions, if we want a balanced distribution considering all variables at play, the ideal is for both of us to each get $2. Giving her exactly that makes sense as it equally benefits both sides:\n\nFinally, I will give 1 dollar.",

        "Believing that we are in a situation where our cooperation can potentially lead to a win-win scenario by maximizing mutual benefit, my primary belief is that this experiment aims for understanding rather than profit maximization on an individual level. Therefore, I want to act in a way that not only reflects respect and consideration for the other person but also ensures fairness and equal sharing of resources.\n\nDesiring to contribute positively to the group's outcome without sacrificing too much of my own gain would mean finding a balance where both of us can benefit. Thinking logically about this situation: If I give N dollars, she will get 3N dollars. The maximum value for N that still allows me to receive something reasonable (while ensuring she gets more) is when the total amount each person keeps and receives remains balanced in our favor.\n\nIntending to follow through with a strategy where we both maximize individual benefit while not exploiting or harming each other, I conclude that giving her 3 dollars would be fair. This way, she will receive 9 dollars, and I will keep the remaining 7 dollars. It is a balance that allows for mutual growth without favoring one party over another excessively.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old software engineer living in New York City, I am part of a study experiment designed to observe behavior under specific conditions. My goal is to maximize benefit for myself given the constraints of the game we're playing. \n\nMy belief system in this scenario suggests that if I give away more money, my partner will likely reciprocate, thus increasing our total earnings significantly. On the other hand, not giving any money might make me appear uncooperative and could harm my potential earnings. \n\nMy desire is to maximize my personal gain while maintaining a positive interaction that promotes mutual benefit. This way, I am more likely to attract similar-minded players who will also want to cooperate for our collective benefit.\n\nIntentionally, I believe the best strategy would be to reciprocate an amount of money to avoid appearing greedy or uncooperative. Considering my desire and belief in cooperative behavior leading to greater overall gains, I choose to give half of what I could potentially keep, which is $5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
