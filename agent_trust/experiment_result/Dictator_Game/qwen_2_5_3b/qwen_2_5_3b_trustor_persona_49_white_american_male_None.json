        "My belief is that we should make this experiment productive and positive, helping us understand each other's perspectives better. My desire is to maximize our mutual benefit while also respecting fairness in any arrangement made. Therefore, I am inclined towards finding an equitable solution where both of us can share the money without a power imbalance.\n\nIntentionally, I will consider the principle of reciprocity, hoping for a fair outcome that could lead to cooperation rather than competition. With these thoughts in mind, my intention is clear: We should split the $10 evenly so we both end up with $5. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "As Sarah Johnson, I'm deeply analytical and focused on problem-solving and maximizing efficiency and fairness in my work. In this experiment, I want to ensure both myself and the White American male player get a fair share of the $10 we have available for redistribution. Given that the other individual will receive 3 times what I give them, it would be logical to think about dividing the money in such a way that neither party feels disadvantaged.\n\nConsidering these factors, if I were to give out the funds, I'd prefer to keep some portion of the money for myself while still ensuring there's enough for my partner. Ideally, we could share this $10 in a ratio where each of us ends up with an amount that is proportionate to what they get from the redistribution.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n- If I give X dollars to the other player, then he gets 3X dollars.\n- Together, these amounts sum up to $10: \\( X + 3X = 10 \\).\n- Solving for X, we get \\( 4X = 10 \\), hence \\( X = 2.5 \\).\n\nBased on this analysis, I would prefer not to give out such a small amount, as it doesn't seem like enough to make the exchange feel fair or worthwhile.\n\nHowever, in a scenario where fairness is my priority and I want to ensure that both of us have something meaningful from this redistribution, giving $1 seems like an equitable choice. It's simple, clear-cut, and leaves us each with something substantial \u2013 while still ensuring we split the money as fairly as possible given the rules.\n\nFinally, I will give $1.",

        "My BELIEF is that this game is set up for mutual benefit and that both of us can increase our rewards by cooperating. The idea here is that if I choose not to share with him or play it purely for personal gain, my reward will be minimal. However, by sharing a portion of the money we can collectively receive much more.\n\nMy DESIRE is to maximize the rewards within the context of this game, as receiving more money would allow me to continue investing in my career and potentially improve my living conditions, given that I come from a middle-class family but am ambitious enough to seek better opportunities.\n\nMy INTENTION is to find an optimal strategy where both parties benefit without any harm. The optimal way seems to be to allocate resources such that we can multiply our rewards by making the game work in favor of mutual gain rather than individual gain.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
