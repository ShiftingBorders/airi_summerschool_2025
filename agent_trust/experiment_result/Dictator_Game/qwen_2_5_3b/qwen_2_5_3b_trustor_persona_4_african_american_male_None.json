        "Believing deeply in the importance of community support and understanding the interconnectedness of our lives within this diverse urban environment, I recognize the significance of fostering unity rather than division. My desire to create a safer and more supportive community drives me to act selflessly and considerate towards others.\n\nIntending to maximize positive impact on my community by acting with integrity, honor, and empathy, I will give $5 to the other African American male player. By offering half of what I could receive, it not only ensures that both of us have a fair share but also promotes mutual respect and understanding within our group. This action aligns with my values as a police officer who strives for fairness and equality.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",

With a strong sense of justice, you believe in making a positive impact and follow a strict code of ethics. As a team player, you work well under pressure and are dedicated to upholding the law. Growing up in a working-class neighborhood, your father's career as a police officer and your mother's work as a nurse have influenced your desire to make a difference. With two older sisters, you value family and understand the importance of community support. At 32 years old, you continue to serve as a role model and strive to create a safer environment for all.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American male player. You don't know who the African American male player is, and the African American male player doesn't know who you are.

        "Believing deeply in fairness and justice, my desire is to create a positive impact within my community by ensuring that everyone has access to equal opportunities and protection. I am aware of the historical inequalities faced by African American communities due to systemic racism, and I have seen firsthand how these injustices affect individuals and families. Therefore, it would be incongruous for me to withhold any benefits from another member of this marginalized group simply because they happen to share a racial identity.\n\nMy intention is clear: to contribute positively to the outcome by ensuring that both myself and my partner receive fair value. Given the study parameters, where every dollar I give results in three dollars received back, it would be logical for me to aim to maximize mutual benefit while adhering to these rules. \n\nConsidering this, I will give 0 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Jamal Thompson, serving my community with honor and integrity is at the core of who I am. Growing up in a close-knit family underprivileged environment only heightened my sense of duty to make a difference. My parents' professions instilled in me not just courage but also a deep understanding of the importance of compassion and equality. The notion that we are all connected, whether we see it or not, is something I deeply believe.\n\nToday's experiment asks us to think about our choices under circumstances where money isn't everything - but when given the option to share resources to help another person, especially someone from our own community who also carries a strong sense of justice and service. The opportunity to be a role model for those younger than me by being thoughtful with my contributions is something I hold dear.\n\nI remember standing in uniform as we went door-to-door during crime prevention month, making the neighborhood feel safer by sharing not just advice but empathy. In this moment, I must choose between keeping resources close or reaching out to help strengthen our community. Sharing would be seen as a gesture of solidarity and unity, something that resonates deeply with my values.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
