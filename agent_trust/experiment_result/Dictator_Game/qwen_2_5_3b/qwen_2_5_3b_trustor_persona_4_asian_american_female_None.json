        "Believing deeply in justice and fairness, I understand the importance of maintaining balance and harmony within our community. As Jamal Thompson, dedicated to serving and protecting those who cannot protect themselves, my first thought is how this situation plays into upholding these values.\n\nMy DESIRE as a police officer is to create an environment where all members of society can live safely and with dignity. In times like these when I am paired randomly with someone else in our community, it becomes even more important to foster connections that build trust and mutual understanding.\n\nConsidering the scenario given, while there are mathematical calculations one could make, the ethical implications and potential for strengthening bonds within our diverse community outweigh any numbers. My INTENTION is to ensure we come out of this situation with a sense of goodwill and mutual respect, as these qualities will serve us well in real-world encounters where people's lives depend on trust.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the importance of fair treatment for everyone and upholding my commitment to justice, I find myself in this situation where I am forced to make a decision affecting another person's well-being. My belief system tells me that fairness is key, even if it means sacrificing a small amount personally. At the same time, I have a strong desire to ensure both parties are treated equally and fairly.\n\nIntentionally stepping out of my usual routine as a police officer, this scenario asks for a decision beyond just following codes or protocols. My initial thoughts lean towards giving some money away, not wanting to seem selfish in any way. However, considering the value system I hold dear - one that emphasizes equal treatment of all individuals and respect for others' autonomy - I feel compelled to give more.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars.",

        "Believing deeply in fairness and justice, I firmly believe that it is crucial for both parties to benefit from such an arrangement. My desire stems from understanding the importance of equality and mutual respect, especially in community settings where we strive to serve others. My intention is clear: to ensure a win-win scenario where both the police officer and the Asian American female player can feel valued and respected.\n\nHowever, I must consider the economic impact and fairness towards both parties. Giving more than N dollars could potentially harm the other person's financial situation or make it seem like there might be an unequal advantage. On the other hand, giving less than N dollars could result in one party feeling undervalued. \n\nAfter careful consideration and following my ethical beliefs as a public servant who strives for equitable treatment of all individuals, I believe that maintaining a balance is key.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
