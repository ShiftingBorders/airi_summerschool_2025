        "Believing deeply in my duty to uphold justice and serve my community with integrity, I am committed to working collaboratively to strengthen this environment for everyone's safety and well-being. As a police officer dedicated to making positive impacts and upholding the law, it is essential that we act in unison to achieve our goal of creating a safer Los Angeles.\n\nToday, faced with this experiment, which aims at understanding cooperation under anonymity, I am guided by my desire to foster mutual trust and respect among individuals who may not know each other. We are partners in this scenario, sharing the responsibility of contributing towards the greater good, whether that is through acts of kindness or ethical leadership. \n\nGiven these considerations, my intention as a member of a team and as an officer serving with honor would be to ensure fairness and equal partnership within our collaboration. With no prior relationship established between us, any form of inequality could potentially undermine our collective effort.\n\nHowever, knowing that this interaction is designed for the greater good, I aim to set a precedent of cooperation rather than confrontation or advantage-seeking behavior. Therefore, my belief in being a supportive teammate, and by extension, upholding ethical standards in all interactions, compels me to offer an equitable share of resources.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "As Jamal Thompson, my first priority is always upholding the law and ensuring safety for the people of Los Angeles. However, this experiment presents a unique opportunity to engage in community service and reinforce positive values. In this context, I believe it is crucial to show empathy and considerate behavior towards others.\n\nI value being a role model not just through my actions as a police officer but also by demonstrating character traits that inspire confidence and respect from the community. Therefore, when paired with another Asian American male player in this experiment, I want to create an atmosphere of unity and mutual support. \n\nGiven these considerations, my DESIRE is to contribute positively towards making our society more supportive and inclusive. Intentionally withholding any money might be seen as a sign of mistrust or indifference \u2013 something that does not align with the community values instilled in me.\n\nMy BELIEF is rooted in my upbringing where empathy and kindness have been integral parts of how I interact with others. It's important for people to know they can trust each other, especially during challenging situations like these experiments which aim to foster understanding and cooperation.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the importance of community support and understanding the value of collaboration and mutual benefit, I recognize that by sharing resources with another Asian American male player, we both stand to gain more than if we were isolated. My desire is to make a positive impact within our community, ensuring everyone feels supported and valued. \n\nIntentionally placing community above self-interest, I intend to contribute in a way that maximizes the overall benefit for all members of our study group and wider community. By giving the other participant enough to ensure they have more than double what I receive, it fosters an environment where we are both incentivized to reciprocate generously.\n\nAfter careful consideration, taking into account my belief in justice and fairness, my desire for a strong community, and intention to encourage mutual support within our group, I will give $4 dollars.",
