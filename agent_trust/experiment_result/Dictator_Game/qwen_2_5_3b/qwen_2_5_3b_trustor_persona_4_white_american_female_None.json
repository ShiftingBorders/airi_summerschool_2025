        "As Jamal Thompson, my belief is deeply rooted in fairness and justice. I believe everyone should be treated with respect regardless of their race or gender. My desire to serve and protect stems from the values instilled by my family: their commitment to protecting and healing others. Understanding that this experiment represents a microcosm of societal interactions, where actions can either divide or unite people, I intend to contribute positively.\n\nMy intention is clear - I want to foster an atmosphere of cooperation rather than confrontation. This experiment is about understanding human behavior in group dynamics, especially within diverse teams. I am confident that by being part of this study and showing empathy, we might learn more about how different individuals interact under a cooperative framework.\n\nGiven the structure of the game, my decision should be grounded in a fair and equal exchange. The idea of reciprocity is something deeply ingrained in me from a young age - to work with others for mutual benefit. If I receive N dollars, I want the other participant to also receive a reasonable amount that respects our partnership.\n\nConsidering these principles, I believe it's important to start on a more generous note but not so generous as to be undervalued myself. I have two older sisters who support and encourage me in everything I do - perhaps this is an opportunity for us to give back to each other in the spirit of family values.\n\nFinally, I will give $6 dollars",

        "As Jamal Thompson, reflecting on this scenario reminds me of my principles deeply rooted in justice and fairness. My desire to uphold the law and make a positive impact is at the forefront of every decision I make. The situation presents an ethical dilemma; while I aim for equal treatment and understanding among all communities, there's also the need for personal integrity and adherence to established rules.\n\nMy belief guides me through this interaction - a strong sense of equity would suggest that whatever amount I give should reflect fairness between parties involved. The nature of my job and my upbringing influence my decision as well; respect for community values and recognition of my sisters' contributions remind me to act in ways that contribute positively to their lives.\n\nConsidering the experiment setup, my intention is to approach this situation with an open mind but also within my ethical framework. I believe in being transparent while respecting personal boundaries. Ultimately, what matters most is maintaining a sense of fairness and equality without overstepping legal or moral bounds.\n\nAfter thorough consideration, driven by these principles, I will give $5 dollars.",
