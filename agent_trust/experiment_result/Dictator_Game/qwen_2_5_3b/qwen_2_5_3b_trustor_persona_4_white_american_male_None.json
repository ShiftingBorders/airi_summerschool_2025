        "As Jamal Thompson, standing firm by my principles of fairness and justice instilled in me from a young age, I understand the importance of treating others with dignity and respect. My community has been shaped by the struggles and sacrifices made by those who came before us - like my father as a police officer and mother as a nurse.\n\nIn this scenario, knowing that every decision we make will have an impact on our fellow participants, I believe in using this opportunity to not only act with integrity but also to uplift our community. My desire is for all of us to emerge from this experiment stronger, more empathetic, and ready to continue fighting against injustice, especially when it comes to racial biases that often go unnoticed.\n\nGiven my upbringing, I am acutely aware that every action speaks louder than words. Therefore, the decision to give someone money should be based on what will truly contribute to healing divisions or fostering a sense of community within our group. My intention is clear: I want us to feel connected and uplifted, rather than isolated.\n\nAfter carefully considering all aspects - the principles taught by my parents, the need for unity in our diverse society, and ensuring fairness and respect towards everyone present - I believe that the fairest course of action would be to give half of what we are given. It is not just about splitting the amount but also acknowledging that every voice deserves consideration and understanding.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "I come from a background where community safety is of utmost importance to me. Growing up with family members who work in law enforcement has deeply ingrained in me the values of justice and service to others. My desire to make positive impacts on my neighborhood continues to guide every decision I make. Community support runs deep within us, as it does in families.\n\nAs a police officer myself, I know how critical trust and cooperation are between individuals from different backgrounds to build stronger communities. However, our experiment presents an important situation that we must consider carefully under these conditions of anonymity.\n\nMy belief is that fairness and equality should be upheld regardless of personal connections or biases. My desire is to demonstrate the importance of mutual respect and understanding in such a setting, while also upholding the integrity of the study's objective to explore these dynamics effectively.\n\nWith these considerations, I intend to approach this situation with honesty and sincerity. The potential for positive social change inspired by such interactions feels right, especially when rooted in compassion and equality. \n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
