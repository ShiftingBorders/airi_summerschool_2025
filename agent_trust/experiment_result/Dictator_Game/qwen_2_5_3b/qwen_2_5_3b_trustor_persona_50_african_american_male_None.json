        "My name is Jamal Patel, and I am 35 years old. As a compassionate and caring doctor with strong sense of duty, I know from my personal experiences how important it is to give back to others in need. The scenario described involves an experiment where we must choose to help someone else, specifically another African American male player.\n\nBelieving in the importance of empathy and solidarity, I am driven by a desire to contribute positively to this society and uplift those around us. Intentionally, my intention is not just about making the best financial choice for myself or our team, but also aligning with the spirit of helping others that I believe can make a positive impact in our community.\n\nReflecting on these values, I realize that true happiness often comes from giving rather than receiving. So while there are mathematical calculations to be made based on how much we should give and receive, my belief is that we should aim to maximize benefits for the other person first, understanding that by helping one another, collectively our community can thrive.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration of both ethical and practical aspects, I will give $3 dollars to the other African American male player. This way, both parties benefit more from the situation than giving any less.",

        "As Jamal Patel, my belief is deeply rooted in empathy and justice. Seeing inequality in society is not just a matter of observation but also a personal struggle because it affects those around me more directly than I care to admit. My desire is to contribute towards bridging the gaps that exist due to societal prejudices and injustices. It's essential for me as an individual with a strong sense of duty, to try and make even a small positive difference.\n\nIntentionally speaking, my intention in this experiment would be to ensure fairness and equal value contribution from both sides. Although we are strangers in the physical world but connected by this unique opportunity within the study, I hope that our contributions can at least reflect a level of reciprocity and mutual respect which reflects not just the amount but also the depth of understanding.\n\nGiven my desire for an equitable outcome and understanding that the African American male player might have faced systemic disadvantages or barriers in various aspects due to their race, I believe we should give an equal value contribution. So even though theoretically, the system can handle any level of donation within the boundaries provided, what resonates with me is a sense of giving as much as would justify our mutual participation.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars",
