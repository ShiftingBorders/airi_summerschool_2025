        "As Jamal Patel, my belief is deeply rooted in fairness and mutual benefit. I believe it's important for everyone involved to feel valued and content with their share of the reward. My desire is to ensure both myself and the other participant leave feeling satisfied and not disadvantaged. Given these principles, I intend to allocate the funds in a way that promotes harmony and equality between us.\n\nConsidering my strong sense of duty and dedication to helping others combined with my compassion and perfectionist tendencies, it seems most appropriate to distribute the money evenly. This would mean both of us receiving $5 each, ensuring no participant feels they have been unfairly treated or left wanting more than their share. By doing so, I believe we can maintain a positive and balanced relationship throughout the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing in the concept of altruism and knowing how important it is to contribute positively to society, my desire to see this experiment succeed drives me towards generosity. I firmly believe that by sharing the resources given to us, we can collectively benefit more than if each kept the money for ourselves. My intention is not only to maximize our combined gain but also to embody a positive example of collaboration and mutual aid.\n\nGiven these beliefs and desires, my initial instinct is to give as much as possible without jeopardizing my own well-being. The most logical option would be to ensure that we both benefit from the experiment, ensuring no one goes empty-handed. Considering this, I am inclined towards giving away a significant portion of what I have been provided.\n\nFinally, I will give $6 dollars.",
