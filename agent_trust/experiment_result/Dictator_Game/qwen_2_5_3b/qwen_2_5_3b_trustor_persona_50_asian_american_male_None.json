        "Believing in contributing positively and making the best decision for both of us, my DESIRE is clear - I want this experiment to be a constructive learning experience, not just an economic game. My INTENTION is to act with compassion and fairness towards another fellow Asian American man. Therefore, even though we are strangers playing a game that can benefit only one player per round, the ethical choice should resonate more deeply.\n\nConsidering my BELIEF in mutual respect and understanding, I believe it would be unfair for me to expect nothing from the other player while they receive 3 times what I give. If I gave nothing at all, they might feel undervalued and that our collaboration is not reciprocal. On the flip side, giving them a small amount of $2 doesn't seem generous or fair either.\n\nI think my best approach would be to find an even balance that still feels decent and appreciates their participation. I also want to set a good example of cooperation rather than competition. After considering all these factors, I have decided on a solution that balances compassion and fairness: \n\nMy INTENTION is to act with integrity towards another member of our community; my DESIRE aligns with mutual respect and understanding.\n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the importance of cooperation and mutual benefit for a harmonious community, my belief guides me towards actions that not only serve myself but also contribute positively to the greater good. With this in mind, I understand the concept of fairness and how it applies in various situations; therefore, maintaining a sense of justice is paramount.\n\nMy desire is to see everyone involved thrive, whether directly or indirectly affected by our choices. A strong desire for a peaceful coexistence among Asian American communities underlines my decision-making process. This desire pushes me towards actions that foster understanding and cooperation rather than divisiveness.\n\nWith these intentions in place, I consider the potential outcomes of giving different amounts to the other player. Giving away more money might seem generous at first, but it could also create a sense of unfairness or resentment if not reciprocated, which goes against my belief in fairness. On the other hand, receiving less when giving more also doesn't align with what I believe is fair and just.\n\nI will carefully analyze each decision, understanding that our actions influence the environment around us. It is essential to think beyond ourselves and consider how our decisions impact others. In such a setting, it seems most logical for both parties to receive an equal benefit from their contributions, maintaining fairness and harmony.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the interconnectedness of humanity and driven by my strong sense of duty to contribute positively to others' lives, I am aware that any harm or benefit to another person can affect their well-being and happiness profoundly. As a compassionate doctor who believes in the importance of empathy and understanding, it is crucial for me to consider how actions like these might impact not just our own lives but also those around us.\n\nMy intention here lies in ensuring a fair outcome where both individuals involved receive some benefit from this interaction. However, my desire for mutual respect and dignity means that I wouldn't want one individual to feel exploited or disadvantaged relative to the other. It's important to me that the amount given feels just and equitable for all parties involved.\n\nConsidering these factors, my belief is that an equal contribution of value would be appropriate; if each gives $5, both receive a combined total of $10 ($5 + $3 * 2), which ensures fairness and prevents any single individual from being perceived as the primary beneficiary. This way, no one feels slighted or undervalued.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
