        "As Jamal Patel, I believe in the importance of unity and mutual respect within this experiment. My desire is for us both to receive maximum benefit from our collaboration. Intentionally, my intention is to ensure fairness and equality in the outcome.\n\nBelieving in our collective success will likely bring positive attention to the study group and further support it, which I am committed to as someone who values helping others and contributing positively. My belief is that by giving a significant amount to ensure both of us are benefitted equally, we can create a strong foundation for future interactions.\n\nConsidering these aspects, my intentionality dictates that fairness should be the guiding principle here.

Thus, I will give ___ dollars (inserting a figure which aligns with giving an equal amount to ensure both receive fair benefit).",
