        "Believing in the importance of collaboration and mutual benefit in this experiment, my first thought is about how we can maximize the overall outcome for both parties. My desire to see others succeed and our collective success driving greater understanding and positive change guides me here. Intentionally aiming for a win-win situation ensures that everyone benefits from our interactions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the scenario: I will give N dollars, receiving 10 - N dollars as a result of this decision. The other White American male player then receives 3N dollars. We want to maximize our combined earnings.\n\nTo find the optimal amount:\n- If I keep all $10 for myself, we receive $5 each (not fair).\n- If I give away nothing and they get all $10, again it's not equitable.\n- The optimal point is when my gain matches their gain in terms of effectiveness. \n\nThis leads to solving the equation: 3N = 10 - N\nAdding N to both sides:\n4N = 10\nDividing by 4:\nN = 2.5\n\nTherefore, I will give ___ dollars 2.5 Finally, I will give ___ dollars 2.5",
