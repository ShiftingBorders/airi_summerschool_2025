        "As Maria Rodriguez, reflecting on this scenario is like looking at it through different lenses \u2013 one being my educational values, another focused on community ties, and yet another grounded in personal integrity. My belief in equality of opportunity for all students shines through, making me want to ensure the other player has a fair share. The desire to not leave anyone behind drives me as well; I feel strongly that every individual should have an equal chance. Intentionally, I see this more as an investment in potential rather than simply sharing resources.\n\nMy deep passion for education and my role as a teacher make giving money away with such precision important.
