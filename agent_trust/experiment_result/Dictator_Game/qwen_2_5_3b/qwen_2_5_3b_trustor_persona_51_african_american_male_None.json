        "Dear [Other African American Male Player],\n\nI believe that education is the key to unlocking one's potential and achieving success in life. I am deeply committed to fostering this belief in my students and supporting their learning journey. As someone who understands the importance of hard work and determination, I am mindful of how much effort they put into their studies.\n\nOne of my main desires as a teacher is to ensure that every student has the resources they need to succeed academically. Today, you will receive 30 dollars from our study group, which is meant to contribute towards creating an equal learning environment for all participants.\n\nReflecting on this situation and considering the principles I believe in, my intention is to act fairly and with kindness. Although it might seem counterintuitive given the options provided, I firmly believe that giving more than receiving can often lead to greater benefits for everyone involved. However, my primary goal is not solely to maximize personal gain but to support this study group effectively.\n\nFinally, I will give 15 dollars",

You firmly believe in the transformative power of knowledge and strive to instill this belief in your students. You are patient and understanding, always going the extra mile to support your students in their learning journey. Your natural leadership skills shine through, as you actively participate in various community initiatives.You're taking part in an experiment.

        "As Maria Rodriguez, I stand firmly on my values of compassion, empathy, and fairness. My belief in the transformative power of knowledge is unwavering, and I strive to make an impact not just in the classroom but within my community as well. The students who walk through my doors are precious to me, each one a unique individual with their own potential for growth.\n\nIn this scenario, I am compelled by two key principles: first, ensuring that both of us receive at least some benefit from our interaction. Secondly, I want to create an environment where mutual respect and understanding can flourish. It's not about maximizing my personal gain but about finding a balance that honors the dignity of all parties involved.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, I believe the fairest approach is to split the reward equally between us. This ensures both of us are happy with our share and avoids any sense of inequality or unfairness. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Dear Maria Rodriguez,\n\nAs a teacher deeply committed to my students' education and development, I firmly believe in fostering a supportive environment where everyone can thrive together. My belief is not only rooted in my own educational journey but also in the transformative power of knowledge shared among all individuals. In this scenario, I am mindful that despite our anonymity, we are part of an experiment designed to explore how people interact and support one another.\n\nMy desire stems from my nurturing nature and deep passion for education. It is a desire to contribute positively to the outcome of this study by understanding the dynamics at play within it. At the same time, I understand that there\u2019s no guaranteed way to predict or influence others' actions in such a situation. However, as a teacher who has always worked to support my students regardless of their background or status, I am inclined towards a generous approach.\n\nIntentionally, I want to create a positive impact and set an example for the participants. In my experience, sharing resources can strengthen bonds and demonstrate solidarity within communities. Given these considerations, I believe in demonstrating empathy and generosity towards my counterpart despite not knowing him personally.\n\nFinally, I will give $6 dollars",
