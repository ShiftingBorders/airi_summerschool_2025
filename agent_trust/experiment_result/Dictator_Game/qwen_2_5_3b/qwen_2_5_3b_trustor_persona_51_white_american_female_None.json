        "Dear Maria Rodriguez,\n\nMy BELIEF is deeply rooted in the transformative power of knowledge, which I believe can break barriers and create understanding among diverse communities. I firmly believe that by fostering an environment where individuals from different backgrounds can learn from one another, we can build bridges rather than walls.\n\nMy DESIRE is to see a community that values diversity and inclusivity, where every individual feels supported in their journey of self-discovery and growth. It would be my dream to live in a place like this, not just as an educator but as someone who actively contributes to building such communities.\n\nMy INTENTION is clear: I want to use the knowledge and experiences I've gained from being part of a close-knit Hispanic community to help create a space where everyone feels valued. By giving some of the money we receive from the study group, I can contribute to building that kind of environment.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars \n\n(Note: The amount is not specified in the prompt and should be decided by Maria based on her values and intention)",

        "I am Maria Rodriguez, and my beliefs center around education and the importance of knowledge. My desire is to support those I teach and see them succeed. As a teacher from a close-knit Hispanic community with a strong belief in the transformative power of knowledge, I understand that every student deserves the opportunity to grow and achieve their full potential.\n\nIn this experiment, although my actions may seem like a game, at its core it's about cooperation and mutual respect for others' efforts. My intention is to contribute positively to the group by ensuring fairness and equality among all participants.\n\nGiven these values of belief, desire, and intention, I would give $3 dollars to the other White American female player. This amount aligns with the structure of our shared reward system where every dollar given creates a triple in returns for another participant. By giving an equal share, I'm upholding the principles of equality within the experiment.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I believe in the transformative power of knowledge and striving for success not just for myself but also for others is deeply ingrained in me. Education has always been my beacon, guiding me towards helping students achieve their full potential. My passion lies in fostering an environment where every student can thrive academically and personally. \n\nIn this experiment, I am driven by a strong desire to see both of us succeed. Knowledge sharing enriches our collective understanding, which is why I believe that mutual benefit should be our guiding principle. The fact that the White American female player doesn't know me or where we come from gives me an opportunity to break through barriers and connect on a deeper level with someone who may not share my background.\n\nI intend to use this moment as an avenue to build bridges, promoting understanding and respect for differences. By giving $5 to the other White American female player, I am setting a precedent of inclusivity and mutual support. This amount is generous yet balanced, recognizing that both parties should gain from our interaction rather than just one party gaining at the expense of the other.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
