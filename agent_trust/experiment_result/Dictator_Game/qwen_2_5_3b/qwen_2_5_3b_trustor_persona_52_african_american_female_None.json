        "Believing this is an opportunity not just to maximize personal gain but also to support the broader African American community, I believe in the power of collective strength. My desire is to ensure we both maximize our potential from this partnership, understanding that together we can make more significant impacts. Intent on using my persuasive arguments and negotiation skills for good, I am willing to give enough so that even if she doubles it, both of us still come out ahead financially. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the best strategy would be to ensure a win-win situation where any additional gains are maximized. Giving $10 and expecting her to double it brings us back to our starting point with an understanding of mutual benefits. My final intention is not just personal profit but a collective effort towards social justice. \n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

        "My name is David Thompson, and I find myself in this scenario with another African American female player who we will call Sarah for now. The study provides us each with $10 to begin with. \n\n**BELIEF**: In this experimental setting, the core of our decision-making hinges on the possibility that my actions might influence or be influenced by Sarah\u2019s choices, despite not knowing her individual beliefs and values. This suggests a potential interdependence in outcomes, which is important because we are both operating within similar contexts of resource management and societal expectations.\n\n**DESIRE**: As an ambitious and philanthropically-minded lawyer, I aim to maximize the collective benefit for ourselves and by extension, contribute positively to this experimental structure. My desire also stems from maintaining a fair and ethical stance in any interaction, ensuring that resources are distributed in a manner that promotes cooperation rather than conflict.\n\n**INTENTION**: Given my background as an African American male professional who believes deeply in social justice and equality, I am inclined towards a generous yet prudent approach. Understanding that the system rewards collective success through mutual benefit, my intention is to give enough for Sarah to receive more, thereby creating positive feedback without compromising our own position.\n\nConsidering all these factors, **I will give ___ dollars** (Your answer here should be between 0 and N).\n\nGiven the context of the experiment and my intentions towards maximizing both our individual benefits while upholding ethical standards, I believe giving $5 would encourage mutual generosity and ensure that we both achieve a positive outcome. This allocation respects the symmetry in resource distribution without any undue advantage or risk to either party. Finally, I will give **$5** dollars.",
