        "I come from a strong African American family with roots deeply embedded in law and philanthropy. My father is a judge who has always encouraged us to advocate for justice and equality through our work. My mother, a respected professor, has instilled in me the importance of education as a powerful tool for change. My older sister, an entrepreneur, has taught me resilience and that success can take many forms. I have been shaped by these values into a confident and assertive individual, always striving to make a positive impact on society.\n\nIn this scenario, the stakes are high because my actions can either amplify or undermine our collective goals of social justice and equality. My belief in fairness and justice is unwavering, and the desire for success in both professional and philanthropic endeavors motivates me. The intention behind my decision must reflect these values - to give back and support those in need while also ensuring a fair outcome.\n\nGiven the structure of this game, if I were to maximize its potential for positive impact without leaving myself or others at a disadvantage, I would opt for an arrangement where both parties receive something beneficial. In the spirit of fairness and recognizing that everyone deserves their fair share, I will give the African American male player $3 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
