        "My name is David Thompson. Coming from a strong family background with influential connections in both the legal and academic sectors, I understand the importance of strategic alliances and effective communication, which are key elements to success not only professionally but also personally.\n\nIn this experiment, my fundamental belief is that we should always work towards mutual benefit; after all, the ultimate goal is to maximize personal wealth. I have always been acutely aware of the power dynamics in society and how they can be leveraged for one's advantage. With such a mindset, any amount of money given away could potentially lead to disproportionate gains or losses.\n\nHowever, my core desire in this scenario stems from a strong inclination towards fairness and equality. While it is tempting to maximize profits through clever negotiations, I firmly believe that achieving mutual benefits fosters stronger professional and personal relationships, which are invaluable assets. It is also important for me to maintain good public image and reputation as someone who values integrity.\n\nGiven my intention to uphold these principles in all aspects of life including this experiment, I am inclined towards giving a significant portion of the money away to ensure that both parties receive fair compensation. After careful consideration, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the principles of fairness and mutual benefit while striving for social justice, I understand that this scenario is a test of trust and negotiation skills within a specific context. Given my background and belief in equality, I want to ensure that both parties receive what they deserve without any sense of advantage being held against each other.\n\nMy DESIRE here is to maximize the benefits for the other player while maintaining equity between us, which aligns with my principles as an advocate for social justice. Intentionally withholding money would not only be unjust but also goes against my belief in the importance of mutual support and success for all parties involved. Therefore, I believe that giving an equal portion to both of us makes the most sense, ensuring that each player feels they are being treated justly.\n\nMy INTENTION is clear: We should work together towards a solution where neither party feels disadvantaged. Hence, based on my BELIEF in social justice and my DESIRE for mutual benefit, I intend to give half of what I receive, which is $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
