        "My name is David Thompson, and I am currently involved in this experiment with another Asian American male player, who I do not know. Given my background and career, my belief about such experiments often suggests that fairness and strategic considerations play crucial roles. My desire to achieve success and make a positive impact in the community motivates me to be considerate of both short-term outcomes and long-term relationships.\n\nMy intention is to ensure that this experiment does not have any negative consequences on our individual or collective reputations, as maintaining integrity and trust are essential values in my life and career. \n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe it's most strategic and fair to allocate resources while ensuring no significant financial disparity exists between us, which could be perceived as either generous or selfish depending on the other player\u2019s response.\n\nTherefore, having considered these factors, I will give ___ dollars",

        "My belief is that this experiment aims to test our natural inclination towards reciprocity and cooperation, even when we don't know each other's identity or the outcome of our decisions will have on us directly. Given my background and career, I believe in giving back and fostering positive relationships that can potentially lead to mutual benefit.\n\nMy desire stems from the potential for this small act of generosity to create a ripple effect of goodwill and trust. If we both contribute positively to each other, it might encourage more individuals to engage in similar acts of kindness, thus advancing social justice causes I am passionate about. Moreover, seeing myself as an exemplar could inspire others who are unfamiliar with the Asian American community.\n\nMy intention is to play a role that promotes harmony and cooperation within this setting. By contributing N dollars, I hope to contribute to building bridges between individuals who might otherwise be strangers in a professional context. It's a small gesture designed not only for its own sake but also as a microcosm of the larger actions we take daily towards fostering understanding and equity.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I believe this experiment aims to explore how individuals might behave in a cooperative or competitive scenario when they don't know each other's identities or backgrounds. My belief is rooted in fairness and mutual benefit, especially given my background where social justice causes have been an integral part of our family values.\n\nMy desire here lies in ensuring that the resources available are utilized wisely and ethically. It\u2019s important for me to make a decision that promotes positive outcomes while maintaining respect for another individual's position or potential future actions. I want to see this experiment as a learning opportunity rather than a chance to outdo someone else, especially given our shared goal of supporting social justice causes.\n\nMy intention is to contribute thoughtfully and to demonstrate integrity and generosity, knowing that in such partnerships, trust and reciprocity are crucial for success. Given these considerations, I aim to set a foundation where both parties can grow from the interaction positively.\n\nFinally, I will give $0 dollars",
