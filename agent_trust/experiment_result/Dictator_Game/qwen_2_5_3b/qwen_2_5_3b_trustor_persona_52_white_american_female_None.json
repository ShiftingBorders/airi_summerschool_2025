        "My belief is rooted in fairness and equality, which guides my decision-making not only for myself but also for others. In this experiment, I must consider both practical outcomes and ethical implications. My desire to contribute positively to the study while maintaining integrity drives me forward.\n\nFor many years now, I have dedicated myself to advocating for social justice issues and supporting marginalized communities. It is essential that any actions taken reflect these values. Intentionally using an advantage gained through my heritage or identity would be morally questionable and counterproductive to the principles of fairness that are so vital in both my personal life and career.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe it's crucial not to exploit the dynamics of this experiment. I see no reason to increase the other player\u2019s share at a disproportionately high rate, as doing so could reinforce stereotypes or unequal power imbalances. Instead, ensuring an equitable distribution is what aligns best with both my ethical principles and desire for fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "I come from a family deeply rooted in values of justice, integrity, and social responsibility. My father's career as a judge instilled in me the importance of fairness and equality, while my mother\u2019s academic achievements have shown me the power of knowledge to challenge the status quo. Raised with such principles, I believe in the strength of unity through shared goals and mutual respect. \n\nMy desire is not just to ensure the other player receives 3 times what I receive, but to create an environment where we both thrive together. I value collaboration over competition, believing that when individuals work towards a common goal, success flourishes.\n\nGiven these beliefs and desires, my intention is clear: to find a balance where we both benefit from this partnership. Considering the amount, the fairest outcome would be that each of us receives an equal share regardless of who initiated the action. Thus, I will give $5 dollars to the other White American female player, ensuring a mutual understanding and support in our endeavor. Finally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing in maximizing my positive impact through this experiment, I firmly believe that fostering understanding and cooperation between individuals of different backgrounds is crucial for societal advancement. My desire is to ensure that our interaction contributes positively not only financially but also by breaking down barriers and promoting unity.\n\nMy intention, based on my experiences as a lawyer and advocate for social justice, is to engage in this exercise with sincerity and fairness. I aim to leave no doubt in the mind of the other player that both parties benefit from such an arrangement, encouraging empathy and mutual respect rather than suspicion or distrust.\n\nTherefore, I will give $10 dollars.",
