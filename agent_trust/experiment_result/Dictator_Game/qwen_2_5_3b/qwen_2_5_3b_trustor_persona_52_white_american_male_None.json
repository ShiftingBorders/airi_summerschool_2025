        "As David Thompson, I am driven by my deep belief in social justice and equality, principles which guide my personal life as well as professional career. My family's background has instilled in me a strong sense of duty to contribute positively to society, and I'm committed to using my skills for such purposes.\n\nWith this conviction, it becomes clear that the ethical decision here should be one that maximizes overall benefits without perpetuating systemic injustices or inequalities. However, since giving away more money could have unintended negative consequences in future interactions with this individual (who remains unknown), a measured approach seems most appropriate and principled.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe that by not giving any money to the other player, I am still being considerate and ethical. This decision allows us both an equal starting point without any imbalance introduced from my side. \n\nTherefore, I will give ___ dollars  \n(0)",

        "My belief is that we are part of something bigger than ourselves - a community that thrives when each member contributes positively to the whole. My desire is not just to achieve success for myself, but also to see this experiment contribute meaningfully towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society. My intention is clear: I aim to use this opportunity as a platform to advocate for social justice and equality.\n\nIn this context, I want my actions to inspire others and encourage empathy rather than dividing us into \"winners\" and \"losers.\" By choosing not to maximize personal profit but instead focusing on mutual gain, we set an example of collaboration over competition. \n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
