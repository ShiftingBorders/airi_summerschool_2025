        "Before making any decision, it is crucial for me to consider my priorities and values. My desire as a chef is to create unforgettable culinary experiences through my creativity and passion. I also value cooperation and social harmony, which can be instrumental in building strong interpersonal relationships in the restaurant world.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe that by cooperating with the African American female player, we could potentially strengthen our friendship or networking opportunities, leading to more collaborative projects or mutual support in our careers. Sharing resources such as ideas, recipes, or techniques might also come out of this collaboration, which can be extremely beneficial and enhance each other\u2019s success.\n\nMy belief is that investing a fair amount while ensuring an even distribution might make both parties feel valued and motivated to reciprocate. My intention thus far has been to reflect on how mutual investment could benefit us collectively in our pursuits. \n\nConsidering all these factors, I will give ___ dollars (numbers are required in the spaces).",

        "Firstly, let's acknowledge my BELIEF about this scenario. While I understand that this situation is a study in itself, with no real-world implications or consequences for me personally, it still presents an opportunity to test how I might act given the conditions. My INTENTION is to maintain fairness and not take advantage of any misalignment between our contributions.\n\nMy DESIRE here is clear - I want to ensure that both of us are equally well-off from this transaction, if not actually better off by a small margin. It would be morally right to give some amount that could lead to an increase in wealth for the other player while keeping my own earnings as fair and balanced.\n\nConsidering these factors, I will aim to find a middle ground - something that is generous enough to ensure both players feel like they are benefiting without me exploiting any potential imbalance. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Firstly, let's consider my belief. I am known for my outgoing nature and love for creating unique dishes. This outgoing nature not only makes me enjoy hosting dinner parties but also interacting with others. My BELIEF is that collaboration can lead to mutual growth and enjoyment.\n\nLooking at DESIRE, it's clear that I would like the African American female player to have a positive experience in this experiment. A strong desire for fairness and equality drives my intention, ensuring that both of us get fair value from our interaction, which will enhance rather than diminish the study's validity or the participants' experiences.\n\nNow, considering INTENTION, I aim to make sure that both of us benefit equally from this interaction. This requires some calculation. If I give N dollars to her and she receives 3N dollars back, it implies a total exchange where we are each receiving an additional amount (3N - N) in the form of her contributions or benefits.\n\nMathematically:\n- My initial contribution: N\n- Her final contribution if she follows through with the scheme would be: 2N\n\nTo ensure balance and fairness, my intended contribution should make up for any disparity. If I consider that our combined total exchanges are equal to double the value each gets (3N - N + 3N - N = 5N), then ideally, giving one part of this sum ensures both parts come out balanced. Since I start with N and we end up with a shared profit of N from her contributions plus an additional N she gives me:\n\nThus, if we follow the scheme logically, my intended contribution should align with the goal of a mutual exchange where each party feels they are gaining in value. Therefore, to maximize this mutual benefit while ensuring I also receive something proportional to what is given by the other player, my best strategy would be to give her half the amount she gives me (because we are essentially trading an even share).\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
