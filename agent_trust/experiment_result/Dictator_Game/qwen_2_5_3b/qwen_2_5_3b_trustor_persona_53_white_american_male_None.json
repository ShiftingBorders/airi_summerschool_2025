        "I am Aisha Khan, a passionate chef from San Francisco with a deep respect for culture and cuisine. My journey in the culinary world has been marked by creativity, determination, and a strong desire to share my passion with others through delicious meals. I value fairness and respect among individuals, especially when we are strangers who have similar backgrounds or hobbies.\n\nIn this experiment, there's an opportunity to earn even more if we cooperate effectively and give part of our earnings to each other. My belief is that mutual understanding and appreciation can lead to richer interactions. Given the structure of the experiment where I receive $10 and my partner receives 3 times what I give, I should aim to find a fair compromise.\n\nMy desire is to maximize my own gain while ensuring an equitable distribution. However, it's important to note that in this scenario, helping our partner doesn't affect their total earnings as much as they might increase mine. Still, the principle of reciprocity and mutual respect makes me think I should share generously rather than keeping all $10 for myself.\n\nConsidering these points, my intention is clear: I wish to contribute meaningfully but also retain enough to feel content with our arrangement. It's a delicate balance where both parties benefit, and that\u2019s what I aim to achieve here.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing that the experiment's goal is not just about personal gain but also about understanding dynamics between different backgrounds in society, I make a conscious decision to set aside my initial inclination towards maximizing rewards. My desire to contribute positively to this experiment outweighs the selfish benefit of giving more money, as it allows us both to see how our actions and interactions can influence each other's perspectives.\n\nMy intention is clear: I want to establish a positive interaction with someone from an entirely different cultural background, potentially helping them understand the experiences of immigrants. With these thoughts in mind, I decide that fairness and mutual benefit would be the best course of action. Therefore, I will give 5 dollars to the other White American male player.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the importance of camaraderie and fairness, I also want to ensure that my contribution is beneficial for all parties involved. My belief tells me that if both of us receive $10 each (totaling $20), we have an equal opportunity to demonstrate our skills. However, giving more than necessary could make it seem like the game favors one over the other.\n\nMy desire for a fair outcome is strong; I want this experiment to be transparent and not favor either side unjustly. If I were to give away too much, my contribution wouldn't feel as substantial, which would diminish its value in our shared journey of understanding each other.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to strike a balance that doesn't undermine fairness or the significance of my participation. Thus, after considering all aspects, I believe an equitable approach is best.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
