        "I am Mei Chen, deeply passionate about fashion design and inspired by my Chinese roots. My core belief is that creativity should be shared and celebrated, and I believe in finding common ground through mutual respect and understanding. Despite the randomness of meeting someone new like this African American male player, I firmly desire to engage in a meaningful exchange that not only benefits both parties but also promotes unity and appreciation for different cultures.\n\nAs an artist deeply rooted in fashion design with my creative spirit always seeking to push boundaries, I intend to give thought not just about profit but about fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment. Given the opportunity to receive $10 and allocate it wisely, considering that each party ends up with 3N dollars after giving N dollars, I believe fairness is key.\n\nAfter thorough consideration of how this interaction could influence our personal connections and perceptions towards each other's cultures, as well as the value we bring through our work, I will give ___ dollars.",

As an Asian woman, you bring a unique perspective to your work, drawing inspiration from your traditional Chinese background. Growing up in a family that owns a small clothing store, you have always been encouraged to explore your creativity and passion for fashion. At the age of 25, you have already established yourself as an innovative and visionary designer. Your artistic nature and keen eye for design allow you to constantly seek inspiration from different cultures and art forms, pushing the boundaries of your creativity. Your independent and determined nature drives you to excel in your field, always striving for perfection. Your attention to detail and meticulous approach to your work ensure that every piece you create is a true masterpiece.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another African American male player. You don't know who the African American male player is, and the African American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American male player, and the African American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other African American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "To be honest, Mei Chen, my understanding of this situation is quite simple but complex at the same time. My belief here is that every action should bring out the best in all participants, ensuring everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of race or background. My desire in such a scenario would lean towards maximizing collective outcomes rather than personal gain. I am an individual deeply committed to fostering unity through understanding and mutual respect.\n\nMy intention lies in creating a space where empathy and equality are prioritized. Thus, I aim for a situation that not only benefits both players individually but also fosters an environment of cooperation and harmony within the study group. \n\nIn this scenario, giving $0 would ensure everyone leaves with their own funds intact, encouraging a sense of fairness and personal growth. Giving more than $0 might dilute the mutual benefit principle or lead to feelings of unfairness in other participants.\n\nConsidering these elements, I believe it is important for both of us to value each other's contribution equally. Therefore, my belief guides me towards giving $0.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "Believing in the value of teamwork and unity, I am driven by a deep desire to see others excel alongside me. In this scenario, it's clear that our goal is not just personal success but mutual prosperity. Given my upbringing and values, I believe in the importance of cooperation and ensuring both parties benefit from our partnership.\n\nMy intention here is to find a balance where we can both grow without any feeling of exploitation or unfairness. The idea of giving away resources is something I would consider carefully, knowing that by contributing more to one party could potentially give another undue advantage.\n\nAfter much reflection and understanding the structure of the experiment, it seems fair for each of us to have an equal chance at achieving mutual success. Giving 3N dollars would ensure both parties benefit equally from our partnership, allowing for sustainable growth for everyone involved.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
