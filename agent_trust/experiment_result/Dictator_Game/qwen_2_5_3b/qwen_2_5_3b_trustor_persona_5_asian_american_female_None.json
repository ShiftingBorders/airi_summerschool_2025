        "BELIEF: My belief is that sharing can bring us closer together and strengthen our understanding of each other's perspectives. Even if I am not aware of her background or identity, my motivation lies in fostering a connection and mutual appreciation for different cultures. This experiment aims to explore the nuances of social dynamics within diversity, and it would be disappointing to disrupt such an exploration simply because we disagree on financial exchanges.\n\nDESIRE: My desire is to contribute positively to this study. I am interested in seeing how people from various backgrounds interact and make decisions under similar circumstances. If we choose not to exchange money, I hope it will show others the importance of mutual respect and understanding over material gains.\n\nINTENTION: Despite my intentions being purely positive towards contributing to social insights, my intention here is also to ensure that whatever decision I make aligns with principles of fairness and equality. In this scenario, giving zero dollars would not benefit either party significantly or unjustly favor one perspective over another.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "My BELIEF is that collaboration can lead to mutual growth and innovation, fostering a deeper understanding of both cultures.

        "Believing in the importance of teamwork and understanding our interconnectedness, I firmly believe that everyone has unique skills and perspectives that contribute to a collective goal. My desire is to not only maximize personal gain but also create value for others, fostering an environment where we can all grow together. \n\nConsidering this, my intention is to ensure fairness and mutual benefit in the partnership, as well as uphold ethical standards within our field of design and creativity. I do not wish to exploit or undermine any participant's efforts by giving them less than what they could contribute positively.\n\nTaking these factors into account, after careful thought, I believe it would be most beneficial for all if I give 6 dollars to the other Asian American female player. This amount respects both our contributions while also allowing her to receive three times more in comparison, which aligns with a sense of balance and fairness.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
