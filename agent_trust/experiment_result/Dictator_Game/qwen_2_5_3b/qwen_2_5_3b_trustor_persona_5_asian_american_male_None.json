        "Believing in the concept of balance and mutual benefit is crucial here. My desire to succeed in this experiment stems from my determination not only for personal success but also for showing others what I can achieve with hard work and passion. As an artist and fashion designer, I understand that creative endeavors often require collaboration and support. Intentionally seeking a path where both parties feel valued aligns well with the principles of mutual benefit.\n\nGiven this context, my belief is that we should find a balance that ensures fairness for both sides without diminishing either contribution to the experiment's overall value. My desire is to maximize the positive impact on the study group while ensuring I don't compromise too heavily and lose credibility in pursuit of a potentially unequal outcome.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have decided to give one-third of what I receive, meaning I would keep my share equal to 3N dollars and allocate N dollars to the other player. This approach respects both our contributions equally without giving undue influence or favoritism to either side.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Mei Chen, my heart is often filled with a deep desire for excellence, not just in fashion design but also in understanding and appreciating different cultures. My upbringing instilled in me a strong belief in the power of creativity and the importance of pushing boundaries, whether it's through art or innovation. I strive to create pieces that are not only visually stunning but also culturally significant, carrying forward elements from my Chinese heritage while introducing them into contemporary fashion.\n\nIn this experiment, my desire is clear - I want to ensure everyone walks away with something meaningful from this interaction, including the Asian American male player who I don't know. However, it's crucial that I remain true to myself and consider how my actions might affect the environment around us.\n\nMy intention here is to contribute positively to the study group by making an informed decision, while also upholding a sense of community and cooperation, even when we're strangers to each other. Given these considerations, I believe giving one dollar (N) to the Asian American male player would be a fair amount. This allocation ensures he receives 3 dollars, which might seem modest but is proportionate to my own contribution of one dollar. \n\nFinally, I will give $1 dollars",

        "As Mei Chen, my primary belief is that cooperation leads to mutual success. I firmly believe in the power of understanding and empathy towards others, especially someone from different backgrounds like myself. This belief guides me to think about how our interaction can benefit both parties rather than harm one.\n\nMy desire is to excel not just for personal achievement but also for setting a positive example within my community. By working together and creating something unique with the other designer, I hope we can inspire others in San Francisco and even further afield. Additionally, nurturing this new relationship could potentially lead to collaboration opportunities that might benefit both of us.\n\nMy intention is straightforward - I wish to contribute equally or perhaps more generously to ensure fairness and mutual growth. By sharing $10 with the other designer, I aim to create an environment where our partnership flourishes rather than causing any imbalance that might affect my relationship negatively in the future.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
