        "I am Mei Chen, a talented fashion designer based in San Francisco. My upbringing was deeply rooted in the rich culture of China, where my family's small clothing store played a significant role in shaping both my cultural identity and professional aspirations. From an early age, I was encouraged to explore my creative side, which eventually blossomed into my passion for fashion design.\n\nMy DESIRE is strong; it drives me to constantly push the boundaries of creativity and innovation. Every piece that comes out of my studio is not just clothing, but a reflection of my heritage, experiences, and the influence of various art forms I have encountered over the years. My INTENTION is always aligned with the idea of elevating traditional craftsmanship into contemporary fashion statements while maintaining authenticity and cultural integrity.\n\nMy BELIEF as an Asian woman in the Western world is one of resilience and innovation. It is not uncommon to face challenges due to stereotypes or a lack of visibility, but my upbringing has taught me that adversity can be overcome with hard work and perseverance. I firmly believe that through my designs, I can make a statement about inclusivity and respect for cultural diversity.\n\nIn this experiment, the White American female player remains unknown; I don't know who she is, nor does she know me. This creates a unique situation where our actions are not bound by preconceived notions of what we should do in such scenarios. My DESIRE to excel drives me to consider how best I can contribute positively while also being mindful of the fairness and equality inherent in the experiment's design.\n\nGiven my INTENTION, which is always one of creativity and innovation combined with a strong sense of responsibility towards preserving cultural heritage, I believe that sharing the wealth equally would be most appropriate. By giving N dollars to her, she will receive 3N dollars, ensuring that our contributions balance each other out while acknowledging our mutual investment.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Mei Chen, my belief is rooted deeply in traditional Chinese culture and fashion design. I strive to blend modern aesthetics with traditional elements, creating pieces that not only embody cultural heritage but also speak to contemporary sensibilities. My desire is to continue building my reputation as an innovative designer while preserving the essence of my roots.\n\nGiven our situation, it's important for me to consider how my actions might influence both our roles in this study and how we perceive each other's contributions. I believe in fairness and cooperation, knowing that mutual respect will lead us closer to understanding one another. However, I am also driven by my need to maintain independence and ensure I do not feel exploited.\n\nI observe the possibility of a partnership where our combined efforts could yield significant results. At the same time, giving away an equivalent amount might seem unbalanced or too generous. Reflecting on these factors, I decide that it would be most appropriate if both of us contribute equally to maintain balance and respect for each other's contributions.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing deeply in the value of mutual respect and collaboration, I understand that we form a team here for a reason\u2014to innovate and create something meaningful together. My DESIRE is to see this partnership succeed not just for my personal gain but also to contribute positively to the study's outcome. Given our financial structure, it would be fair and conducive if both parties benefited equally.\n\nINTENTIONALLY, I aim to model my behavior on the principles of equity and fairness, ensuring that neither party feels disadvantaged or underrepresented. If we divide the $10 in a 3:1 ratio (my proposal for N=2), this means you would receive 6 dollars and I would keep 4 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars",
