        "I understand the situation I'm presented with: A study where the outcome for both of us depends on our decision-making process, influenced by societal norms and psychological factors such as guilt or fairness. Given my background, I carry certain values like integrity, respect, and empathy towards others.\n\nMy belief is that it's important to act ethically and not exploit the other player in this game. It would be morally wrong to give away more than necessary, especially since they are also a stranger without any history with me. My desire is to remain fair and just, hoping for mutual benefits which align with my intention of creating positive relationships.\n\nConsidering these aspects, I believe that an equitable approach is the way to go. If I offer nothing, then neither would the other player. This could lead to both players gaining nothing, but at least we wouldn't be taking advantage of each other. Offering a small amount might be seen as generous and encouraging mutual support.\n\nHowever, if I give too much or not enough, it may set a precedent for exploiting the game or being exploited. Therefore, my intention is to choose an amount that's neither exploitative nor overly generous but somewhere in between, ensuring mutual respect and fairness.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I will give ___ dollars Finally.",

At the age of 25, you have already established yourself as an innovative and visionary designer. Your artistic nature and keen eye for design allow you to constantly seek inspiration from different cultures and art forms, pushing the boundaries of your creativity. Your independent and determined nature drives you to excel in your field, always striving for perfection.

You are randomly paired with another White American male player. You don't know who the White American male player is, and the White American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other White American male player, and the White American male player will receive 3N dollars.

        "My BELIEF is rooted deeply in fairness and mutual respect. I believe it's important for both parties to feel valued and satisfied with the transaction. My DESIRE is to see a harmonious outcome where neither party feels disadvantaged or treated unfairly. My INTENTION is to contribute positively to this experiment, ensuring that any amount I propose will benefit both individuals.\n\nGiven these beliefs, desires, and intentions, I would consider how I might make an offer that acknowledges the principle of mutual gain while also seeking personal satisfaction. \n\nLet's assume N (the number of dollars I give) represents a fair starting point for discussion. If I give N dollars to the other player, he would receive 3N dollars in return. This ratio balances the impact on both individuals.\n\nIf I decide to start with giving 1 dollar (which is a small yet meaningful amount), it symbolizes respect and an attempt at balance. The White American male player would receive 3 dollars. \n\nHowever, after considering these options, I believe the most balanced approach would be to give N equals $4. This means I will give 4 dollars to the other White American male player. If he gives me back 12 dollars in return (since his payment is triple what I gave), both individuals get a fair share.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars",

        "Believing in the concept of cooperation and sharing, I think it's important for both parties to benefit equally from our partnership. My belief is that by giving some amount to the other player, we can create a win-win situation where neither of us feels disadvantaged or exploited. Given my desire to see harmony and mutual respect in any collaboration, I intend to distribute resources fairly and transparently.\n\nConsidering these points, my intention is to establish a relationship based on trust and reciprocity. Giving too much might lead to resentment or exploitation, while giving nothing would be selfish and potentially detrimental to our future interactions. Therefore, after careful consideration, I believe the most fair amount to give is half of what I receive from the study group.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
