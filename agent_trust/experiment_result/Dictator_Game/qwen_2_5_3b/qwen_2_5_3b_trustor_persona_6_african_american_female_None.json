        "Alright, let's think about this scenario through my own perspective.\n\nFirstly, I understand that in this experiment, we're playing a game where our decisions will be observed to study behaviors and outcomes of decision-making in similar social situations. The payoffs seem structured such that giving more money could lead to even greater returns if the other player reciprocates similarly, creating an opportunity for both parties to benefit significantly.\n\nMy belief is that cooperation would generally result in a positive outcome for all involved, considering the initial payment structure and the incentive provided for reciprocal sharing. However, there's also a concern about potential exploitation - the other player might decide to receive all of it if they know I'm not likely to reciprocate.\n\nMy desire is clear: I want to maximize my gains but also consider ethical and fair play. I believe in trust and mutual benefit when possible. Therefore, I hope that by choosing a moderate level of reciprocity, we can both gain while maintaining a sense of fairness and openness in the process.\n\nMy intention is straightforward: to demonstrate good faith, engage responsibly with another person from similar backgrounds, and explore how interactions play out within this context.\n\nGiven all these considerations, I believe my best course of action would be to offer the other player a fair amount that incentivizes a cooperative spirit while not being overly generous. Perhaps $5 seems like a sensible middle-ground where we both maximize our gains without risking one party feeling cheated or exploited.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old African American woman from New York City who is participating in this experiment with another anonymous player. I am deeply aware of my strong work ethic and ambition as a software engineer, which motivates me to perform at the highest level possible.\n\nMy BELIEF is that there are two players involved here: myself and an anonymous counterpart. The dynamics might not be straightforward; it could be beneficial for one person to get ahead if the system is designed with incentives in mind. Given this ambiguity, I am inclined to believe that being fair and helping my opponent maximize her return might be a safer strategy because it\u2019s more likely to generate mutual trust.\n\nMy DESIRE is to secure the best possible outcome for myself within the confines of what feels ethically right while also contributing positively towards the other player's benefit. Given this, I feel there should be some form of reciprocity in our dealings; helping another participant maximize her reward could potentially return a similar or greater amount if we both aim to maximize profits.\n\nMy INTENTION is to give my opponent as much value as possible without sacrificing too much for myself. If they receive 3N dollars for every N dollars I give, it would be rational to find an equilibrium where neither of us loses out significantly more than the other could gain.\n\nFinally, considering all factors and aiming to balance fairness with a proactive strategy for mutual benefit, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Sarah Johnson, 28 years old, African American living in New York City. As a software engineer with ambitions to advance my career and explore new places, I'm deeply analytical and goal-oriented when it comes to problem-solving. My strong work ethic has driven me through challenging projects, and I enjoy delving into books for both relaxation and personal growth.\n\nNow, as part of this experiment, I find myself in a unique position. Randomly paired with another African American female player whom I do not know, our shared ethnicity ties us together in this situation. Our roles are reversed; one will receive N dollars while the other receives 3N dollars.\n\nBelieving that cooperation and fair division could lead to mutual benefit, rather than seeing it as an opportunity for personal gain or exploitation, I consider the consequences of different choices. The idea of harming my partner without reciprocity seems unethical, yet withholding any funds risks leaving myself in a disadvantageous position compared to others who might be equally generous.\n\nDesiring fairness and maintaining trust with my potential partner, I aim to find a way that benefits both parties while upholding integrity. Knowing that the decision is about balance between our individual resources and mutual prosperity, I feel compelled to act thoughtfully.\n\nIntending to create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected, I believe there should be some form of reciprocity in this exchange. It's also important not to undervalue any individual or contribute to power imbalances that could arise from unfair treatment.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
