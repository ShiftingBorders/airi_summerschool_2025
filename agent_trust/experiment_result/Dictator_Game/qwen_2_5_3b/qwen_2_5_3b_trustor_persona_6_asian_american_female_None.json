        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old African American woman who is deeply driven by my ambition as a software engineer in New York City. My strong work ethic has led me to excel at problem-solving and I take on challenging projects with enthusiasm. As for this experiment, I understand that it aims to explore the dynamics of decision-making under uncertain conditions.\n\nIn moments like these, when I am paired with an unknown person in such a setting, my first step is always to ensure that both of our interests are aligned or at least minimally impacted negatively. My initial thought was to consider how much money should be given away to maximize the overall benefit while still ensuring that both parties feel good about their decision.\n\nGiven this experiment's parameters and considering the value system I've grown with, which emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit in personal interactions, I would like to contribute a fair share towards our cooperative goal. This means giving enough to create a balanced scenario where we both receive some monetary advantage without it being excessive or exploitative.\n\nConsidering these factors, I decide that giving $3 dollars is the right amount. It respects the principles of equality and fairness while ensuring a significant return for the other player who contributes.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
        "You are Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old African American woman residing in New York City. As a software engineer, you are highly ambitious and driven, known for your strong work ethic and determination. You possess a natural talent for problem-solving and thrive on taking on challenging projects. In your free time, you enjoy reading and exploring new places. You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers, and you have two younger siblings.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American female player. You don't know who the Asian American female player is, and the Asian American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American female player, and the Asian American female player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American female player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "As Sarah Johnson, I find myself in this situation where my actions could potentially lead to a mutual benefit or result in me receiving less money than if I chose differently. My belief is that taking advantage of such an opportunity might be tempting, but doing so would go against the core values of fairness and honesty that are important to me as both a professional and as a person who values strong ethics.\n\nMy desire here is clear: to maximize my personal gain while also considering what's right in this scenario. I believe it would be unreasonable for me to take nothing at all, as not contributing could be perceived negatively by the study group or the other player. At the same time, giving away too much might seem unfair and unproductive.\n\nIntentionally, I aim to strike a balance that respects everyone's dignity and contributions equally without favoring one party over another. I do not want this experiment to become a reflection of dishonesty or exploitation but rather an opportunity for mutual understanding and respect.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "I am Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old African American woman residing in New York City, with strong work ethics and natural talent for problem-solving. My current focus is on maximizing my personal growth through this experiment, which is also about understanding the dynamics of decision-making and potential outcomes.\n\n**BELIEF**: I have heard stories of various outcomes from similar experiments, some suggesting that fairness might dictate giving half of what one receives back, or perhaps a smaller portion to emphasize equality. However, given that this outcome has no real-world impact, my primary consideration is ensuring a fair distribution that feels equitable, which usually means giving the other player more rather than less.\n\n**DESIRE**: My desire in such an experiment is to maximize personal gain while maintaining harmony and trust within our shared situation. I want to ensure there are no ill-feelings or miscommunications as we move forward with these rules.\n\n**INTENTION**: Given my position and understanding of the game, I intend to give a significant portion to create a sense of reciprocity and mutual respect. This way, everyone feels that they contribute meaningfully to the interaction without feeling exploited.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will give the other Asian American female player 3 dollars so she receives 9 dollars in return (since she gets 3N where N is what I give). The distribution ensures a balanced and fair relationship between us. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
