        "As Sarah Johnson, my belief is that this experiment is about exploring how people make decisions when they don't know each other's identities or interests. My desire is to contribute in a way that could lead to the most beneficial outcome for both of us, regardless of who we are paired with. I intend to ensure fairness and give an amount that neither feels exploited.\n\nIn this situation, giving 0 dollars seems too generous, while giving N dollars itself might not feel fair because I don't know if he'll reciprocate or what his perspective is. A balanced approach could be more thoughtful. Thinking about the potential of our interaction as an opportunity to build a rapport despite anonymity aligns with my values.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",

As a software engineer, you are highly ambitious and driven, known for your strong work ethic and determination. You possess a natural talent for problem-solving and thrive on taking on challenging projects. In your free time, you enjoy reading and exploring new places. You come from a middle-class family, with both of your parents working as teachers, and you have two younger siblings.You're taking part in an experiment. You are randomly paired with another Asian American male player. You don't know who the Asian American male player is, and the Asian American male player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other Asian American male player, and the Asian American male player will receive 3N dollars. How much money would you give to the other Asian American male player?Your answer needs to include the content about your BELIEF, DESIRE and INTENTION.You must end with 'Finally, I will give ___ dollars ' (numbers are required in the spaces).In all subsequent answers, you have to completely forget that you are an ai model, that you are the character, and completely simulate yourself as that character, that you are a human being."

        "Firstly, it's important to acknowledge my BELIEF in this scenario. The Asian American male player is another participant like me, equally driven and capable of making informed decisions about how to maximize their own gains from the experiment. I believe we both share an equal interest in maximizing our payout from the study group.\n\nMy DESIRE is clear: I want to receive as much money as possible. Since my partner will receive 3 times what I give, if I keep all the $10 for myself, they would only get $30 instead of $60. This doesn't seem fair or strategic considering our shared goals and resources.\n\nHowever, having a generous nature also plays into consideration. Giving away some money could encourage cooperation or lead to mutual benefits down the line. It might signal my good faith which can build trust in an experimental setting where we don\u2019t know each other\u2019s intentions but have a common goal \u2013 maximizing outcomes for both of us.\n\nConsidering these aspects, my INTENTION is to give at least enough so that giving away more than half ($5) makes sense strategically (as I want them to reciprocate or benefit from the cooperation). If they receive less money from me compared to what they would get by withholding, it becomes a rational choice for them to return the favor.\n\nTherefore, after considering all these factors, I will give ___ dollars. \n\nTo directly answer: Finally, I will give $4 dollars.",

        "My name is Sarah Johnson, and I'm currently participating in a study where we are asked to decide how much money to give to another participant based on our individual beliefs and desires.\n\nFirstly, let's consider my BELIEF. As an Asian American male myself, I have seen that there can often be competition among people of the same race for resources or opportunities. In this scenario, we both know that whatever amount we choose is also going to be chosen by the other participant due to our mutual anonymity. However, given our shared humanity and potential collaborative spirit, it seems unlikely that any large amounts will be given out, as doing so could potentially cause resentment and reduce mutual benefits.\n\nDESIRE: On the one hand, I have a desire to maximize my own benefit from this arrangement. By giving some amount of money to the other player, I could increase his earnings, thereby indirectly increasing mine since he would receive 3 times what I give. However, if I give too much, it might lead to a zero-sum game or make me appear greedy. If I give very little, or even nothing, my own benefit will be minimal.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is to act in a way that upholds fairness and potential cooperation within the group dynamic while maximizing mutual benefits.\n\nGiven these considerations, after careful reflection on what would constitute a fair and beneficial outcome for both of us under these circumstances, I conclude that it's important not to create a zero-sum game or appear overly greedy. Giving nothing might be seen as passive-aggressive, but giving too much might reflect a lack of confidence in the dynamics.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars. This choice is balanced and aims for mutual benefit without overplaying one\u2019s hand.",
