        "My BELIEF here is that we both want to maximize our individual earnings from this scenario. I believe there's no inherent unfairness or inequality in the setup; it\u2019s simply a numerical game of maximizing profit based on how much one decides to offer and receive.\n\nMy DESIRE stems from my strong desire for rational self-interest and the competitive spirit I possess. It would be unwise not to maximize our earnings given this opportunity, as we are both intelligent individuals who have calculated that offering more can lead to a higher payout.\n\nMy INTENTION is to ensure that our collective earnings remain maximized even if it means taking some advantage of the situation. My ultimate intention is to leave with enough profit after making a decision on how much to give away, ensuring my personal gain is not at the expense of an unfair disparity in gains.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would start by thinking critically about what amount offers me an optimal return without setting a red line for my friend's reward that feels exploitative. If I offer too little, it might seem like I am leaving some value on the table, and if I offer too much, it could feel like I am being generous in a potentially manipulative way.\n\nUltimately, I believe a fair ratio of 1:3 (my contribution to her earnings) strikes a reasonable balance. So, considering this logic, I will give ___ dollars Finally, I will give $2 dollars",

        "I come from a middle-class family where both my parents work as educators, and I am known for my strong work ethic and determination as a software engineer in New York City. My natural talent for problem-solving allows me to thrive on taking on challenging projects. In my free time, I enjoy reading and exploring new places.\n\nIn this experiment, I am paired with another White American female player who I do not know. The rules are that we can give N dollars to the other player, and she will receive 3N dollars in return. \n\nMy BELIEF is that if both of us cooperate by giving away a certain amount, it could be beneficial for both of our financial outcomes. However, there's also the fear that one of us might choose not to cooperate and benefit at the expense of the other. This fear could lead to a game where we each think about what would happen if I gave X dollars instead of Y, which could then lead to an impasse.\n\nMy DESIRE is clear \u2013 maximizing my own financial benefit while considering fairness and cooperation.\n\nMy INTENTION is based on these beliefs and desires. Since the White American female player does not know me or who I am, I might be inclined to think about her likely decisions. Knowing that we have $10 in total, a balanced approach would be for me to give away as much as possible without sacrificing my own financial benefit.\n\nAfter careful consideration, given that I want to maximize both our overall benefits and not risk falling into an impasse by making the other player feel exploited or unappreciated, I will give ___ dollars.",

        "I come from a family where both my parents work hard to provide for us, and I've witnessed firsthand how dedication and sacrifice can lead to success. Growing up, we always made sure our younger siblings and I stayed on the right path academically, understanding that education is the cornerstone of opportunity. My parents' commitment to their careers has inspired me to excel in my own, driven by a strong belief in self-improvement and hard work.\n\nIn this scenario, I am aware of the potential for us to leverage each other's resources to maximize our gains from this experiment. However, it is essential that we treat one another with integrity and respect. Giving away too much could be seen as exploitative or even a form of exploitation. Therefore, my desire here would be to balance the outcome such that both of us come out ahead in a fair manner.\n\nIn keeping with my character's values, I believe that any amount given should not compromise our future successes or cause harm to either party. Considering these factors, I will give ___ dollars \n\nI must now put my beliefs into action and ensure a win-win situation for myself and the other player. My intention is clear: to find a middle ground that benefits both parties equally while maintaining the integrity of the experiment's principles.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
