        "Believing in equality and fairness is deeply ingrained in me. As someone who values these principles highly, I find it difficult to participate in any scheme that could be seen as exploiting or dividing resources unfairly. However, understanding the context of this hypothetical experiment, I must weigh my options carefully.\n\nMy belief dictates that everyone deserves a fair chance, regardless of their background. It would not be right for me to contribute to any scenario that feels exploitative or discriminatory. Therefore, while it might be tempting to give away some of what I have in order to ensure both parties benefit, I find such actions counterintuitive given my core values.\n\nMy desire is to uphold these principles and to avoid perpetuating any form of discrimination. This experiment aims at exploring potential biases, but my intention remains steadfast: to participate without giving into the temptation of unequal distribution. Instead of focusing on what could be exchanged between us, I would prefer that we both gain something in this unique setup.\n\nIn this context, it becomes evident that I want to keep all $10 for myself. However, since the experiment stipulates a mutual exchange, and believing in reciprocity is fundamental to my values, ideally, neither of us should be left with any resources.\n\nFinally, I will give 0 dollars",

        "I come from a background where family is very important, especially when it comes to helping each other out in times of need. My parents always emphasized the value of hard work and giving back. They instilled in me the importance of standing up for what's right, no matter who might be different.\n\nMy desire in this scenario stems from my belief that fairness and integrity are paramount. The situation allows for reciprocity, where I can support someone just as I would hope to be supported by a teammate or colleague. However, I also have the desire to ensure we both get something positive out of this arrangement - if possible.\n\nIntentionally, I want us to both feel like we got a fair deal. If it were up to me, I would aim for an equitable distribution where neither party feels disadvantaged. Given that my payout will be 3N dollars while the other player gets N dollars, I could think about something in between - but not too close either way.\n\nConsidering all these elements together, I believe that giving $20 (which means receiving $60) would be a fair and mutual arrangement. It balances our payouts equally and maintains a sense of reciprocity without one person feeling entirely overpowered by the other.\n\nFinally, I will give $20 .",

        "My name is Sarah Johnson, and I am currently living in New York City as a software engineer with a strong passion for problem-solving and challenging projects. Growing up in a middle-class family where both parents were teachers instilled in me the value of hard work and determination. Despite my professional ambitions, I also find joy in exploring new places and reading.\n\nFor this experiment, it's clear that giving some amount to the White American male player could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome or simply maximize one\u2019s share if he doesn't reciprocate. However, considering our roles as equals in the study group and given my desire for mutual respect, I believe in fairness and equality.\n\nI have two main beliefs here: first, I value cooperation and fair play; second, I don\u2019t want to disadvantage anyone or be perceived as biased based on race or any other factor. My desire is to maximize the benefit of all involved while adhering to these principles. Intentionally, I will aim to give a rational amount that balances potential returns with ethical considerations.\n\nAfter weighing these factors, I decide that giving $3 dollars to the White American male player would be fair and beneficial for both parties. This amount allows him to get more money ($9) than me while still being generous enough to show respect for his role in the experiment. \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars \n(Here, you need to provide a number between 0 and 10)",
