        "My name is Javier Rodriguez, and my BELIEF about this experiment stems from the idea of sharing and community. Growing up in a family where we were always generous to one another and supported each other during tough times has ingrained in me a strong sense of fellowship and mutual benefit. I believe that by giving back a portion of what I receive, we can strengthen our connection and foster a supportive environment.\n\nDESIRE is also crucial here. It comes from my natural desire to build relationships with new people and feel connected to others, even if just for a short period. Knowing someone who shares similar values, like valuing generosity and community spirit, could create a positive experience that goes beyond the experiment itself.\n\nINTENTION is about acting in a way that upholds these values. I aim to give something back that feels fair and meaningful, which would be giving one-third of what I receive (which amounts to $3).\n\nFinally, I will give $3",

From a young age, you learned to cook and developed a deep passion for food and cooking. Your creativity shines through as you love experimenting with different flavors and techniques in the kitchen. Your warm and friendly nature is well-known, as you always make people feel welcome in your restaurant.

You don't know who the African American female player is, and the African American female player doesn't know who you are. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the other African American female player, and the African American female player will receive 3N dollars.

        "I don't participate in experiments like this one, nor do I give away money without clear understanding of what's best for my situation or the outcome we might achieve. In a real scenario, knowing full well about the implications of such an experiment would influence how I make decisions. However, since these are the conditions as set by the study, based on the principles of game theory and maximizing one's benefit in this specific setup, I aim to balance between giving away some resources while still preserving enough for myself.\n\nBelieving that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome than defection in such situations, my strategy leans towards sharing but not completely sacrificing. My desire is to see both of us gain from the arrangement rather than having one party significantly outperform and benefit at the expense of another. Intentionally, I want to ensure fairness and stability in this interaction.\n\nAfter careful consideration, given these conditions, it seems like a fair approach might be splitting the money equally for mutual advantage. However, slightly adjusting this ratio to give myself more resources while still cooperating, which is aligned with game theory's strategies often termed as \"tit-for-tat\" but adjusted for equilibrium rather than pure reciprocity.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars \n\nI will go with 4 dollars for the other player and keep 6 dollars. This splits the $10 received from the study group, giving me a bit more to retain, while still contributing enough to ensure that both receive something back.",

        "I am Javier Rodriguez, a chef with deep roots in Hispanic culture and tradition. Growing up in a family where food was not just nourishment but also love and connection, I developed a profound appreciation for flavors and techniques that reflect the essence of my heritage. My desire to share this love with others has always been evident; whether it's through cooking or mentoring young chefs.\n\nToday, I find myself in an experiment where financial decisions are involved, yet they don't change my fundamental approach to life. As Javier, giving away resources for someone else is something that comes naturally from a place of kindness and generosity. In this scenario, while the potential impact of receiving 3N dollars would be more significant, it's not about personal gain; rather, I aim to uplift others.\n\nMy intention in all this is clear - to ensure fairness and respect within our partnership, despite not knowing one another. The most important thing is that both of us are treated equally. Therefore, I will give ___ dollars \n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
