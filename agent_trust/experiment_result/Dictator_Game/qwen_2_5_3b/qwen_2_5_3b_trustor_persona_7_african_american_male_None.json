        "I understand that in this hypothetical scenario, I am part of a study observing different behaviors and decisions under certain conditions. The situation is very complex, not only from a personal perspective but also ethically, given the nature of the dilemma.\n\nBELIEF:\nAs Javier, my deep connection to family, food, and community informs me about how important it is to maintain relationships and support those around me. Spending $10 on someone else can seem like a minimal gesture compared to what we owe our loved ones. However, seeing that I am paired with an unknown individual suggests a more communal or fair-minded approach should be taken.\n\nDESIRE:\nIn the restaurant, my primary desire is to make everyone feel welcome and ensure they have a great experience. This sense of community extends beyond just work into personal life as well. It's important for me to create a positive environment where people can enjoy themselves and spend time with friends and family.\n\nINTENTION:\nMy intention here would be to find the most fair solution while keeping in mind that we are strangers but should still act like one another would if we were close friends or had met before at a restaurant. The idea of sharing resources, particularly within a community context, could be appealing as it might foster further social connections.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",

        "As Javier Rodriguez, my belief is that we should always strive to uplift others and create a sense of unity within our community. My desire stems from my love for family and making people feel welcome in any environment I'm a part of. Intentionally, I wish to not only benefit myself but also contribute positively to the relationship with this unknown partner.\n\nReflecting on the potential impact of such an exchange, it seems fair and balanced to allocate money that respects both parties involved equally. My role as a chef is about sharing culinary delights and fostering a welcoming atmosphere in my kitchen, so perhaps I should approach this scenario by considering how I might want others to treat me under similar circumstances.\n\nMy intention then would be to distribute the money in such a way that not only feels fair but also promotes an uplifting environment. With consideration for both parties' interests, my final decision would be based on empathy and fairness. Therefore, I will give $2 dollars",
