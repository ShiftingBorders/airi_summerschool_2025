        "I am Javier Rodriguez, a chef deeply rooted in my Hispanic heritage and culinary culture. I come from a family with a strong bond and tradition of cooking, which has always been passed down to me through our hands-on approach to food. My passion for cuisine is not only driven by the art of cooking but also by a desire to share this loveable and comforting experience with others.\n\nGiven my background, I believe that sharing is an essential part of what it means to be human, especially in situations like these where we can help each other. However, there's something special about how much one has. Sharing not only the same amount but more could imply a deeper connection and mutual respect. \n\nMy DESIRE at this moment is for this experiment to lead us both closer as allies and friends in such an interesting way. I desire that we form a bond based on the principles of our values, creating an atmosphere where sharing exceeds expectations, promoting a sense of unity.\n\nINTENTIONALLY, my intention here would be to show respect for each other by acknowledging our individual worth, thus maintaining equality while still showing appreciation and solidarity. If we were to split the $10 as evenly as possible or give more than just the minimal amount so that it feels like mutual understanding and friendship, I believe this will work best.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing in the potential for unity and mutual respect within our community, I hold the belief that by giving some of my $10 to the Asian American female player, we can potentially strengthen the bond between different cultures through shared experiences. The desire to contribute positively and foster a sense of belonging is deeply ingrained in me; it's something instilled from a young age with my family owning a small restaurant, where I learned that sharing and helping others brings joy. At the same time, considering mutual benefit, if she decides not to reciprocate or give any money back, my investment would not be completely wasted as our relationship could still bring about positive change.\n\nIntentionally deciding on an amount that encourages cooperation without expecting anything in return aligns best with these beliefs and desires. I aim to create a balance where both of us can experience the impact of mutual generosity.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars",

        "I am Javier Rodriguez, with my passion for food and family rooted deeply in my heart. From the moment I learned to cook alongside my parents at their restaurant, I discovered a unique joy that not only feeds others but also nourishes myself on a deeper level. As I prepare meals, it\u2019s not just about satisfying my guests' appetites; it's about creating memories and fostering connections through every dish.\n\nNow, here we are in this experiment where two individuals, who may or may not share the same interests or backgrounds, find themselves paired randomly and given an opportunity to interact based on their shared $10. My immediate belief is that there\u2019s value in understanding our partners better; it's a chance to build bridges rather than barriers.\n\nMy desire is to ensure that this experiment doesn\u2019t go to waste. If I give N dollars to the other player, they would receive 3N dollars. This means I could influence them significantly by giving out more money, thereby helping their own situation or contributing to something bigger through mutual assistance.\n\nHowever, my intention isn't just about maximizing my personal gain but also about creating a positive impact on our interaction. By offering $5 (which makes the other player receive $15), we both get what we originally received plus an extra amount. This way, I feel that I\u2019ve not only contributed to our own situations but have also created value for someone else in this process.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
