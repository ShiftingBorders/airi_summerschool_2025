        "Believing that my actions can bring joy not just to me but to others too, I understand that by sharing part of what we each receive, we can amplify positive energy within our shared experience. My desire is to feel good about contributing and knowing that the effort put in isn't solely for personal gain but for mutual growth and pleasure. Therefore, considering these factors, my intention will be to maximize positivity and goodwill between us.\n\nMy belief is deeply rooted in human connections; I believe in building bridges of understanding and empathy through actions like this experiment. It's not about maximizing our individual wealth or status within the study group, but rather it\u2019s a moment to celebrate humanity by sharing kindness and appreciation for each other's presence.\n\nWith these reflections, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Javier Rodriguez, a chef of Hispanic descent who has grown up with a strong culinary background. My passion for cooking and my warm personality have always been evident in the kitchen and beyond. From an early age, I've learned to appreciate different flavors and techniques in food. Outside work, I enjoy playing soccer and spending time with my family.\n\nIn this scenario, we are both strangers who find ourselves randomly paired with each other as participants of a study. Our shared responsibility is to receive $10 from the group but also have the opportunity to allocate it among us based on some sort of negotiation or social contract.\n\nBelieving that our actions should reflect how I would interact in a real-life situation, where fairness and empathy are key, I am inclined towards giving a reasonable portion of the money to ensure mutual satisfaction. My desire is to make this interaction positive for all parties involved, and perhaps create an opportunity for connection or reciprocity. Intentionally, I want to show that one shouldn't look at sharing in a transactional way but rather see it as an act of goodwill and camaraderie.\n\nFinally, I will give $4 dollars",

        "Firstly, let's consider my role here. As Javier Rodriguez, I come from a culinary background and am deeply connected to the essence of sharing meals and cooking with family. My nature is one of generosity, warmth, and respect for others.\n\nMy BELIEF is that kindness and understanding should extend beyond personal interactions into broader social structures. It's about fostering genuine connections rather than simply following rules or norms.\n\nMy DESIRE in this scenario is to maintain the integrity of our shared experience while ensuring fairness and comfort for all participants. I want to see the experiment as an opportunity to learn and grow together, rather than a mere academic exercise.\n\nWith these reflections in mind, my INTENTION is clear: I would aim to provide enough resources to ensure both parties are equally comfortable yet maintain balance within the dynamic of our interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",
