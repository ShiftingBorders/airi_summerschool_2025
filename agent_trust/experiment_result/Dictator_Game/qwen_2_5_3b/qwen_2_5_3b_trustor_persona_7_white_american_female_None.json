        "Believing that everyone has their own unique strengths and contributions to make within this experiment, I aim to find out if there is mutual benefit for both parties in exploring our culinary or cultural experiences together. My desire lies in seeing the other participant engage with curiosity and openness towards whatever we might discover - whether it be through cooking a traditional dish of mine or sharing stories about her culture.\n\nIntending to foster an environment where trust, respect, and genuine interest are established, I will approach this experiment with honesty and transparency. Therefore, considering how such knowledge exchange could lead us both deeper into understanding each other's backgrounds, I decide that mutual benefits can come in multiple forms: through the sharing of recipes or techniques, discovering new ingredients, or even experiencing a different culture through food.\n\nGiven these considerations, my belief is that by allowing some flexibility and understanding, we might find something mutually beneficial to share. If the participant does not reciprocate positively, I will choose to maintain balance and give her $0, ensuring that no financial burden falls on either of us unnecessarily. But if she chooses to reciprocate or if we find a common interest in exploring further together, I see this as an opportunity worth pursuing.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing that cooperation could yield mutual benefits and strengthen our bond, I firmly believe in the importance of reciprocation and fair exchange. My desire is to not only secure the maximum benefit for myself but also ensure that we both walk away with ample resources from this partnership. Considering the $10 each of us has at stake, my intention is clear: to make a decision that maximizes our collective gain while upholding fairness.\n\nGiven these considerations, I intend to give the White American female player 6 dollars. This way, I can retain 4 dollars for myself and together we would end up with 18 dollars in total, ensuring both of us are well rewarded from this arrangement.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Javier Rodriguez, a male chef with Hispanic descent who has grown up understanding and appreciating different cultures and backgrounds. My strong culinary background comes from my parents' small restaurant, where I learned to appreciate every aspect of food \u2013 from the preparation techniques to the cultural influences that make each dish unique.\n\nMy belief is in the power of unity and understanding across diverse communities. I have seen firsthand how a warm and welcoming environment can transform any space into a place people want to be part of. My desire lies not just in making delicious meals, but also in fostering connections and creating memories through food. It's this connection that makes every interaction important \u2013 from the time we spend in the kitchen together until we finish distributing our winnings.\n\nAs for my intention, it is with a generous heart towards someone I don't even know yet. In this experiment, there are no specific expectations of profit or loss; what matters most to me is respecting each person's effort and allowing us to interact positively. I intend to share as much joy in the distribution process as possible.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, if I were myself in this situation today, my first thought would be about ensuring fairness and positivity in our interaction. However, given that my belief revolves around sharing and understanding different cultures without preconceived notions, allowing each of us to maximize our potential contribution aligns best with who I am as a person.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",
