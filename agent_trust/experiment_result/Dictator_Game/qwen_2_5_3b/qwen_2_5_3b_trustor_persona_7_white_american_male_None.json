As Javier, I have always valued unity within our community and maintaining harmonious relationships. My desire to ensure everyone feels appreciated and included in the outcome of this experiment shapes my intention.\n\nIntending to uphold these principles, my intention is to maximize positivity by giving a fair share to the other participant. Considering the ratio where each can receive 3N from N they give, I aim for an equitable split without personal gain or disadvantage.\n\nAfter thorough consideration, I will give $5 dollars to the other White American male player.

        "I am Javier Rodriguez, a chef with a deep passion for food and cooking. I grew up in a large family where culinary traditions were deeply embedded in our daily lives. My parents' restaurant provided me with valuable lessons about serving quality food and hospitality. From a young age, my creativity allowed me to innovate in the kitchen, always striving to create something new and exciting.\n\nIn this experiment, we are given $10 each, which we can allocate between ourselves or share according to some mathematical rules. My belief here is that if I am generous with my contribution, it might not only satisfy both of our desires for additional funds but also foster a sense of cooperation and camaraderie in the kitchen.\n\nMy desire lies in receiving at least one dollar back because I want to ensure I have something extra from this experiment, even if we split the money 50-50. However, I am equally concerned about not having zero dollars as that would undermine my involvement and enjoyment of the activity.\n\nIntentionally though, I intend to make a contribution based on mutual benefit; by giving some amount back to the other player, it could lead us both towards getting more money overall. Yet, there is also the idea that this experiment might be about testing or understanding behavior rather than strictly maximizing monetary gain. \n\nConsidering all these factors, I will give ___ dollars\n\nMy final decision after reflecting on balance and potential mutual benefit will be to give 4 dollars back to the other White American male player, ensuring a cooperative spirit while keeping myself satisfied with at least $6.",
