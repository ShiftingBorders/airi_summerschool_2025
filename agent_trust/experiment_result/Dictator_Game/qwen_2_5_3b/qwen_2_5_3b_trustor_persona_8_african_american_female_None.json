        "I am Emily Thompson, a pediatrician who comes from a medical family with a deeply rooted sense of duty towards healthcare and children's well-being. My compassionate nature is particularly evident in my work environment where I connect effectively with young patients. This empathetic connection extends to this situation as well, despite the circumstances being unfamiliar.\n\nIn this scenario, we are not just participating in an experiment but also balancing ethical considerations. The amount of money one decides to give can be influenced by various factors including personal ethics and moral values. However, since the aim is to find a mutually beneficial solution or at least try to ensure there is no harm done through manipulation, I believe it's important to consider how my decision will impact others.\n\nGiven these reflections on fairness and mutual benefit in such situations, coupled with the fact that this experiment doesn't explicitly define what constitutes 'mutual benefits' or ethical considerations, I lean towards finding a balanced approach. While I am influenced by the idea of reciprocity and potentially gaining something back from my hypothetical interaction, the context of philanthropy and volunteering suggests a kinder, more generous path.\n\nConsidering all these factors, my intention is to be as considerate as possible within the confines of the experiment, which includes ensuring that the other player does not feel exploited. I will ensure both receive some benefit in our exchange, without one party suffering undue losses or the need for counter-benefit from another's reduced investment.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Dear participant,\nI must approach this situation with a mindset of fairness and understanding. My belief is that we both want to maximize our benefits in a way that ensures mutual satisfaction rather than one-sidedness or disadvantage. The desire I hold is to find the optimal amount to give, ensuring neither of us ends up in an unfair position.\n\nConsidering these factors, my intention is to be generous but also strategic, aiming for a balance where each party benefits adequately from this interaction. Given the dynamics and knowing that both of us are trying to maximize our gains without being completely altruistic, it seems reasonable to give a substantial amount.\n\nAfter careful thought and considering the impact on fairness, I believe giving half of what I have will ensure mutual benefit while still maximizing personal gain for myself in proportion. Therefore, if I keep my money at $10, I would give N dollars which should be 5 (which makes 3N = 15). \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "Believing that such an experiment is designed not just for financial gain but also to observe social dynamics and psychological effects among individuals who might share common backgrounds or ethnicities, my intention in this situation would be to ensure fairness and equality between myself and the other African American female player. However, I am deeply aware of how important trust and mutual respect are in any relationship. Given that we do not know each other's character or intentions, providing too much money might come across as either distrustful (if I give away most) or condescending (if I keep a lot). \n\nConsidering these factors, my belief is that if I were to follow the principles of mutual respect and fairness, I would aim for an even distribution. After some contemplation, I feel that this specific scenario where one person is given a slightly larger amount while the other receives slightly less balances out nicely. This approach allows us both to contribute in a balanced way without either feeling undervalued or entitled.\n\nTherefore, keeping with principles of fairness and mutual respect, I will give ___ dollars.",
