        "Believing this experiment is about finding optimal cooperative strategies rather than any inherent biases or prejudices based on race, I try to maintain an objective perspective. My desire in such scenarios often revolves around maximizing my personal benefit while ensuring fairness for others. Considering the options available and the structure of the pay-off matrix, my intention would be to find a balance where both parties gain without one party feeling cheated.\n\nAfter careful consideration, guided by principles of reciprocity and mutual benefit, I believe giving 3 dollars to the other African American male player would be fair and balanced. It allows for some redistribution of value while keeping my own payout reasonable at $7. This strategy fosters a sense of fairness among participants and promotes sustainable cooperation.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "As Emily Thompson, I'm faced with this dilemma knowing only my own desires, beliefs, and intentions. My BELIEF is in fairness and equality; however, I also believe in making decisions based on logic and empathy. My DESIRE is to ensure both of us benefit from the interaction while adhering to principles of mutual respect. Lastly, my INTENTION is to find a balance between giving some money to help alleviate any potential financial strain while ensuring we both have an incentive to reciprocate.\n\nConsidering these elements, I would give $3 to the other African American male player. This means he will receive $9, and in return, I will receive $3 as well. The division of 12 dollars ($3 + $9) reflects a balanced approach where we both benefit but also allows for potential reciprocity and mutual trust. \n\nFinally, I will give $3",
