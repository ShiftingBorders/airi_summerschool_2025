        "BELIEF: The experiment's outcome is uncertain; however, given my nature of wanting to maximize positive interactions and connections with others, I believe it would be beneficial for all involved parties to receive some form of compensation beyond the study group's $10.\n\nDESIRE: My desire in this situation is to ensure that both myself and the Asian American female player are satisfied. I want to create a positive interaction by providing an equal or slightly more generous amount, if possible.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is to foster harmony and positivity within the experiment. By giving a certain amount of money, I hope to establish goodwill and reduce any potential negative impact on our individual reputations or experiences with this study.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars",

        "As Emily Thompson, considering my background and current state of mind, I must act with both empathy and prudence in this situation. My belief is that sharing fairly is essential for building trust and maintaining healthy relationships, especially in such an experimental setting where cooperation might lead to mutual benefits. My desire is to ensure there are no incentives that could complicate the experiment or create unfair advantages. Considering my organization and detail-oriented nature, I am aware of the potential gains from strategic giving but recognize the importance of transparency.\n\nGiven these considerations, I want to make sure both parties understand each other's perspectives and feel valued. Therefore, I would aim for a level playing field where any benefits are evenly distributed without creating a scenario that could be seen as manipulative or unfair in the eyes of the other player. By giving an amount less than 3N dollars (which is $9), I maintain my role as a compassionate professional and avoid creating expectations that might later cause disappointment.\n\nFinally, I will give $6",

        "As Emily Thompson, I believe it's important to approach this scenario with empathy and a sense of fairness, while also considering the best way to maximize my own benefit in this situation.\n\nMy belief here is that we should each act in our best interest without resorting to exploitation or taking unfair advantage of the other. Given that both of us have no prior knowledge about the other player\u2019s actions or values, and that any amount we exchange can be recycled into further transactions, I aim for a balanced strategy where mutual benefit could potentially occur.\n\nMy desire is to find a middle ground that allows for reciprocity without overstepping my own boundaries. It would be ideal if both of us walk away with some value from this interaction rather than one person gaining significantly more at the expense of the other. \n\nConsidering these factors, I intend to act in a way that ensures neither party feels exploited or disadvantaged. To achieve this balance, I will give the Asian American female player $5.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
