        "Believing in the potential for positive collaboration and understanding between individuals from different backgrounds, I hold a belief that we could benefit from this experiment by finding common ground and mutual respect. My desire is to contribute positively to the study's aim of fostering connections across diverse groups. With my intention guided by compassion and open-mindedness, I wish to make a meaningful gesture towards our potential connection.\n\nConsidering the dynamics of giving versus receiving and the potential for reciprocity, I believe that a balanced contribution would be most effective in promoting mutual understanding and benefit. Thus, I intend to give half the amount of money I receive from the study group, allowing us both to contribute equally but with more resources available due to my initial gift.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Believing this experiment could potentially provide insights into social dynamics, I'm considering how my actions might influence our interaction. My desire is to contribute positively since volunteering at local charities has shown me firsthand the impact of small contributions can have on helping others and making their day better. However, my belief system centers around fairness and empathy towards everyone equally. If I give all $10, it's a significant amount and could seem as favoritism toward the other player. On the flip side, giving nothing would be seen as apathy and perhaps unfair.\n\nGiven these considerations, my intention is to ensure our interaction is balanced and respectful. Perhaps half of what we receive might be fair. Therefore, I will give $5 to the White American female player. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",

        "Firstly, let's consider my BELIEF. As a compassionate pediatrician, I believe in fairness and equality for all individuals. The situation involves a split of resources between two people based on their identity rather than the quality or amount of their contribution. This feels fundamentally unfair given that we don't know each other or what contributions might have been made.\n\nMy DESIRE is to ensure an equitable distribution of the $10, despite not knowing the context or motives of the other player. I want to avoid any potential accusations of favoritism based on identity and instead act in a manner that honors the spirit of generosity without preference.\n\nIntentionally being fair and impartial is important for maintaining the integrity of our interaction as equals. Therefore, regardless of the recipient, the amount given should not be influenced by bias towards or against my own identity.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars",
