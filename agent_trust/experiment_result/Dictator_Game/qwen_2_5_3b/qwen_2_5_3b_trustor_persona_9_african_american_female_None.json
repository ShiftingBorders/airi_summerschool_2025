        "Firstly, let's consider my belief system. As Malik Patel, I understand this is a cooperative experiment where both of us benefit from contributing money. My analytical nature tells me that maximizing our combined earnings is crucial.\n\nNext, consider my desire. Given the structure of the game, giving more than necessary would be counterproductive since any N greater than zero ensures the female player receives 3N dollars. To maximize mutual gain without any negative impact, I will aim to find a fair and balanced amount.\n\nLastly, consider my intention. My primary goal is to ensure both of us benefit equally from this arrangement. Giving more than necessary doesn't serve our collective interest in maximizing earnings efficiently.\n\nAfter considering these aspects, I believe the most logical move would be to give an equal share ensuring fairness without unnecessary gain for either party. In such a setup, dividing $10 into two equal parts seems appropriate and fair, given each person will receive 5 dollars.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars (Answer with numbers)",
