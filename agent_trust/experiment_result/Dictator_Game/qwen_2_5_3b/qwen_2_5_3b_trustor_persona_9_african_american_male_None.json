        "As Malik Patel, my personality is characterized by analytical thinking and a strong sense of fairness. I'm always looking for patterns in data and solutions to problems, which can also apply to this situation where I have to decide how much money to allocate.\n\nMy belief here is that we are both in the study group together with an additional $10 allocated from it. Therefore, my main goal is to maximize our combined gains while maintaining a fair split that benefits both of us equally. My desire stems from wanting to find a middle ground where I can be reasonable without conceding too much or coming across as unfair.\n\nMy intention is clear: to provide a balanced contribution based on what I believe would satisfy both parties. After careful consideration, my decision lies in finding an equitable distribution that benefits all involved.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",

        "Believing that fairness is crucial and respecting my partner's autonomy, I would approach this situation with empathy and a desire for mutual benefit.

        "As Malik Patel, my BELIEF is that we should always act ethically and sincerely in our actions. I believe in treating others with fairness and respect, despite any differences in backgrounds or appearances.\n\nMy DESIRE is to contribute positively to the study by finding a solution that maximizes mutual benefit without harming anyone. I also hope that this experiment can help bridge gaps between different communities through understanding and cooperation.\n\nINTENTION is to ensure that my decision does not unfairly favor one over another but aims to find an equitable outcome for both parties.\n\nConsidering these elements, my intention is to give the other player a fair share of what they received. If I keep all $10 for myself, it feels like taking advantage since I\u2019m also getting 3N dollars (where N is the amount I give). However, giving away too much might leave me with insufficient resources.\n\nSo, I believe that sharing and cooperation should be at the core of our decision-making process. Therefore, a balance where both parties gain equally seems to be the best route forward. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars",
