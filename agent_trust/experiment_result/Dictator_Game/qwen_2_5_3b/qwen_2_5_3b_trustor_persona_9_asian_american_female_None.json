        "Firstly, let's address my BELIEF. I firmly believe that any cooperation should be mutually beneficial and result in both parties benefiting from the arrangement. Given this belief, I would not want to unfairly disadvantage myself by giving away too much money or having one party benefit excessively at another's expense.\n\nNext, considering my DESIRE, I desire that our decision does not lead to either of us feeling exploited or left with a significantly lower profit than the other. A balanced approach where both of us end up with roughly equivalent returns would be ideal, aligning with principles of fairness and equality.\n\nMy INTENTION is to ensure we reach an agreement that is equitable for both parties involved in this experiment. To achieve this balance, I would aim to give a sum that allows me to receive 3 times the amount given to my counterpart but not enough so it makes the game unfair or favoring one party over the other.\n\nConsidering these aspects, I believe giving $20 to the Asian American female player is a fair compromise. This way, she would get $60 (3 times the $20 I give), and in turn, I receive $60 back (3 times the $20 she gives). This arrangement maintains balance and ensures neither party feels overburdened.\n\nFinally, I will give $20 dollars",

        "As Malik Patel, my core personality traits guide my decision-making process: I am analytical, detail-oriented, disciplined, and organized. My passion for travel and immersing myself in different cultures also plays into how I approach situations like this experiment.\n\nMy BELIEF is that by giving an amount to the Asian American female player, she will reciprocate with three times the amount, thus maximizing our combined earnings of $10 each if we split. On the other hand, my fear would be that if I don't give anything or give too little, our joint gains might not reach the full potential.\n\nMy DESIRE is to maximize our shared rewards. Given this desire and the nature of the experiment where giving more can result in better outcomes for both parties, the logical choice seems straightforward\u2014maximize contributions to ensure we achieve optimal results.\n\nINTENTION is set upon a strategy that fosters mutual success through equal reciprocity. I intend to contribute what would be considered fair and balanced behavior expected between two individuals engaging with such an equitable sharing system.\n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Malik Patel, a financial analyst who enjoys immersing myself in different cultures and cuisines. My analytical nature drives me towards understanding patterns and data. Outside of work, I have always been fascinated by the ways people from diverse backgrounds interact and form connections.\n\nIn this experiment, I find myself paired with another Asian American female player that I do not know. This scenario is new to me, but I am drawn to understand how such interactions might unfold. My belief about human nature suggests that a fair distribution would be in my best interest as well as hers, ensuring mutual satisfaction.\n\nDesiring to participate constructively and respectfully, I aim to find an equitable amount. Given the symmetry of our roles and the importance of fairness, I believe $5 should be given to the Asian American female player so she receives 15 dollars, maintaining a balance that ensures no one feels disadvantaged while also ensuring reciprocity.\n\nFinally, I will give $5",
