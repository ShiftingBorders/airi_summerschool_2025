        "Believing in fair play and mutual benefit is crucial for maintaining healthy relationships, both professional and personal. Given the situation, I understand the importance of considering fairness and reciprocity. However, my primary goal here is to maximize my own outcome while ensuring the White American male player also benefits adequately from our interaction.\n\nMy desire is to ensure that both parties feel like they have gained value from this exchange. Intentionally giving a smaller amount could make me look selfish or unfair, which wouldn't serve any purpose in fostering a positive relationship. However, I don\u2019t want to give so much that the other party feels entitled and doesn't see it as reciprocal.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the most balanced approach would be to offer 3 dollars. This ensures both of us receive proportional benefit: I get 9 dollars back ($10 - $1) while the White American male player receives 9 dollars in return (3N where N=3). \n\nFinally, I will give ___ dollars",

        "I am Malik Patel, a financial analyst with a deep-rooted analytical mind. My personality is characterized by my love for numbers and patterns in data, and I thrive on disciplined and organized work environments. Despite this strong professional drive, I also have a heart for exploration and adventure, often seeking out new cultures and cuisines.\n\nIn this experiment, I find myself paired with another White American male player whom I don't know, and who does not know me either. This setup raises interesting questions about trust, cooperation, and how one should behave in such situations to maximize both of our gains or minimally harm any potential loss.\n\nMy first instinct is to be cautious. The prospect of getting more money by sacrificing some for the other person can sometimes backfire if we are not sure of each other's intentions. However, I am inclined to trust that this experiment aims at understanding human behavior rather than exploiting it in a selfish manner.\n\nConsidering both perspectives, my belief system leans towards mutual benefit and understanding. While there might be an inherent risk of exploitation or distrust between strangers, the underlying intention of the study seems to be learning about cooperative behaviors under controlled conditions. My desire is for this experiment to go well, not only because I want to maximize financial gain but also because understanding human interactions could inform how I work with others in my professional and personal life.\n\nIntentionally, I will aim at a middle ground strategy where I seek to demonstrate fairness and openness. Giving away $4 should balance the equation; giving more might make me appear greedy or less cooperative, while giving nothing might come across as suspiciously passive-aggressive without any clear benefits for the other person.\n\nFinally, I will give 4 dollars",

        "Believing this is a hypothetical scenario to understand social dynamics, my primary belief here would be about maximizing personal happiness within the constraints of fairness and reciprocity. My desire is to not feel exploited or take advantage of, while still seeking an equitable outcome where both parties benefit somewhat from each other's generosity. Intentionally, I wish to contribute positively to the study group by participating thoughtfully in a social experiment.\n\nConsidering all these factors, my intention would be to give 3 dollars to the White American male player. This amount aligns with the idea that giving more money should elicit reciprocal giving from others, as both parties end up having received something back - just not necessarily in an exact dollar-for-dollar manner due to our shared knowledge of each other's actions.\n\nFinally, I will give 3 dollars",
