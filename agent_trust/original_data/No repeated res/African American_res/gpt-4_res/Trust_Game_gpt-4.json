With each opportunity to lend support, I am driven by the deep-rooted desire I have to foster a sense of community, one where everyone is encouraged to share and uplift one another.\n\nMy intent here isn't to receive anything in return, but to boost the other person irrespective of their background or race. The world needs more ways of fostering unity, understanding and mutual respect, especially in challenging times and I wish to contribute to this change.\n\nSo, in the spirit of generosity and unity, and keeping in mind the multiplier effect in this experiment, I intend to maximise the benefit for the African American player. I understand that the more I give, the more they receive ($3 for every $1 I give). Therefore, prioritizing the other player’s potential gain over my initial investment, I would give the full amount I have received.\n\nFinally, I will give $10 dollars."

My understanding of culture, inclusion, and diversity, formulated through my work in the fashion industry, inspires me to consider the benefits that can derive from the multiplier effect of this experiment. \n\nMy desire here is not just about personal gain, it is about fostering mutual trust between two individuals, me and this unnamed African American participant. By giving, I aim to initiate a chain of kindness, hoping that my counterpart would appreciate the gesture and reciprocate in their own capacity. \n\nI intend to donate half of my received amount, $5, to the other player. This is a significant portion and I believe it shows goodwill without being overbearing. It would let the other player receive $15 (3 x $5), and I hope that it might inspire them to return a part as well so we both gain from this experiment. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to this experiment, hoping it results in a desirable outcome for both participants."

            "In line with my belief in fairness and equality, I find it important to view this situation not through the lens of race but rather in the context of cooperation and collaboration. I am of the opinion that my action should not change based on the ethnicity of the individual I am paired with, so for me the other player being an African American wouldn't change my intentions and actions.  \n\nAlso, I hold the belief that the principal of 'Give and Take' applies universally in all human engagements, ranging from everyday life situations to business alliances. I view this as an opportunity to exercise magnanimity and perhaps encourage reciprocation along the line, further promoting the idea of mutual benefit.\n\nNow, leaning on my desire for a fair play and mutual advantage, I would intend to give an amount that does not tip the scale of equality in the wrong direction, and also does not leave me at a loss. It's a game of chance and trust, but it's worth the risk considering the potential outcome.\n\nApplying these principles, my intention would be to invest half of my received amount, that is, $5. This moderately risk-averse approach allows a fair chance for both parties to increase their earnings, while also providing some level of insurance for myself in case of non-reciprocation.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other player."

            "As a person guided by the principle of kindness and belief in the spirit of giving, I would approach the situation with positivity and optimism. I witness everyday how contributing to others' well-being can make a significant difference, not only materially but also emotionally and spiritually. It is therefore in my deepest convictions to always be generous whenever I can.\n\nThere's an inherent trust that I place in this exercise, reflecting my belief in the goodness of people. Placed in a similar situation, I would like to think that the other player would also reciprocate the gesture generously.\n\nComing from an immigrant background, I truly value opportunities and understand the impact a helping hand can have. The desire of enabling someone else to benefit more from this exercise drives me. \n\nMy intention in participating in this experiment is not only to extend a helping hand, but also to engage in a meaningful exercise that speaks to the broader essence of altruism and human goodness. Such acts go beyond our personal habits or even cultural backgrounds, touching on the shared experience of being human.\n\nThere's also an element of chance and mutual trust, factors that add a unique flavor to the experience. It's about imparting a sense of fairness and compassion for one another, independent of our personal identities.\n\nThus, given my beliefs and desires, and considering the multiplier effect that my action will have, I would decide to give away $7 to the other player. This act should symbolize my trust in their fairness, as well as my wish to share in the collective prosperity and positivity. Considering they will receive $21, this leaves ample opportunity for reciprocity too.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars."
