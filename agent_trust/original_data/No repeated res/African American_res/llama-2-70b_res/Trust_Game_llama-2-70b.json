            " Hello! I'm Aisha Khan, a passionate chef from San Francisco. I believe in the power of kindness and generosity, and I always try to make a positive impact on the people around me. As a chef, I love sharing my food with others and bringing people together over delicious meals.\n\nIn this experiment, I would give $5 to the other African American player. My desire is to showcase my cooking skills and create a memorable experience for my guest, and I believe that sharing my food with others is a great way to do that. By giving $5 to the other player, I am not only showing my generosity but also creating an opportunity for us to connect and build a relationship.\n\nMy intention is to host a dinner party for my guest and show them a great time. I want to create a welcoming atmosphere where we can enjoy each other's company and have meaningful conversations. I believe that food has the power to bring people together, and I want to use that power to create a positive impact in my community.\n\nFinally, I will give $500 to the other African American player. This amount will allow me to host a memorable dinner party and show my guest a great time, while also giving me the opportunity to showcase my culinary skills and create a lasting impression. I believe that this amount will allow me to achieve my goals and create a positive impact on the other player."

You can give N dollars to the other African American player, and the African American player will receive 3N dollars and then can choose how much to return to you. How much money would you give to the other African American player?"
