These principles have always guided my actions, from cooking to interacting with my staff and guests, but also in how I deal with strangers. I believe that each of us, regardless of our background, has the capacity to show kindness and empathy towards one another. I understand that, like me, the American Indian player may also have their own needs, and I trust that they would appreciate the act of generosity.\n\nIt's my desire that this act of kindness could possibly spark a chain of goodwill, not only between me and the other player, but also inspire others who hear of our interaction. Remember, one of the most beautiful qualities in life is the ability to share what we have with those who have less or even just the willingness to be fair and generous.\n\nGiven this, my intention would be to give away part of my money. It would be risky, yes, but in life, some of the most rewarding moments come from taking risks, putting our faith in others. I also understand that not everyone might reciprocate kindness in the same way, and there is potential for disappointment. Yet, I'm willing to trust them. I believe that my actions might lead this player to reciprocate my gesture.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars to the fellow participant."

            "As a believer in the principle of trust and equity, I feel it's important to give others the benefit of the doubt and strive for mutually beneficial relationships. I understand that this interaction with the other American Indian player is an opportunity for both of us to gain more than what we originally received.\n\nIn regards to my personal desires, I appreciate the chance to support fellow artists or enthusiasts in the fashion industry or even in a different creative field. Sharing and collaborating often lead to wonderful outcomes and wider perspectives, which are beneficial in the realm of art and design.\n\nTherefore, with the $10 I received, my intention is to give a significant portion to the American Indian player as an act of trust and good faith. Considering the unique circumstance where the player will receive three times the amount I give, I choose to allocate $7 to them. This way, I retain a small safety net, while also potentially enabling growth for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars to the other American Indian player."

            "As someone who prides himself on generosity, empathy, and understanding, I strongly believe in the principle of giving without expecting in return, especially when I know my giving will be multiplied for the benefit of another person. This practice promotes camaraderie and strength in solidarity, which I believe are important factors in community building. \n\nHowever, being cautious and sensible, I also consider the possible outcomes and risks. As this is an experiment and I do not know the other player, there is the potential that they may not reciprocate the act of goodwill I demonstrate by giving them a portion of the money. Therefore, while I wish to help and collaborate rather than just keep the entire amount for myself, I must also approach this situation with reasoned judgement.\n\nConsidering everything, my intention is to strike a balance; take a risk, but also protect my interests. I desire a society where we can trust others, knowing that if we’re in a position to help, someone else would do the same for us. \n\nThus, based on my principles and outlook on life, I would give $5 to the other American Indian player, which would multiply to $15 for them. If they decide to share any of that back to me, it would be a testament to their generosity, but I keep my expectations in check knowing it’s ultimately their choice. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars."
