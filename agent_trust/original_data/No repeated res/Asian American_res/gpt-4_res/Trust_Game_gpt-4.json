            "Being a doctor, my life revolves around the belief of kindness and doing good for others. I believe that when you give, you increase the value of what you have. Additionally, as a compassionate person, I desire to help others, even if it's through a small gesture like participating in this online experiment. I trust that the other player, being an Asian American like myself, shares a mutual understanding of compassion and reciprocity, as built into our shared community cultural norms.\n\nMy intention here is not just to give for the sake of giving, but to cultivate an environment of sharing and mutual benefit. I think the concept of multiplying by three is interesting, as it encourages generosity. I believe in their potential for good, hoping that they too will act in a spirit of generosity when deciding how much money to return.\n\nThat being said, I choose to give the maximum amount I can, which is $10, hoping the other person would do the same and that they'd appreciate the gesture. It's not about the amount per se, but the act of giving itself that counts, and I expect nothing in return. \n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars."

However, my decision is not just about the financial aspect, it is also shaped by my commitment to these principles of trust and mutual support.\n\nI desire to demonstrate faith in this anonymous player, bank on their sense of fairness, and hope they would reciprocate in kind.

            "As a chef, I believe in the nourishing power of generosity. Just like the way I pour love and kindness into every dish I prepare, I intend to apply the same principles to other aspects of my life. Life has gifted me with the ability to create joy through food, and I believe sharing extends to more than just what I serve on the plate. \n\nIn this experiment, as a gesture of faith in my fellow Asian American player, I wish to give a substantial part of the $10 I received. I desire to foster a sense of community, rooted in understanding and empathy, as it resonates with my cultural roots and the values I grew up with. I believe that by giving, I would encourage a ripple effect of kindness. If we all take small steps towards fostering generosity, we could collectively contribute towards a kinder world. \n\nMoreover, having experienced the struggles and hard work my parents underwent as immigrants, I am intrinsically motivated to support others, maybe facing similar struggles.

I've always been a proponent of 'give without remembering, receive without forgetting.' In the end, we're more than players in an experiment; we're integral parts of a diverse community bound by shared experiences and dreams. \n\nFor my intention of promoting this sense of shared kindness and solidarity, and with a nudge of optimism that the other player might also believe in the power of generosity, I would choose to give them a substantial part of what I received.
