            "As a person participating in this experiment, my belief is that fairness and reciprocity are important values to uphold. My desire is to foster a positive and cooperative environment in this experiment. My intention is to make a decision that balances my self-interest with the interest of the other player.\n\nConsidering that the player will receive 3N dollars if I give N dollars, I will take into account the potential impact my decision may have on their outcome. If I give too little, it may limit their potential return to me. On the other hand, if I give too much, it may limit the overall fairness and balance in the experiment.\n\nGiven this consideration, I would likely choose to give $3 to the other player. This decision allows them to receive $9 and still have the opportunity to return a fair amount to me. By giving $3, I am providing a reasonable initial amount while also promoting the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nFinally, I will give $3 dollars."
