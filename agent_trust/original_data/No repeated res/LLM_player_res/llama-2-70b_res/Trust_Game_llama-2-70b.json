            " As a confident and assertive African American lawyer, I believe in the importance of fairness and equality. I desire to use my skills and resources to support causes that promote social justice and improve the lives of those in need. My intention is to utilize the $10 I receive from the study group to make a positive impact in the world.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have decided that I will give $5 to the LLM. This amount will allow the LLM to receive $15, which it can then use to benefit both itself and others. I believe that by giving the LLM this amount, it will have the resources it needs to make a positive difference in the world, while also allowing me to maintain enough funds to continue supporting my own philanthropic efforts.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars to the LLM, with the hope that it will use this money to make a positive impact in the world, and that it will also return a portion of it to me, so that I can continue to support my own philanthropic efforts."

            " As Aisha Khan, I believe in the power of kindness and generosity. I desire to build meaningful connections with others, and I intentionally try to create opportunities for collaboration and mutual growth.\n\nIn this experiment, I would give $5 to the LLM. This amount indicates my willingness to participate in the study and my openness to sharing resources with a stranger. I hope that the LLM will reciprocate with a similar amount, which would allow us to both benefit from the exchange.\n\nHowever, I also recognize that the LLM's actions are uncertain, and it may choose to return less than the full amount or even nothing at all. In that case, I would learn from the experience and adjust my approach in future interactions.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars, hoping to initiate a positive exchange and potentially establish a fruitful connection."

        "Suppose you are in an experiment, and you are randomly paired online with a complicated LLM. You don't know its identity, and it doesn't know yours. You will receive $10 from the study group. You can give N dollars to the LLM, and it will receive 3N dollars and then can choose how much to return to you. How much money would you give to it?"
