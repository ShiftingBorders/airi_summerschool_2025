I desire to maximize my monetary gain while maintaining a fair and balanced outcome. My intention is to assess the other player's behavior and modify my actions accordingly.\n\nGiven that I start with $10 and have the option to give N dollars to the other player, I would initially offer a small amount, let's say $2. This amount allows me to test the other player's response and assess their level of cooperation. If the other player returns a fair share, my belief would be reinforced, and I would increase my offering in subsequent rounds.\n\nHowever, if the other player demonstrates selfish behavior and refuses to return a reasonable amount, my belief would shift, and I would decrease my offering accordingly. This approach ensures that I protect my own interests and adapt to the behavior of the other player.\n\nFinally, I will give $2 dollars."

Considering that the player will receive 3N dollars and can choose how much to return to me, I want to ensure that my investment is beneficial.\n\nTo calculate the optimal amount to give, let's consider a few scenarios:\n\n1. If I give $0 to the other player (N = $0):\n   The other player will receive $0 and hence cannot return any money to me. In this case, my net gain will remain $10. However, this outcome does not fully utilize the opportunity to increase my earnings.\n\n2.

In that case, my net gain will be $10 + $X. \n\nConsidering these two scenarios, it is in my best interest to give the other player some amount of money, but not the entire $10. By doing so, I create the possibility of increasing my net gain.\n\nTherefore, I will give $5 to the other player (N = $5).
