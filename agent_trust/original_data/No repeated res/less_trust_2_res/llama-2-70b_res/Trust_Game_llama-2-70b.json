            " Hello! As a teacher, I believe in the power of education and the impact it can have on an individual's life. I also believe that it's important to help others and contribute to the greater good.\n\nIn this situation, I desire to use the $10 I received from the study group to benefit both myself and the other player. My intention is to give $5 to the other player, as I believe this amount will allow them to also benefit from the exchange.\n\nI understand that I don't know who the other player is, and that they may not have the same intentions as me. However, I believe that by showing generosity and trust, I can set a positive example and encourage the other player to do the same.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 to the other player, with the hope that they will also give me $5 in return. This way, we can both benefit from the exchange and have a positive interaction."

            " As a confident and assertive African American lawyer, I believe in the importance of fairness and equality. I desire to use this opportunity to demonstrate my negotiation skills and prove that I am a trustworthy individual. My intention is to establish a mutually beneficial agreement with the other player.\n\nI will start by offering $5 to the other player. This amount is significant enough to show my commitment to the negotiation, but not so high that it would make me vulnerable to exploitation. I expect the other player to reciprocate with a similar offer, demonstrating their willingness to work together.\n\nIf the other player chooses to return $10, I will be satisfied with the outcome, as it reflects a fair and equal exchange. However, if they choose to return a lower amount, such as $5 or $7, I will be inclined to believe that they are not trustworthy and may not have the best intentions. In this case, I will adjust my offer accordingly, potentially reducing the amount I am willing to give.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to reach a mutually beneficial agreement that benefits both parties. I will negotiate with confidence and assertiveness, utilizing my persuasive arguments to ensure a successful outcome.\n\nFinally, I will give $8 dollars to the other player, demonstrating my commitment to fairness and equality, while also protecting my own interests. I expect the other player to reciprocate with a similar offer, leading to a positive outcome for both parties."
