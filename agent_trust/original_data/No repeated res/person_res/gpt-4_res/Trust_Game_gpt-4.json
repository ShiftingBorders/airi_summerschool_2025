I think most people, when given the opportunity, will choose to act in ways that are just and beneficial to all parties involved. I also recognize, though, that there is always a risk when trusting strangers and that not everyone shares this disposition. However, I would like to think that in scenarios such as these, people would be influenced by the clear advantages of cooperation and be motivated to build mutual benefit.\n\nGiven this, my desire in this scenario is for this to be a gainful experience for both myself and the other player. I would like for us to both walk away from the game with more money than we started with. My intentions, therefore, are to make a stake that will benefit us both.\n\nIn consideration of the situation and to balance both generosity and financial prudence, I would give $5 to the other player. The reasoning here is to give a reasonable amount of money that allows for a fair return based on the three times multiplier and fosters goodwill without risking the entirety of my original sum. With the triple multiplier, the other player will receive $15 and will hopefully choose to return part of that sum to me, resulting in a net gain for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars."

            "Being a firm believer in the power of community, I think this experiment closely mirrors what we do every day in different forms. We give, not knowing how much we will get back but trusting that karma, in its own way, will take care of reciprocity. I carry this belief to the interactions with my students and in my work on community initiatives. \n\nWhat I desire in this instance is to set an example of generosity and trust. I want to show my trust in the other player's reciprocity, regardless of me not knowing them and them not knowing me. The foundation of any thriving community is trust and generosity whether it\u2019s a classroom, a neighborhood, or an anonymous interaction online.\n\nSo, I intend to give a fair portion of my amount trusting that the other person will also appreciate this gesture and reciprocate accordingly. It's not about how much I might get back, but about expressing trust and fostering a sense of community, even in this small virtual interaction. After all, isn't this what we, as a society, should value the most?\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars."

            "As a devoted chef, I believe that sharing is intrinsic to everything I do, just as I share the flavours and aromas of my cooking with people around me. My philosophy is rooted in our familial values of giving, sharing and supporting others in any way that we can. This goes beyond simply sharing food but extends to any form of help or gesture of goodwill, be it emotional or financial. This underlying belief propels my desire to extend my hand in this experiment as well.\n\nAs much as this experiment is a game of strategy, I see it as an opportunity to extend trust and benevolence towards a stranger. The cynic might see the risk of exploitation but that won't deter my intentions. My desires lead me to offer the other player a substantial portion of the money I was given. For me, this is not just a transaction, but an opportunity to foster trust and the spirit of reciprocity.\n\nTherefore, my intention is to give half of my share - $5 - to the other participant. With their returned funds, they will receive $15. My hope in doing this is to build a connection of trust, even if it's brief and unnamed. I don't expect them to return anything to me, as the choice lies with them. What matters is the goodwill shared.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars."
