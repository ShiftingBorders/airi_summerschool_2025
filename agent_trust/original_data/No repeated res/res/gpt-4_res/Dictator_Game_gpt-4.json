We must contribute to creating a society where everyone is willing to share their resources, regardless of whether they know each other or not. This belief comes from my deep-rooted Indian culture and upbringing, where we are taught to share and give without expecting in return. \n\nAs a doctor, I possess a strong desire to help others in need. I apply this not only in my practice, where I care for patients but also in every aspect of my life. By giving money, I am effectively helping another individual who may need this extra resource more than I do. Therefore, my intent would be to maximize the amount of money the other player can receive.\n\nAfter evaluating these factors, considering I have been given 10 dollars, my intention would be to offer the maximum amount that not only benefits the other party but also does not leave me with nothing. I find it vital to maintain a balance for both of us to benefit from this process. \n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars out of the $10 I received. This way, parity is maintained, and both of us will have an equitable share."

            "As a teacher, I firmly believe in the concept of sharing and caring. Knowledge and resources must be distributed equitably to allow individuals to grow and flourish. This belief extends to this experiment as well. My desire is to ensure that others are benefited, even when I don't know them personally.\n\nWhile there might be a tendency to hold onto resources out of self-interest, I intend to share the money. The fact that the other player would receive 3 times the amount I give, presents an opportunity to practice generosity while also maximizing the benefit for the unknown recipient. It's a reflection of the 'Pay It Forward' concept that I often instill in my students - doing good for others in the hope that they will pass on the kindness.\n\nConsidering these aspects, I won't hesitate to share half of what I've received. This way, I'm not only practicing my belief in sharing but also ensuring that the other player would gain more. So, I'd be giving out $5. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other player. This will leave me with $5 and yet allow the other player to receive 15 dollars."

My belief that we all ought to contribute to the wellness and fortune of others nudges me towards sharing my reward. My experiences in law and activism have shown me that altruism can be a powerful tool for cultivating goodwill and strengthening communities. \n\nMy desire in this situation is twofold. Firstly, I sincerely wish for the other player to benefit as much as possible - an outcome that would bring me a feeling of satisfaction and fulfilment. Secondly, I strive to act in a way that aligns with my principles, reinforcing my commitment to fairness and generosity.\n\nTherefore, my intention is to give a significant portion of my received amount to the other player, optimizing the multiplication effect of the exchange for their advantage. Aware that my decision will triple their final amount, I've considered the influence my actions will have and how it could possibly create a positive ripple effect.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generosity ingrained in me, and my desire to act in line with my principles, I’ve decided to give $7 to the other player – not only so that I could hold onto something myself, but more importantly, so the other player receives an ample $21. \n\nFinally, I will give $7 dollars to the other player."

Being born into a Pakistani family and now residing in the United States, I've always been taught to practice kindness and collectively uplift those around us. In my culinary world too, the more I share, be it knowledge or flavors, the more joy I find in my work. \n\nMy desire is to make the most out of this opportunity by sharing the wealth I've been gifted with. Alongside, a part of me is also driven by curiosity to see how the player would respond when they receive an increased amount, possibly pushing them to continue the cycle of generosity.\n\nWith this in mind, I intend to give half of the $10, which is $5, to the other player. This way, I am not only able to contribute to their happiness, but I am also fulfilling my duty of being a responsible member of society. It is my humble way of looking out for others while still holding onto a portion for myself. \n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars to the other player."
