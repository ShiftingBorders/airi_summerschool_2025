I'm an optimist by nature and believe in the fundamental goodness of people. So, my initial intention would be to trust the player and expect that they will reciprocate my generosity.\n\nIn strategic terms, I can comprehend the potential of magnifying our original sum if the other player decides to participate empathically. Given that the other individual would receive three times the amount I would choose to give them, there is an opportunity here for both of us to benefit from this sharing.\n\nMy intention here would be to promote a sense of equitable exchange. Following the doctrine of 'high risk, high reward', my desire in this situation is to maximize potential returns for both me and the other player involved. Therefore, I would feel inclined to give away a larger portion of my initial amount.\n\nHowever, being practically minded as well, I also realize that there is a risk involved. The participant may choose not to return any amount, which would lead to a loss on my side, and I’m aware of this potential drawback.\n\nBalancing my innate optimism with a pragmatic understanding of the scenario, I plan to give $7 to the other player. I believe this represents a meaningful enough investment to signal trust and goodwill to the other player and stimulate a thoughtful response.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars."

As a doctor, I constantly find myself in situations where I have to balance emotional quotient with professional responsibilities. That's an important skill here too.\n\nTherefore, my actions in this experiment will be dictated by these principles. My desire is to provide the other player with an opportunity to benefit, but also encourage a sense of understanding and mutual aid. \n\nI'd start off by giving the other player $5 from my initial $10. That will give them $15 in return, which they can choose to share with me as they see fit. This seems to be a fair proposition that allows both parties the possibility to benefit from the interaction.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars."

            "I strongly believe in the kindness of strangers and the idea that we should treat others as we would want to be treated. I understand that the player on the other end of this experiment is just like me, a person who is likely to appreciate generosity and consideration.\n\nGrowing up in a tight-knit Hispanic community, I've learned the importance of helping others in times of need. This communal mindset has shaped my underlying desires and intentions significantly. My desire is to build relationships based on trust and mutual help. As such, my intention in this experiment is to establish a connection based on these principles.\n\nI have never believed in scarcity. I believe that the more we give, the more we receive. This experiment provides an opportunity to express this belief. Thus, I would give $10 to the other player, trusting that they will reciprocate the kindness. \n\nAs an educator and community leader, part of my role is to model the values that I hope my students and community members will embrace. I want to show that it's not always about personal gain, but about fostering a sense of community and generosity.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars."

I also understand the significance of trust and reciprocity in building relationships, and I intend to take these values with me into everything I do, including this experiment.\n\nGiven my position in this experiment, it is my desire that the other player and I can both benefit from this situation. It's not solely about accruing wealth for me, but rather about striking a balance that demonstrates trust and cooperation, as well as rewarding someone else's participation in our shared experience. \n\nWith this in mind, my intention would be to give a generous portion of my initial sum to the other player. I aim to not only offer a show of good faith and trust but also inspire an act of reciprocation in this seemingly simple experiment. \n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars to the other player, in the hopes that they will feel valued and understood, encouraging them to reciprocate the generosity in their own way."
