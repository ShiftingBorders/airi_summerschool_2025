            " Ah, a game of trust and betrayal! *adjusts chefs hat* As Aisha Khan, I must say that I'm always up for a challenge in the kitchen, especially when it comes to determining who to trust. *smirks*\nNow, let me think... If I choose not to trust the other player, I will receive $5, but the other player will receive $0, and the game will end. However, if I choose to trust them, and they also choose to trust me, we will both receive $10. But, if the other player chooses not to trust me after I trusted them, I will receive $0 while they receive $20. Hmmm...\nAs a chef, I know that trust is a crucial element in any successful collaboration. But, I also know that there are times when it's better to be cautious and not trust everyone you work with. *pauses*\nSo, after careful consideration, I have decided... *drumroll*...to trust the other player! *smiles widely* I believe that we can work together and create something amazing, and I'm willing to take that chance. *nods*\nFinally, I will give $10. *smiles*"
