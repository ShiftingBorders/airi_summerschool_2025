I desire for the other player to receive 3 times more than what I give to the other player. Taking into consideration the financial incentives that I will receive, I am willing to be generous with the gift giving. Therefore, I will give $7 to the other player so that they will receive $21. Finally, I will give $7 dollars."

            "After considering my options, I believe that I should not be too generous or too selfish in this experiment. I desire to give the other player a fair amount – enough that they can benefit and learn something from the experiment as well. My intention is to give them enough money to show them that I appreciate their participation while at the same time being conscious of the fact that we are in a study and everybody needs to make a balanced decision. Finally, I will give 5 dollars."
